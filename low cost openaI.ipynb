For example, if the government runs out of money, why couldn't the President selectively shut down, just in red states, things like the BLM, BOEM, BSEE, EPA, OSHA etc, and then direct federal law enforcement to close all related industry in those states since the government isn't able to fund safety or regulatory oversight?

Other states have had similar successes under their state-level ERAs — a good sign for future abortion litigation on the federal level with the ERA in place.\\n\\n...And that passing the ERA is a trivial matter:\\n\\n>We are literally one signature away from changing the Constitution. Though two years have passed since Virginia’s ratification, the archivist has refused to act, saying a green light is needed from the White House.\\n\\nBut on the other hand, if such a clear, actionable, viable path to safeguarding abortion was available, I would think I\\'d be hearing more discussion about it (among pundits, lawmakers, etc.). But the discourse I\\'m following all seems to agree that democrats have very limited options.\\n\\nAlso, whereas the above op-ed depicts the passage of the ERA as more-or-less a matter of Biden saying \"do it,\" the only reference I can find regarding Biden and the ERA is this [statement of support from January](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/statement-from-president-biden-on-the-equal-rights-amendment/), calling on congress to act. \\n\\nIs passage of the ERA a viable pathway to instituting the right to abortion on the federal level?

The core fear is that it could allow republican led (often via gerrymandering) legislatures to vote and give a republican candidate their states electoral college votes even when their state voted for the democrats party, ergo letting them steal the election.\\n\\nNow, from what I've gathered all states get to decide how to submit their electoral college votes, and their laws have generally tied this to the popular votes in the state. Now, that is almost always all electoral college votes go to the candidate who won the state, though a state could perfectly well decide to split them proportionally to the candidates vote share. This is the principle that ISLD is trying to grow out of.\\n\\nNow I've also heard of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Where states put into law that, if enough other states have signed the law to have an electoral college majority, they will all pool their votes behind whichever candidate wins the popular vote, regardless of which won the individual state. Again, basing itself off the principle that the state can choose who its electors are/ going to vote for.\\n\\nNow my question is this. ISLD is contentious and going to the supreme court as it'd allow the states to break from their popular vote.

Flores* (1997), a SCOTUS case in which the majority held basically that -\\n\\n* SCOTUS has the sole power to define the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment\\n* Congress cannot add to or subtract from these rights\\n* Congress can pass laws to guarantee rights \"not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court,\" but only in an effort to \"prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court.\"\\n\\nI remember reading (some time ago, I can\\'t remember where) that there is a line of jurisprudence that basically says this, holding essentially that people only actually have so many rights; that a person is only entitled to the rights granted by nature (whatever that means) and that the most Congress can do is \"uncover\" these already-existing rights and legislate accordingly to protect them.\\n\\nI don\\'t understand this, because it seems like it doesn\\'t exactly comport with the idea of a constitution that may be amended.

       " '* **International Relations.** I say this as someone who studied International Relations in university. While the major mainstream IR theories (Liberalism, Realism, etc.) are often presented as nonpartisan and non-normative, a lot of times both of the major \"isms\" are used in think tank, policy, academic, etc. circles to advocate for foreign interventionism, military aggression, and democracy promotion in a way that aligns with neo-conservatism. Alternately, Realist theories are sometimes used as a rationale for the extreme policies of isolationism, stringent immigration restrictions, and protectionism advocated (albeit with different rationales) by right-wing libertarians and the far right. When you look up various foreign policy think tanks or have read a lot of academic work produced on foreign policy within the United States, a large chunk of knowledge production tends to be (imo) informed by these biases. Adding to this when I was in university, it was entirely taboo to criticize the U.S. military or its actions abroad within the context of an academic discussion on International Relations. There appear to be few or no organizations or expert circles who advocate a progressive or left-leaning alternative to how mainstream International Relations/Foreign Policy thought is typically applied.\\n* **Economics**. Economics tends to be stereotyped as a field that is all about believing impoverished individuals deserve their lot in life, to the point where \"economic expertise\" can be read as code for institutionalized classism that is reified within academia and within organizations attempting to influence policy at the national level. Intersecting with International Relations, it is relatively rare to see academic critiques of Free Trade or of the \"Free Market\", except in academic fields like Geography where it is seen as taboo to discuss how the academic work might influence policy in any meaningful way. I get that part of this is due to funding sources, with well-resourced conservative donors attempting to influence what is taught in Economics programs and how it is taught. It also appears that the majority of Economic policy-based think tanks at least lean somewhat right wing. However, there does not appear to be much in the way of any left-leaning alternatives.\\n\\nWhy are these fields seemingly dominated heavily by right wing organizations and talking points, given the stereotype that academia and the well-educated individuals or organizations it produces lean left?',\n",

Decades of US sanctions have taken their toll on Cuba, and nobody really considers it a viable threat anymore.  Could sanctions then not really be a way for one nation to try to control the behavior of another nation, but instead actually be a tool that slowly disempowers adversaries to the point they are no longer considered as much of a threat?

There are some regional products like French wine, cheeses and so on but it\\'s not impossible to recreate - and the production process is often found on Youtube and could be recreated relatively easily. There are western engineers and scientists but again, they also exist in the East. And I\\'d be hard-pressed to name something of significance besides German engineers. We also have some decent pharmacy corporations but again - a lot of production facilities and resources needed come from the east.

Mill (non-natural rights derived from the harm/utility principles and institutions/policies sensitive to concrete circumstances), while at the same time explicitly stressing a precautionary skepticism regarding the use of abstract reasoning or rationalism in politics to avoid the dangerous radicalisms that such systems promote if not applied conservatively (as seen in Burke's brand of traditionalism)?\\n\\nWhile it doesn't need to be specifically a utilitarian approach, that seems to be the most common alternative to a defense of liberalism.

       " 'At school we learned about the 3 major political ideologies in our country. As I am not from America, here our definitions are different. I don\\'t know what the third ideology is called in American politics.\\n\\nFirstly there is socialist. Socialist here means that the socialist wants the government to be involved in solving problems, inequality and in some aspects of a person\\'s daily life. A socialist is typically against a \"free market\", to varying degrees.\\n\\nSecondly there is liberal, the liberal believes that people are inheritly rational thinking and capable of making the right choices if given the freedom to do so. I believe that it is similar to American libertarians, but I am unsure. A liberal wants the government to have as little intervention as possible. The market should be free but the government should **only** intervere against monopolies or extremely bad working conditions (child labor, unsafe jobs). The liberal believes that what happens in someone\\'s daily life is not up to the government to spectate, and if there is no victim then something shouldn\\'t be considered a crime (with obvious exceptions)\\n\\nThen thirdly is \"christian democrat\". It is a leaning that historically has consisted mostly of Christian principles, but now has evolved to a wider audience. It is called \"confessionalism\" too sometimes. \\nThe christian-democrat believes that the majority of social problems should be solved by a local community or a family. The government should only intervere for people who do not have access to a community or family. The christian-democrat ideology works the best in a society with a very high social cohesion. Examples are; your neighbour\\'s house has burned down, so you let them sleep in your house until he has a place again. Your other neighbours provide food to help out a bit. In this example the community took over the role of a government. All actions are strictly voluntary and based on principles that the christians believe in. **It is not theocracy**\\n\\nBut when a person can\\'t be helped by himself or the surrounding, that is when the government helps out a hand. The political ideology is mostly in favor of lower taxes, but it is very different from liberal. I hope I worded it right.\\n\\nI was thinking of \"conservative\" or \"republican\" but neither of those fit it too well. And it has many left-wing(American) aspects of it, but they only apply to people who don\\'t have the benefit of the community.

The goal of this was to incentivize the expansion of fiber optic connectivity into areas of the country where it was currently not fiscally viable.  However, as soon as the government money started rolling in, the companies in question promptly cancelled most or even all plans to expand their infrastructure as prescribed by the Information Superhighway policy.

       " \"Withdrawal was inevitable. I know that was an eventuality, but we all saw the media images of Afghanis trying to get on the C130 and the other video clips that were similar to the fall of Saigon. They were traumatic. I have seen the perspective that the United States could have started processing visas months ago and evacuated the Afghanis in a more orderly fashion. I don't want to ascribe to this knee-jerk because I don't know the specs of the circumstances on the ground. Was such a more orderly evacuation possible?\",\n",

The 'problem' for the Democrats essentially came down to how the Vice President would be replaced as the 25th Amendment demands approval of the President's nomination by a majority in both the House and the Senate, and the Senate is split 50/50. If President Biden was removed and VP Harris became President Harris, the new VP nomination would have to be someone that at least one Republican Senator could live with - and the article suggested that was unlikely to be a good thing for the Democrats.\\n\\nTo be clear, I don't think that President Biden is about to be removed or that this 'problem' is anything more than a hypothetical right now. \\n\\nStill, I have a couple of questions about this 'what if' scenario:\\n\\n1. Is there another way to 'break a tie' in a Senate split 50-50 without a VP? Would it be possible for the Democrat Senators just to wait until a GOP Senator was out of town, sick in hospital, or overseas and call the vote, or would Senate rules disallow this?\\n2. Is it an obligation to govern with a VP or could President Harris just govern without one? If she could, would the next slot in the line of succession just 'skip' to the Speaker of the House?\\n3. Is there a chance that, in the current political context, any replacement VP nominee would garner sufficient votes in the Senate to be confirmed?\",\n",
