Logically speaking though, for a light particle to travel the direct path, it must travel the same minimum distance as all other particles to reach the other side. This means that there's no room for the particle to travel more and become out of phase, so all the particles that follow the direct path must be constructively interfering with each other. As we consider particles that deviate more and more from this path, the more opportunities that the particles destructively interfere and hit the other side out of phase, though these non-direct particles can still arrive in phase with the direct route particles.\\n\\nFor your last question, I think you're partially dancing around the idea of light diffraction. There are other points that result in constructive interference that aren't the direct path of light. You can see this in single slit diffraction experiments.\"},\n",
       " {'Why did all the other hominids die out, while Homosapiens are so successful? What explains this stark contrast?': 'In the big picture, I\\'d put this down to something called the [competitive exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle).  Basically, it\\'s difficult to for species to coexist in the same niche in the same place.  If one species is a better competitor than the other, it will tend to push the other out.  There are exceptions to this rule, for a variety of reasons, but none seem to particularly apply to humans.  \\n\\nHominids have broad, overlapping niches, so it makes sense they would compete.  Often, species will divide up based on terrain.  You\\'ll have related species that live in different parts of the world. But modern humans are extremely good at dispersing and moved into all the areas that other hominid species occupied, getting rid of this location-based partition of species.\\n\\nI think this explains why it\\'s not surprising that you would have one surviving species of hominid.  Given a bunch of related, directly competing species that all have overlapping ranges, it\\'s reasonable that only one should come out on top.  And that could happen even if that one species were only slightly better at competing than the others.  Small advantages add up over time.  \\n\\nNow the exact details of why humans specifically won out and exactly how they won out are murky  (despite being a very interesting question).  We don\\'t have as much detail as we\\'d like about the behavior of various other hominid species.  There\\'s a ton of speculation but I wouldn\\'t say any of it is conclusive.  Also, when I talk about modern humans \"outcompeting\" other species, that\\'s a very broad term.  It could mean anything from direct physical hostility to simply getting at the food more efficiently.  \\n\\nWe can, however, say that while there _was_ some level of interbreeding between different species, humans don\\'t seem to have simply crossbred with other species until they disappeared.  The amount of nonhuman DNA in modern humans is low enough that it suggests that successful crosses were fairly rare.'},\n",

Is there a better way to do this?\\n\\nI think you must be overcomplicating this from the beginning somehow, because when I draw out the NFAs for the two input regexes, I get 3 and 2 states, respectively.\\n\\nSo the cross product has 6 states. But of those 6, one is unreachable, and another one is a dead-end non-accepting state which can be discarded. Of the remaining 4 states, two are an equivalent pair and can be collapsed together. So you really only have to worry about 3 states.\\n\\n(Or, if you prefer, you can solve this in a less formal way without explicitly constructing the NFAs. Hint: your second regex matches a string iff that string ends in 0. If a string matches the first regex and also ends in a 0, what can you say about it?)\\n\\nIf you'd like to check your answer, you can use http://phylactery.org/antimirov/ which will compute regex intersections for you.

As to why any particular meeting was not kept secret, that's a bit more complicated, and I don't know in that case.\\n\\nIf negotiations are done in person, it's much harder to keep secret, as the location of key diplomatic personnel and especially heads of state tend to be either public or at least well known (ie heads of state often have so much security and apparatus with them that it's hard to keep it secret if they're in another country).\\n\\nNK really doesn't have the kind of supplies or industrial capacity that would make much of a difference to the Ukraine war.

       " {\"Google tells me that a president can only pardon federal crimes & governors have the power to pardon state crimes, but I'm also reading some previous presidential pardons that seem to fall on the state crime level, so now I'm super confused.  Thanks in advance.\": \"Presidents only have the power to pardon federal crimes. Governors generally have the power to pardon state crimes. Trump is facing two federal indictments, and likely two state indictments.\\n\\nLet's take the federal indictments first. If Trump is convicted of these crimes, a future Republican president can pardon him. In fact, it is extremely likely, if not inevitable a Trump pardon will happen the next time a Republican controls the White House. Ironically, a pardon would be iron clad if it came from a Republican president other than Trump. It's still an unresolved question whether a president can pardon himself. So if Trump is re-elected, he can try to pardon himself, but it may not stick. The sure fire bet is for another Republican to pardon him. That would be impossible to challenge.\\n\\nTrump is also facing an indictment in New York state. Winning the presidency would not help Trump resolve this matter, because pardon power rests with the Governor of New York, currently a Democrat. It's conceivable a Republican could win the governorship in 2026 (they came within 5 points in 22, I think). But unlikely. So a New York conviction is the most likely to stick. However, the jailtime would be minimal - possibly even non-existent. The whole thing could get bumped down to a misdemeanor.\\n\\nLastly, Trump is likely to be indicted under Georgia state law. The Governor of Georgia does not have pardon power. Rather, the power is vested in a panel appointed by the governor. This provides some degree of insulation. But Georgia is a red state, and I imagine eventually enough pressure will result in a pardon there.\\n\\nSo there's your tally. A New York conviction will likely stick, but it won't be for much jail time. Federal convictions will last as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. And a Georgia conviction will probably be pardoned.\"},\n",

We learned that businesses are allowed to discriminate, picking and choosing their customers as they wish (under the guise of freedom of religion/speech). And then 2. Universities cannot use race as a factor for admission. Well… it seems to me that at least Harvard, being a private college and thus a corporation (sorry UNC), is allowed to discriminate per number 1 above.. so they can use race, or nepotism, or net worth, or anything they want as admission standards, right? Putting aside my own beliefs and trying to put myself into the minds of conservatives, this just doesn’t seem consistent. Am I looking at it wrong or missing something?'},\n",
       " {'Do any US 2024 presidential candidates have a plan to fix housing affordability?': 'Since Biden has been addressed, I decided to check the top 5 Republican candidates-\\n\\nTrump- No mention on the issues page on his website. In his first term, his budget proposals cut spending on affordable housing programs, so not a great reputation. His current discussion of it pretty much only concerns ‘fixing the economy’ first and then I guess housing will sort itself out or he hasn’t come up with anything past that.\\n\\nDeSantis- No mention on his website. Did pass a $711 million plan aimed at making housing more affordable that included some positive provisions for affordable-housing projects. Not sure if it has actually translated to better outcomes quite yet.\\n\\nVivek- No mention on website and no mention that I can find elsewhere. Not surprising given he is running as the Trump substitute/VP pick.\\n\\nHaley- No mention on website or elsewhere that I can find.\\n\\nPence- No mention on website. When asked about solving housing, he took the same stance as Trump in that fixing the economy- more jobs, lower interest rates, etc.- is the first step in getting there. No current plan on what comes after that though.\\n\\nBased on none of them referencing housing affordability or availability on their websites, it sounds like it isn’t much of a priority at all for any of these candidates'},\n",
       " {'Why does a country publicize key meetings with other countries when secretly doing it would be more advantageous?': \"Countries often do keep key meetings secrets, so the premise of the question is simply incorrect.  As to why any particular meeting was not kept secret, that's a bit more complicated, and I don't know in that case.\\n\\nIf negotiations are done in person, it's much harder to keep secret, as the location of key diplomatic personnel and especially heads of state tend to be either public or at least well known (ie heads of state often have so much security and apparatus with them that it's hard to keep it secret if they're in another country).\\n\\nNK really doesn't have the kind of supplies or industrial capacity that would make much of a difference to the Ukraine war.  So most likely publicization is to raise morale or talk up an ally.\"},\n",
       " {\"How come 2 of US' biggest, most prominent parties are called the Democrats and the Republicans? Are everybody not part of a democratic republic?\": \"The Democratic and Republican political parties are some of the oldest on earth still in operation. (Last time I looked into this, it actually appeared that the Democrats are the oldest political party on earth, beating out the UK's conservative party by just a smidge.) \\n\\nAs a result of this, their names don't really follow modern political party naming trends of including your ideology in the name. They pre-date the tradition.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party is, simply, named in honor of democracy. The party had a few different names thrown around when it was being founded, but the Democratic Party pretty quickly won out and was finalized as the name.\\n\\nThe Republicans are named after the Democratic-Republican Party. This was the dominant political party in the US from roughly ish 1800 to the 1820s. They competed against the Federalist Party... until they completely and utterly destroyed the Federalist around the back half of the 1810s. The Democratic-Republicans are named that by historians to differentiate them from our modern parties, but when that party actually existed they referred to themselves as the Republicans.\\n\\nSo when our current day Republicans were getting started, they took the name of the old party that used to dominate the country.\"},\n",
       " {'Why does the US have a lower life expectancy than every developed country even though we spend the most in the world on healthcare?': '1. Exorbitant healthcare costs, caused by technological and pharmaceutical patents, that make the best treatments only available to the rich.\\n\\n2. A shortage of nurses, rural doctors and medical specialists, driven by medical associations and the high cost/long duration of medical school.\\n\\n3. A lack of access to affordable healthy foods (food deserts).\\n\\n4. Inactivity.\\n\\n5. Stress.'},\n",
       " {'Why does the UN use the English Exonym as the official nation names for so many countries?': \"So the UN has 6 official languages. English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese.\\n\\nA nation's formal name is translated at the UN into all 6 of those languages. \\n\\nSo. For example, Germany is officially Germany in the English language, Allemagne in French, Германия in Russian, Alemania in Spanish, and 会员国 in Chinese. (The UN's website isn't translated to Arabic. But Germany has an Arabic translation too.) \\n\\nAll versions of this name are equally correct. None of the languages have formal priority over the other. So it's actually not correct to say that the UN uses Germany. At least, not exclusively.\\n\\nAs to why Germany is called Germany and not Deutschland? Because German is not a UN language. And in English, which is a UN language, the nation is known as Germany. That is the correct translation. And these translations can be decided by the country in question. Germany could request to the UN that its English translation be Deutschland. In fact, it could request that all 6 of the UN languages translate to Deutschland. But the German government has chosen not to do this as of now.\\n\\nSo. Basically. Germany is called Germany in the English translation of its name because the Germans are cool with that. Meanwhile, calling the country by its 5 other translated names is also entirely correct.\"},\n",
       " {\"Even if convicted, how vulnerable is Trump's sentencing to pardons and commutations by Republican governors (and future presidents)?\": \"Presidents only have the power to pardon federal crimes. Governors generally have the power to pardon state crimes. Trump is facing two federal indictments, and likely two state indictments.\\n\\nLet's take the federal indictments first. If Trump is convicted of these crimes, a future Republican president can pardon him. In fact, it is extremely likely, if not inevitable a Trump pardon will happen the next time a Republican controls the White House. Ironically, a pardon would be iron clad if it came from a Republican president other than Trump. It's still an unresolved question whether a president can pardon himself. So if Trump is re-elected, he can try to pardon himself, but it may not stick. The sure fire bet is for another Republican to pardon him. That would be impossible to challenge.\\n\\nTrump is also facing an indictment in New York state. Winning the presidency would not help Trump resolve this matter, because pardon power rests with the Governor of New York, currently a Democrat. It's conceivable a Republican could win the governorship in 2026 (they came within 5 points in 22, I think). But unlikely. So a New York conviction is the most likely to stick. However, the jailtime would be minimal - possibly even non-existent. The whole thing could get bumped down to a misdemeanor.\\n\\nLastly, Trump is likely to be indicted under Georgia state law. The Governor of Georgia does not have pardon power. Rather, the power is vested in a panel appointed by the governor. This provides some degree of insulation. But Georgia is a red state, and I imagine eventually enough pressure will result in a pardon there.\\n\\nSo there's your tally. A New York conviction will likely stick, but it won't be for much jail time. Federal convictions will last as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. And a Georgia conviction will probably be pardoned.\"},\n",

       " {'Can 501c4 advocacy groups wrote legislation?': 'Yes, but I think by the way you wrote this you may be confused about what \"writing legislation\" entails.  They can\\'t submit any legislation they wrote to congress to try and get it voted on.  The context in which they write legislation is through members of congress, who either solicit help from someone they feel knows the industry or it will happen from the other direction, a lobbying firm will want something achieved and then convince a congressperson that they have written a bill and the congressperson would gain something by sponsoring it.\\n\\nAnyone can write a bill, the tricky part is convincing a congressperson to actually sponsor it.  Unless you have a lot of power and influence, they don\\'t exactly take random unsolicited submissions for what should be obvious reasons.  A nonprofit would maybe have more success, especially if the issue they care about and the bill they write aligns with the issues that the congress member in question supports.  But there are a lot of barriers even then, since most congresspeople don\\'t want their professional reputation tied to something someone else wrote (At least a \"someone else\" that isn\\'t on their staff or doing it as directed by them).'},\n",

For example, page 11 has quotes related to a conversation between \"Co-Conspirator 2\" and \"Arizona House Speaker\".

Breeds of dogs, like breed prejudice that can exist in humans, is often a result of a society\\u2019s tendency to choose a victim, and prejudices and associated features are assigned to them.\\n\\nIn the case of pitbulls, this began in the 1980s when the media sensationalized and demonized the breed after a string of attacks and news articles depicting pitbulls as vicious and wild animals. This led to a strong public opinion that pitbulls were dangerous animals and created the idea in people\\u2019s minds that all members of this breed are wild and dangerous.\\n\\nAlthough pitbulls were not always demonized, fear and stigma associated with many breeds of dog have been around for a long time. Rottweilers are a prime example of this with incidents of aggression that eventually seen the breed deemed dangerous.\\n\\nThe takeaway is that the backgrounds and experiences of individual dogs, not their breed, should determine their character and behavior. All dogs can be dangerous and aggressive if improperly trained and socialized. Responsible owners should always prioritize training, socialization, proper health and nutrition, and exercise for their dogs regardless of breed.\",\n",

Nuclear bombs are incredibly destructive and would cause catastrophic damage to the environment, so they would not be used in the same way as conventional bombs.
