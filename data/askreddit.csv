Fast forward to the end of the year at my kindergarten graduation ceremony. My teacher calls my parents up onto the stage and sappy music started playing.

My teacher starts giving this big speech about people helping people and my parents immediately start to realize what was happening, before my parents could say a word the teacher goes behind the curtains and leaves them there standing in silence. Seconds later the teacher comes from behind the curtain with a giant box of CLOTHES donated by all of my classmate's families.

51,Why did the United States Military create a new branch of military solely dedicated to fighting space wars?,"I know that because Trump was the one who signed off on it, there's a great temptation to assume it's a stupid move, but it sort of isn't. 

The US Air Force used to be the Army Air Force, until just after WWII when we realized that air power was now its own major part of warfare, and we should probably have a dedicated branch for it. 

This time, we're getting ahead of it, realizing that space would probably be a major battleground in a modern conflict with anybody with space capabilities, and establishing a branch for it. 

Because the fact is, if we're going up against somebody else with orbital assets, not only will there likely be some form of warfare going on up there, but the stakes for humanity's future in space travel are very high. There's already a lot of garbage in the way without tons of spy satellite debris added to the mix."

71,"People who got physical punishment as kids, what‚Äôs the craziest thing you endured?","It was Christmas week. My sister and I were out of school. We were 6 and 10 years old, and *so* excited for Santa to come! Our friends in the neighborhood were out of school for the week too, so they came over to play. Everyone made quite a mess in our little playroom outside with the board games and toys, but we were just sure they‚Äôd help clean everything up before leaving. But our mother called us in suddenly, which meant everyone had to leave. We were horrified, because our father checked the playroom every night. We begged the other kids to stay and quietly clean up, but they left. We went inside,  knowing full well what was to come later that evening. We barely ate any dinner, as it stuck in our throats with every bite. We were just getting ready for bed, thinking we‚Äôd escaped tragedy for the night, when we heard our mother ask our father if he‚Äôd checked the playroom yet. Hearing the screen door slam shut to the back yard we knew it was just a matter of time before he took the stairs two at a time to get to us. And sure enough, there were his feet on the stairs, faster and faster, up up up. There he stood in front of us now, whipping his belt off his polyester pants with a *swish*. We knew what to do‚Ä¶ we‚Äôd done it so many times before‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt have to tell us. My sister always went first, face down on the bed, leaned over, no matter the crime. You always got whipped however many years old you were.  But this time? They *really* wanted to ‚Äúmake an impression on us‚Äù.

We were whipped every single night as soon as our father got home‚Ä¶ for one solid week‚Ä¶. for leaving our play room a mess at 6 and 10 years old‚Ä¶ during Christmas week‚Ä¶ with the final night falling on Christmas Eve. 

We went to the Christmas candlelight service on Christmas Eve at the church just up the street from our house. Knowing we‚Äôd probably still have to have our whipping when we got home, my sister and I tried *desperately* all day to be extra loving, helpful and sweet, thinking *surely* they wouldn‚Äôt go through with it on Christmas Eve. I pretended to be asleep in the car on the way home from the candlelight service. I was carried upstairs, where I was placed gently on the bed‚Ä¶. and told to lean over. We really did received the final whipping on Christmas Eve. 

We‚Äôve never forgotten."

Her ass fell asleep and didn‚Äôt hear me knocking but her cousin did and thought someone was trying to break in and they called the cops.

I should now explain that they lived in a neighborhood where they were the only family that wasn‚Äôt cops, so response time was ridiculous.  So, I see police lights and think, fuck I need to run.  As soon as I flip over the fence, I fall.  I stand up to have 10 guns pointed at me by all of their neighbors.  I‚Äôm trying to explain what I‚Äôm doing which is really hard when you got no shirt on, silk boxers, a Cowboys Triple Fat Goose and  OJ‚Äôs gloves on.  They cuff my ass and haul me out to the front.  

When my girl‚Äôs parents see me, they bust out laughing, identify me and tell the neighbors/cops to let me go.  One cop throws me in the back of the cruiser and rips my ass for being so stupid and letting me know I could have got shot.  Everything he said was true.

Have healed and getting back on track and so far lost 20 of those pounds. Had to get all new clothes and undergarments that fit my new body. It took some time to get used to but it's one of those ""what can you do"" type of things and had no choice but to accept it. I saw it coming and looking back it all seemed to happen so quickly. 

As for daily life, I found getting up and down from the floor to be different than before and difficult (the healing injury did not help this). Also was getting more winded with little effort. But as I exercise more that part is getting better. People do look at me different. They are less likely to strike up conversation and doctors attribute things to my weight before anything else.

His therapy for anxiety was based on ‚Äúexposure‚Äù therapy meaning that you would have to put yourself in situations that made you really uncomfortable so that the next time you did it, it would be easier. 

He took me on a trip to the mall once. Some of the tasks were embarrassing like going into a shop with ice cream on my face or asking as many questions as possible to a shop assistant until they got annoyed. 

Progressively the tasks started to become more and more inappropriate. At the time I didn‚Äôt bat an eyelash but looking back they were not the sort of thing you should be asking a 15 year old to do. Here are some examples: 

Pretend to buy a wedding ring while he watched. 

Pretend to buy a fake boyfriend some underwear and ask the shopkeeper questions about it. 

Pretend to be shopping for sexy lingerie and the therapist walks in pretending to be my ‚Äúuncle‚Äù and bursts in telling me off.

Ironically enough he really helped me learn to deal with my anxiety."

228,What person has the best redemption story?,"Robert Downey Jr.

Uh, fuck you, I literally already paid you incase I ever need this microphone to be replaced. Replace it. Now. 

Keep in mind I spend $2-3K a year, every year, from GC for over a decade at this point. 

I take this so far up the chain I am talking to a VP from one of their centers in IL, and he says HIS boss actually has authority to authorize a new mic to be sent out.

""Okay, let me talk to him.""

""I can't, he is actually visiting another center in Kansas.""

We would ride bikes and build forts, catch lizards, play Star Wars with the other kids (I always had to be Leia because I was The Girl(tm), and he was always my Han Solo), flop on the living room floor and watch the Saturday Creature Feature and eat grilled cheese sandwiches my grandma made for us.

As teenagers, we never dated. We were best friends, but we both dated other people due to a mutual sense of 'that's my best friend since forever, that'd just be WEIRD.' He dated my other friends, I dated a couple of his, but we were still pretty much always spending time together, at school or outside of it. We played D&D together with out circle of friends, we sat together every day at lunch, we passed notes and talked on the phone.

After school, we both spent several years moving around the country, but thanks to 'long distance' phone charges slowly becoming a thing of the past, and the growing popularity of the internet, there was practically not a single day we didn't talk. We visited when we could, even if it was because one of us was visiting family or another friend and it meant one or both of us had to drive hours to get together. When we did, it was always the same - sitting up out on someone's porch or front steps, smoking cigarettes and talking until unholy hours of the morning.

Finally, a bit more than 20 years ago, it happened that we both decided to move back home to Florida at the same time. We decided we'd move in together and share expenses til we were both ready to strike out on our own. And it was like no time had passed. We'd go to work, then sit up til all hours of the night, smoking and playing video games and talking, just to do it all again the next day.

One night, we were up talking, doing the same thing we always did, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I could live without anyone else on the planet, but I couldn't imagine my world without him. There was, and there is, no one else who knows me like he does, understands me like he does, makes the bad days easier and the good days better the way he does. In that moment, I finally realized that the reason I'd never been able to find what I was looking for in a relationship was because it was right there all along and I was too afraid to give it a chance because I didn't want to screw up and lose my best friend. Speaking up and saying it was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life, and when I finally did he didn't say a word, he just kissed me.

Things went pretty quickly from there. You don't \_need\_ a long courtship when you've already been best friends for 20+ years and know practically everything about each other. Funny part is, we went to our 10 year high school reunion and almost no one remembered that we never dated. First thing everyone said when we showed up was 'Aww, you guys are still together!'

We've been married 20 years now. We have 3 awesome kids, and a comfortably stable life for our family. We're both closing in on 50 now, and need sleep more than we did when we were young, but we can still sit up late now and then talking and playing video games (though I did quit smoking) the same way we always have. There's a lot more grey hair on both of us than there used to be, and a few more scars and achy joints, but in my heart, he's always going to be the Han to my Leia, the same boy I used to ride bikes and build forts with, the same one that's always been able to find a way to make me smile no matter what, the same one that still sometimes makes my breath catch and my heart skip a beat when he grins \_that\_ little grin.

He is my forever."

Also, how is the pylon considered inbounds when it‚Äôs setup out of bounds?","the receiver can only be moving laterally when the snap is made, and they can only have one player in motion at a time. and they can't be at the line of scrimmage when they're moving, they have to move back behind the line before they can move. you can have multiple players shifting to get in position but they have to move off the line and if they're not going to be the player in motion they have to get set before the snap. i think i have that right.

Neither of them are my favourite songs or anything, I just feel like I wouldn‚Äôt get bored of Don‚Äôt look back in anger and even though Wonderwall came out way before I even was born, I still feel a sense of nostalgia every time I hear it - it reminds me of late car rides back home with my dad when I was younger. Our whole family except me hate his music taste and so when I was younger the only one he could listen to his music with was me because, well, I was so small that I didn‚Äôt really care about the music we listened to.

This will require specific configurations of lighting, signal lights, and safety equipment. Some specialty vehicles that will not be operated on roads, therefore, do not need all the features of a street-legal vehicle; examples are a vehicle used only off-road (such as a sandrail) that is trailered to its off-road operating area, and a racing car that is used only on closed race tracks and therefore does not need all the features of a street-legal vehicle. As well as motor vehicles, the street-legal distinction applies in some jurisdictions to track bicycles that lack street-legal brakes and lights. Street-legality rules can even affect racing helmets, which possess visual fields too narrow for use on an open road without the risk of missing a fast-moving vehicle."""

Next up is Michigan, where you can find this unusual breed of store that's kind of like a supermarket crossed with a farmers market. Think a small to medium sized grocery, but where the ratio of fresh produce, meats, and craft brands to processed crap is reversed. 

After that, it's any metro area with immigrant populations, because they're gonna have grocery stores that specialize in Asian, Hispanic, and other cuisines. They import the good shit, and you'll find tons of stuff that just doesn't exist in regular grocery stores.

One of the things that makes those parties so fun and unique is they are one of the only times we have a party totally devoted to our own gender and it's interests. Nothing wrong with having both combined but then it is just like any other party imo. For me it is a fun excuse to do unapologetic ""guy stuff."" To have a party totally geared to one gender and have fun kind of embracing that part of ourselves. When everyone is one gender in a party the social dynamic is different than when it is mixed.
