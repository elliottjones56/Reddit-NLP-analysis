0,[MEGATHREAD] Supreme Court October 2022 Term,"I’m still baffled by many of the court’s decisions. Most recently I can’t seem to logically reconcile the following: 1. We learned that businesses are allowed to discriminate, picking and choosing their customers as they wish (under the guise of freedom of religion/speech). And then 2. Universities cannot use race as a factor for admission. Well… it seems to me that at least Harvard, being a private college and thus a corporation (sorry UNC), is allowed to discriminate per number 1 above.. so they can use race, or nepotism, or net worth, or anything they want as admission standards, right? Putting aside my own beliefs and trying to put myself into the minds of conservatives, this just doesn’t seem consistent. Am I looking at it wrong or missing something?"
1,Do any US 2024 presidential candidates have a plan to fix housing affordability?,"Since Biden has been addressed, I decided to check the top 5 Republican candidates-

Trump- No mention on the issues page on his website. In his first term, his budget proposals cut spending on affordable housing programs, so not a great reputation. His current discussion of it pretty much only concerns ‘fixing the economy’ first and then I guess housing will sort itself out or he hasn’t come up with anything past that.

DeSantis- No mention on his website. Did pass a $711 million plan aimed at making housing more affordable that included some positive provisions for affordable-housing projects. Not sure if it has actually translated to better outcomes quite yet.

Vivek- No mention on website and no mention that I can find elsewhere. Not surprising given he is running as the Trump substitute/VP pick.

Haley- No mention on website or elsewhere that I can find.

Pence- No mention on website. When asked about solving housing, he took the same stance as Trump in that fixing the economy- more jobs, lower interest rates, etc.- is the first step in getting there. No current plan on what comes after that though.

Based on none of them referencing housing affordability or availability on their websites, it sounds like it isn’t much of a priority at all for any of these candidates"
2,Why does a country publicize key meetings with other countries when secretly doing it would be more advantageous?,"Countries often do keep key meetings secrets, so the premise of the question is simply incorrect.  As to why any particular meeting was not kept secret, that's a bit more complicated, and I don't know in that case.

If negotiations are done in person, it's much harder to keep secret, as the location of key diplomatic personnel and especially heads of state tend to be either public or at least well known (ie heads of state often have so much security and apparatus with them that it's hard to keep it secret if they're in another country).

NK really doesn't have the kind of supplies or industrial capacity that would make much of a difference to the Ukraine war.  So most likely publicization is to raise morale or talk up an ally."
3,"How come 2 of US' biggest, most prominent parties are called the Democrats and the Republicans? Are everybody not part of a democratic republic?","The Democratic and Republican political parties are some of the oldest on earth still in operation. (Last time I looked into this, it actually appeared that the Democrats are the oldest political party on earth, beating out the UK's conservative party by just a smidge.) 

As a result of this, their names don't really follow modern political party naming trends of including your ideology in the name. They pre-date the tradition.

The Democratic Party is, simply, named in honor of democracy. The party had a few different names thrown around when it was being founded, but the Democratic Party pretty quickly won out and was finalized as the name.

The Republicans are named after the Democratic-Republican Party. This was the dominant political party in the US from roughly ish 1800 to the 1820s. They competed against the Federalist Party... until they completely and utterly destroyed the Federalist around the back half of the 1810s. The Democratic-Republicans are named that by historians to differentiate them from our modern parties, but when that party actually existed they referred to themselves as the Republicans.

So when our current day Republicans were getting started, they took the name of the old party that used to dominate the country."
4,Why does the US have a lower life expectancy than every developed country even though we spend the most in the world on healthcare?,"1. Exorbitant healthcare costs, caused by technological and pharmaceutical patents, that make the best treatments only available to the rich.

2. A shortage of nurses, rural doctors and medical specialists, driven by medical associations and the high cost/long duration of medical school.

3. A lack of access to affordable healthy foods (food deserts).

4. Inactivity.

5. Stress."
5,Why does the UN use the English Exonym as the official nation names for so many countries?,"So the UN has 6 official languages. English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese.

A nation's formal name is translated at the UN into all 6 of those languages. 

So. For example, Germany is officially Germany in the English language, Allemagne in French, Германия in Russian, Alemania in Spanish, and 会员国 in Chinese. (The UN's website isn't translated to Arabic. But Germany has an Arabic translation too.) 

All versions of this name are equally correct. None of the languages have formal priority over the other. So it's actually not correct to say that the UN uses Germany. At least, not exclusively.

As to why Germany is called Germany and not Deutschland? Because German is not a UN language. And in English, which is a UN language, the nation is known as Germany. That is the correct translation. And these translations can be decided by the country in question. Germany could request to the UN that its English translation be Deutschland. In fact, it could request that all 6 of the UN languages translate to Deutschland. But the German government has chosen not to do this as of now.

So. Basically. Germany is called Germany in the English translation of its name because the Germans are cool with that. Meanwhile, calling the country by its 5 other translated names is also entirely correct."
6,"Even if convicted, how vulnerable is Trump's sentencing to pardons and commutations by Republican governors (and future presidents)?","Presidents only have the power to pardon federal crimes. Governors generally have the power to pardon state crimes. Trump is facing two federal indictments, and likely two state indictments.

Let's take the federal indictments first. If Trump is convicted of these crimes, a future Republican president can pardon him. In fact, it is extremely likely, if not inevitable a Trump pardon will happen the next time a Republican controls the White House. Ironically, a pardon would be iron clad if it came from a Republican president other than Trump. It's still an unresolved question whether a president can pardon himself. So if Trump is re-elected, he can try to pardon himself, but it may not stick. The sure fire bet is for another Republican to pardon him. That would be impossible to challenge.

Trump is also facing an indictment in New York state. Winning the presidency would not help Trump resolve this matter, because pardon power rests with the Governor of New York, currently a Democrat. It's conceivable a Republican could win the governorship in 2026 (they came within 5 points in 22, I think). But unlikely. So a New York conviction is the most likely to stick. However, the jailtime would be minimal - possibly even non-existent. The whole thing could get bumped down to a misdemeanor.

Lastly, Trump is likely to be indicted under Georgia state law. The Governor of Georgia does not have pardon power. Rather, the power is vested in a panel appointed by the governor. This provides some degree of insulation. But Georgia is a red state, and I imagine eventually enough pressure will result in a pardon there.

So there's your tally. A New York conviction will likely stick, but it won't be for much jail time. Federal convictions will last as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. And a Georgia conviction will probably be pardoned."
7,What's wrong with assimilation?,I think people have a negative perception of assimilation because historically it refers to forced assimilation; I don’t think there’s anything wrong with voluntary or willful assimilation.
8,Can 501c4 advocacy groups wrote legislation?,"Yes, but I think by the way you wrote this you may be confused about what ""writing legislation"" entails.  They can't submit any legislation they wrote to congress to try and get it voted on.  The context in which they write legislation is through members of congress, who either solicit help from someone they feel knows the industry or it will happen from the other direction, a lobbying firm will want something achieved and then convince a congressperson that they have written a bill and the congressperson would gain something by sponsoring it.

Anyone can write a bill, the tricky part is convincing a congressperson to actually sponsor it.  Unless you have a lot of power and influence, they don't exactly take random unsolicited submissions for what should be obvious reasons.  A nonprofit would maybe have more success, especially if the issue they care about and the bill they write aligns with the issues that the congress member in question supports.  But there are a lot of barriers even then, since most congresspeople don't want their professional reputation tied to something someone else wrote (At least a ""someone else"" that isn't on their staff or doing it as directed by them)."
9,TRUMP indictment: All the quoted conversations within - how are these quotes obtained?,"So obviously some of them were public, so things like Trump tweets, DoJ statements, and things in public are lifted from the publicly available sources.

Some quotes are from written media that Jack Smith obtained through his investigation. Things like text messages, emails, meeting notes, and other written communication are quoted word for word from the text source.

Some quotes are videos and recorded calls (like the Trump-Kemp call about Georgia). These are obviously direct quotes as well.

Some quotes come from witness interviews (which is what I think you're referring to). For example, page 11 has quotes related to a conversation between ""Co-Conspirator 2"" and ""Arizona House Speaker"". The Arizona House Speaker was interviewed by the FBI prior to this indictement, so the quotes related to this event are likely quoted from his interview, which is his best recollection of what was said.

https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/during-live-cnn-interview-ex-arizona-house-speaker-reveals-he-spoke-to-the-fbi-in-smiths-probe#:~:text=Former%20Arizona%20House%20Speaker%20Rusty,to%20overturn%20the%202020%20election.

Jack Smith and his team have a lot of interviews as well (that they did themselves and that they've obtained from others like the January 6th committee interviews), so a lot of the quotes and paraphrases come from those interviews."
10,Why did Democrats pass a law that state anyone who campaigns in New Hampshire that delegates they win will not be allowed into the convention?,"They set the rules for their primary to ensure that there was more socioeconomic and racial diversity in the early primary period; the NHDP had and has ample opportunity to ensure that their delegates get counted. The NHDP is actively campaigning against doing so. 

These rule changes were voted on by DNC membership and overwhelmingly approved.

Nothing corrupt about it. Political parties are free to set their own rules and guidelines because they’re private institutions."
11,"How come rural folk in the USA are overwhelmingly right-wing, in contrast to many other countries?","There's a book that covers the subject, [What's the Matter with Kansas?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F_\(book\))

In a word, religion."
12,What is the legal basis for all of the recent migrants in the USA?,"The bottle neck in our immigration policy is the court system.  Immigration courts are not Article 3 courts, they are Article 2 courts.  Funded and run solely by the Executive branch and not subject to Federal court or Supreme court review except in extreme cases.

Per our immigration policy anyone who presents at the border with a valid asylum claim is given a court date to make their case.  The backlog of these cases topped 1 million under President Trump in  2019 and is on track to double that number today.  

Average time for a case to clear is 4 to 5 years and many go over a decade.  Most asylum seekers are released pending their court date.  Some have either family or friends in the States they can go live with, others rely on local support networks and working under-the-table to get by while waiting to see if they will be deported or not.  The Federal Government generally does not ship them around from state to state after the initial intake process is complete.

Border states like Texas, which have been dealing with immigration issues for years and feel the rest of the Nation doesn't take them seriously because of the big hats, have recently decided it is a funny gag to talk a bunch of people with nowhere to go into a plane or a bus and drop them off on someone else's doorstep.  But that doesn't really have anything to do with our immigration laws."
13,Why is the numbers of representatives in states/provinces not determined based on their GDP?,"Ha ha ha — that would be the most unfair system ever!       Interesting thinking, though.  People count more than money is why."
14,Why didn't more left-wing parties like the NDP supplement the Liberals in Canada?,"Do you mean supplement or supplant?

Duverger's Law says we should expect only two major parties in a system like in the UK or Canada. A party on the outside, therefore, has two discrete paths it can take: it can seek to replace one of the big two by moving closer to the centre, and broadening its coalition, or it can maintain a more extreme position and apply pressure on the major party closest to it. Conversely, the major parties also have two paths: to co-opt ideas that become popular and championed by the ideological flanks, or risk being replaced by said champion.

In the UK, the Liberals were basically supplanted by the Conservatives, who adopted many liberal positions. In Canada, the forerunner of the NDP put pressure on the Liberals to move left and build a welfare state—and they did. Canada's Liberals are not ideological liberals, they are always oriented around the political centre, whereas the Liberals in the UK during the Great War and afterward were not quite so flexible or effective."
15,How to describe the voter margin of an election?,"The first one:

> “Politician A beat them by 20%”.

If you say the second one (Politician A won by 10%), most people would think that means they won 55% to 45% (or two numbers with 10 between them)."
16,What are the politics of gang violence?,"Gang violence is political in the sense that anything concerning structures of power is political.

A criminal organization whose income is tied to their territories will want to expand. The more territory, the more customers for their services and the more clients under their ""protection."" In a city with multiple gangs, turf wars will occur when changes in relative strength or new opportunities upset the status quo."
17,"The Dutch government just collapsed, what does that mean in practical terms?","The Dutch government is a coalition of parties. All that's happened is that the coalition decided to stop working together due to a policy disagreement - namely the largest party wanted certain harsher asylum policies and the other parties didn't.

This is something that can happen in parliamentary systems where no party has a majority (common under proportional representation). It's a feature, not a bug.

The current Prime Minister will now remain in post until the election later this year.

To answer your questions:
No.
Yes.
Nothing will change.
Nothing will change.
Yes.
There is still a government.
There are still police.
No.
Only if you have a particular interest in the complexities of internal Dutch politics."
18,"Could the recent SCOTUS ""wedding website"" case open the door to discrimination against other religions?","It actually really has nothing to do with religion, it's that the government has no ability to compel speech from people against their beliefs.

A French immigrant graphic designer cannot be forced to design a poster glorifying England, a Jewish interior designer can't be forced to make a nazi-themed house, and an atheist pro-life printshop owner can't be forced to make pro-abortion pamphlets.

The intersection of protected classes was only the reasoning the government of Colorado used to try to compel speech in the case."
19,"How does ""Ex Post Facto"" apply to guns/gun parts becoming illegal after a law is passed prohibiting possession?","The crime is the continued possession, not the original purchase. These things usually have a grace period."
20,"Is the ""housing crisis"" problem easy?","This is like asking why so many Americans are unhealthy or homeless. There isn’t one answer so there isn’t one solution. Like we chose 70 years ago, to standardize on the car for our transportation. This dramatically reduced how many homes and how many people can live on a given acre of land. So the potential for new home is less. But that didn’t directly cause the slowdown in home building around 2010. That was was because of the banking crisis. Which was the result of deregulation years before. 

We also have policies that make construction harder and density harder. Including current owners who like the value of their property to go up. We also decided as a society to make home ownership the basis of both most personal wealth and the engine of the economy itself. So everyone’s looking at it. There’s also so much extra money at the top with nothing better to do, that companies are buying up property just to feed their own growth.

Japan has the most successfully unregulated real estate market in the world. But ask Americans if they want to live in places shaped liked Tokyo. The answer will be no. So ultimately we’ll need to reduce demand. Birth rates are falling but will take a least a generation to play out."
21,Is it true that bills presented to Congress are too long to read in such a short time?,"Technically true, but not really in practice.

First off, yes. Bills often are 1000s of pages.

But the big but here is that a lot of a modern bill is taken up by legalize. For example, much of those 1000 pages are citations and references to how the bill fits into the literal legal code. Aka: line x of z now reads...

It's important info for structure and courts, it's not important info for determining what the bill does. The actual effects of any given bill are dramatically smaller in length - if you wrote them out in normal English. 

And then the other big but here is that members of congress have staff. So it's not the literal congress critter needing to sit down and read 1000 pages. They can task 5 people to take 200 pages each. (Or something like that.) And present summaries. For understandable reasons, lots of people get upset by the use of staff, and believe members should indeed actually read all 1000 pages by themselves. But I'll just point out the senior leadership of every other even slightly large organization on earth doesn't operate that way. I can guarantee you that Roger Mosby - who is the ceo of the boy scouts - isn't sitting down at night to read the full report on the tents that troop 795 set up that weekend."
22,How does a person participate in a Caucus?,"Great question, and way to be proactive about getting involved!

Here’s how it goes: You show up wherever your local community is caucusing (usually a high school gym, library, church, or something similar but sometimes individual households, too).

If you have a candidate in mind to support, you walk toward their designated area of the gymnasium. If you don’t have someone in mind, you can go up to the other groups and ask why you should support their preferred candidate.

At an appointed time, the caucus leader will call for a vote, and each group presents how many people are supporting their preferred candidate.

Usually, after the first round, the *least* preferred candidate is eliminated, and their supporters will reallocate themselves to their second-preferred candidates (there’s usually a viability threshold percentage that candidates have to meet to continue on to the next round).

In the midst of all of this, people are trying to persuade you to join their group; this can take the form of actual candidate talking points, or in some cases literal bribery (eg “Hey, Steve, I’ll buy you a drink after the caucus if you join us.”)

They can get heated as people get more dug in to their respective positions. Usually there is alcohol involved for of age people (BYOB). 

When the caucus is adjourned, delegates are appointed based on percentage of caucus goers votes. Those numbers are reported, by precinct, to the state party who then tabulates and announces delegate count to the media."
23,"What does ""left-wing authoritarianism"" actually look like?","Some of that does come from trouble defining ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" as these terms are very much based in local cultures and don't mean consistent things all the time. 

""Right wing"" is starting to have a populist connotation attached to it, at least in the English speaking world for example. That has really not been the case for much of democratic history. But I digress. 

Left wing authoritarianism is usually used to refer to the USSR or China as obvious culprits, but there are dozens of other examples. Post colonial Africa is full of anti-colonial crusaders preaching equality only to become more brutal dictators than the colonial powers were. And often times they will evoke the idea of colonial powers as some justification for why their regime needs to be so brutal, trying to rebuild or reunify a country the white man tore apart, or something along those lines. 

Or take Syria's Assad regime. It's called the Arab Socialist party. People in Syria pay no taxes, housing is heavily subsidized, so is gas, and honestly before the war, most needs were tended to by the government. What many might see as left wing. But simultaneously, dissent was not tolerated, secret police ensured politics were not really an acceptable topic of conversation outside of praise of the government, and generally, the opinions of the people only mattered insofar as preventing rebellion. 

But if you're looking for examples closer to home, those are a little more difficult to find, but more importantly they run into local biases. What you see as legitimate government use of force is to someone else, an authoritarian crackdown. Canada has made what I would say are some concerning steps recently, but what others would say is totally justified. Holland also seems to be ignoring big segments of its population in order to pursue climate goals, a more left-wing objective. Are those authoritarian countries? Hardly. But nothing is ever really that binary in the real world."
24,Why doesn't the USA push to have PR and DC as states?,"They’re both quite different scenarios. 

At large, they’re both tricky because they have their own internal dynamics on whether or not they should or want to be states and their perception in the US. 

On perception, there’s often a perception that both would be Democratic safe states if granted statehood - granting additional electoral college votes and Congressional representation to Democrats. While DC likely would be based on current voting trends there - Puerto Rico is less clear. They use technically a different system of parties but in fact, the majority of statewide posts are with those who affiliate more with the Republican alliance than the Democrats. Either way, I think pro-statehood people would argue this shouldn’t be a political game - if they’re citizens have to be states, they deserve to be represented equally (and many would make the argument that they are more deserving of, for example, their respective senators than smaller current states ((that are predominantly Republican)). 

There’s a long-standing understanding that DC was intentionally created as it is to explicitly not be a state. This was, of course, before it was a thriving metropolis with a large number of long-term residents itself. That’s why, even in proposals to grant DC statehood, there is still a carve out (of various sizes) on what counts as the federal district still. Some have also proposed that it be subsumed outside of these carve outs into existing states (notably, part of the original territory made for DC has already be reabsorbed into Virginia). All to say, there’s no clear path forward on which way DC is granted statehood if it’s granted statehood at all. But notably, DC residents have expressed pretty strong support towards statehood. 

Puerto Rico is less clear. There have been several referenda - each with their own flaws. There’s a general perception in the US, especially given the dynamic above about ‘upsetting the balance’ that unless Puerto Rico chooses statehood - it’s not for the US to force it. Again, this has gone to vote in different ways in Puerto Rico and almost all of them have had some issues - confusing questions, multi-step questions that don’t grant a strong majority or even plurality, boycotts on the vote, etc etc etc etc."
25,"Poland and Hungary are similar in that they are both socially conservative, former Warsaw Pact nations. Why has the war in Ukraine revealed such a deep ideological gap?","Since no one else is here, I'll give my  take:

Poland and Hungary used to have a common interest in protecting their national sovereignty against EU norms. However (this will be important later), Hungary broke way more norms, and more fundamental to democracy, such as removing the judiciary's independence and controling national media. Meanwhile, Poland broke fewer, less fundamental norms, such as wanting Polish courts to overrule EU ones and discriminating against queer people.

This is because Poland's opposition to EU norms came from traditionalist catholicism, whereas Hungary's came from illiberal authoritarianism. 

Poland, since it became independent from the USSR, has always strongly opposed Russia (as the geopolitical heir to the USSR, responsible for oppressing Poland for decades), and the Catholic Church played a leading role in resisting the USSR, so that traditionalist catholics doubtlessly support the current democratic system against the previous one (embodied by Russia).

Hungary, under Orbán, has gradually drifted away from the liberal-democratic norms of the West, moving towards certain illiberal, authoritarian tendencies. Over time, that has led to a growing tension between Hungary and the EU, accompanied by a relatively friendly relationship towards Putin and Russia (through brotherly illiberal authoritarianism, albeit a more radical one).

Thus, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine focused the political lens on Russia vs western democracies, Poland didn't hesitate to become a leader in backing Ukraine at all levels (taking more refugees, supplying more money and arms, etc...), whereas Hungary spread Russian propaganda and disinformation against Ukraine and blocked/ignored joint EU/NATO action in support of Ukraine (sanctions, providing aid, arms, etc...).

And that is how Russia has caused the fundamental differences between those two perspectives to come to the forefront, eclipsing the circumstancial overlap is resisting some (distinct) EU norms. They are now less likely to cooperate against the EU, due to strong Polish opposition to anything Russia-friendly (aka Orbán's Hungary). Russia has united the West in opposition to it, but Hungary increasingly seems to no longer be a part of that West."
26,Why is Israel an unshakeable issue in American politics?,"It starts with AIPAC.  The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee wields outsized political influence because of the amount of cash/influence/votes it can throw around.  They advocate solely for Israel's influence, regardless of [how it will affect democracy in the US](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2022-03-08/ty-article/.highlight/truly-horrifying-aipac-criticized-for-endorsing-gop-election-deniers/0000017f-e0d4-d9aa-afff-f9dcaf6b0000) and are not above [using dark money to defeat candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/pro-israel-lobby-defeat-democrats-palestinians-2022) that would hold Israel to account for their actions.  There's also the fact that [disagreeing with virtually anything Israel does](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-is-an-antisemite-and-republicans-are-totally-cool-with-it) gets you [branded as an anti-semite](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/05/199-house-republicans-have-embraced-anti-semitism-violence/) by some, which is ridiculous but that's the world we live in apparently."

28,Will the recent actions of Hungary and Turkey affect the worlds perception of NATO?,"I doubt it.  It's been true for decades that Turkey doesn't get along so well with portions of the European section of the alliance, the recent actions are just a manifestation of that rather than a change.  It's still the case that all of them have a common strategic interest of defense against Russia which is the core of the basis for the alliance, and that concern tends to be far more important in geopolitics.

In Turkey's case it also seems that the objection is mostly done for local Turkish politics; one of the inherent difficulties of a large organization where everyone has veto power is that it gets very unwieldy and difficult.

Hungary doesn't matter all that much for NATO anyways, unlike Turkey, it doesn't control much of strategic importance.  Nor is Hungary's military all that relevant."
29,"I have just discovered Robert F. K. Jr running as a Democratic candidate. I think he seems sound from what he has said in panel conversations, but people say he has made anti-vax statements. I can't find any *good* sources demonstrating this. Can someone provide if they have a source?","I mean… Wikipedia’s sources should give you a good start. He believes vaccines can definitively cause autism, and has translated that into multiple anti-vaccine stances. He’s a conspiracy theorist. He’s essentially a Green Party candidate running as a Democrat. Look up Children’s Health Defense. He’s the chair of that group. It’s an anti-vaccine advocacy group, among other things they think are harming children."
30,Why is both US political side sticking with two polarizing candidates when choosing anyone that is slightly more moderate should result in an easy victory?,"Because the sides are far enough part that ANY candidate is polarizing.  Biden isn't someone that would historically be considered 'polarizing',  he's only polarizing because the Republicans make a point of demonizing their opponents.  Biden is quite moderate already, selecting a moderate doesn't really help.  Another factor is that elections are often less about swing voters choosing which side to vote for than about whether the voters on your side show up at all.  If you pick a more centrist candidate, then some of the voters on your farther fringe, while they wouldn't vote for the opposing candidate, they may choose to simply not vote at all; and the net effect of that is stronger.

Another factor is the nature of the primary system means that winning the primary is also a significant factor; many primary voters do not vote based on long-term strategic considerations, but based on which candidate they prefer themselves.

As to why the Republicans stick with Trump?  Some sort of shared delusional madness.  Also, anyone who turns against Trump gets shunned by the rest of the party and loses their career.

On the Dem side, there's a significant incumbency advantage, and people don't want to give up the incumbency advantage by picking someone else.  Also there's no clear top or favored alternative, so if it were to be left open it'd be a messy and questionable fight which would take a lot of resources.  By avoiding that fight they can save all their campaign resources for the general election."
31,What are some talking points on Biden's accomplishments since taking office?,"The White House provides their own list of ""accomplishments"" you can peruse. Obviously just keep in mind this is a list compiled by Biden and Harris staffers so keep your questioning attitude up.

https://www.whitehouse.gov/therecord/

This will probably be the most thorough and accurate list you could look at quickly."
32,What's With Forbes Breaking News' Political Framing/Leaning?,I’m here looking for the same answer. I’m starting to suspect FBN is not actually run by he same folks as Forbes magazine.
33,If Putin was allowed entry into the United States could he be extradited to The Hague?,"As far as I know he could still be extradited to the Hague.  I'm pretty sure US asylum laws don't provide any special protection against war crimes extradition requests; and those other things are only about protecting US citizens, not about asylees or others.  It'd be mostly up to whoever's president at the time I'd think, and could change as the presidency changes.  At any rate that customer has no idea what they're talking about as Putin would never be allowed asylum in the US, nor would he accept if it were offered."
34,Why wouldn’t NATO vote Turkey away?,"There is no provision to remove a country from NATO, unless you count everyone else quitting NATO and forming a new alliance. Even if there was, Turkey plays spoiler a lot but also has a pretty important strategic role. They are one of the most militarily credible members of the alliance, they control entrance and exit to the Black Sea, and they serve as a buffer between most of the alliance and the Middle East.

You say they openly sided with Russia, but they have been supplying lots of weapons to Ukraine (e.g. TB-2 drones) and have blocked Russia from reinforcing the Black Sea Fleet. It also is useful to have *someone* who can talk to Russia, and Turkey has mediated various agreements between Russia and Ukraine (like an agreement to allow grain exports via the Black Sea)."
35,What is the Wagner Group's objective in their rebellion? What will happen now?,"The leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, gave [two public reasons](https://www.businessinsider.com/wagner-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-breaks-his-silence-after-aborted-mutiny-2023-6) for the since-aborted uprising:

- Remove/replace the Minister of Defence and Chief of the General Staff

- Prevent Wagner PMC from being subsumed by the Ministry of Defence, as all private military personnel were ordered by the Kremlin to be put under contract with the defence ministry as ordinary soldiers

Neither objective was met, [and his actions were condemned by previous allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/prigozhin-insurrection-russia-ukraine-war-destined-to-fail-weaken-putin/) like the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Sergey Surovikin, the general who commands Russia's air forces.

Whether or not Prigozhin had objectives greater or more complex than what was stated publicly, he did not succeed, and has been excised from his role as state-sponsored warlord."
36,How do ministers in Westminster systems juggle their MP duties?,"To some degree, American politicians do 'stack' jobs, just maybe not exactly the same way. 

But to the core of the question, usually they get extra staff that help manage it. Similarly, while they don't become the Head of Government with it, US members of Congress actually do have leadership responsibilities that often gives them much larger responsibilities (including on committees as you've flagged) and in party leadership roles. And to serve those, they get additional staff and often effectively additional offices worth of staff. 

So for example, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House has more staff than, for example, a junior Congressman with no significant leadership positions. And that staff is there to support his role both as Speaker of the House, and as Representative for CA-20. 

Some would similarly argue that that kind of role distracts from a lot of their district based priorities - and in particular constituent services. Realistically - that's probably true to some extent but it's also true that the MP or the Congressman's role in most constituent services is managed by staff anyway. What is true is that their focus has to increasingly become national as their portfolio and public position demands. 

That being said, the reverse is also true in that most constituents actually see value in having their representative be in a position of additional power - and some could argue then that their priorities take an even higher priority rather than lower."
37,"Clarence Thomas told aids that ""The liberals made my life miserable for 43 years,"" has he ever gone into detail on what specifically he meant by that?","That might be a touch maudlin but he got taken to task pretty hard over a couple of scandals he had in his career. I say ""maudlin"" because I'm having trouble thinking of something that really prevented him from attaining some of the highest highs this country has to offer.

The biggest thing was probably the Anita Hill saga. There's been oceans of ink spilled on what happened and regardless of where you come down on it that's probably the closest that Thomas ever really came to being blocked from advancing. If there's any point at which his future career may have seemed to be threatened, the Anita Hill hearings were probably it.

There's a lot of noise that got made later about his wife's activism and his proximity to her and his leveraging his position to help her do her work. That may have caused a rift in his personal life that was unpleasant.

There's also been *a lot* of light shed fairly recently on Thomas' personal habits which range from the moderately eccentric (having an apartment with no furniture but a massive pile of porn) to the offensively gross (openly discussing said pornography with coworkers and subordinates regardless if they wanted to or not.) That probably wasn't a lot of fun.

As for blaming it on liberals, that scans for someone with his political perspective. There's a racial dimension to the criticisms of Thomas in that a lot of liberals (especially white liberals) expected someone like Thomas to be more liberal because he's black and that kind of criticism from white liberals, I can imagine, landed like nails on a chalk board. The term ""Uncle Tom"" has been applied to Thomas quite a bit from liberal circles and not always by people who have an informed view as to what that term means.

Again, I would say that ""ruined his life"" is a bit dramatic. He was a Supreme Court justice, was very wealthy, and enjoyed access to the halls of power for quite some time in a position that's almost impossible to get removed from. I think it's fair to say that a lot of the heat Thomas got was politically motivated but he still had a pretty long track record of objectively reprehensible behavior.

Sure, someone pointing out that you sexually harassing interns is a problem because they don't like you politically is maybe not the most honest actor but that doesn't mean that you're not doing something that's wrong."
38,What is the benefit of US power projection?,"I'm not sure there actually is a benefit, I've heard people argue that there is one but I've never found their arguments to be convincing, mostly their arguments centered around securing trade or the status as the world's most common reserve currency or something, most of which would've happened anyways imo simply due to the size of the US economy.

Part of the reason the US spends so much on the military is political; there's strong bipartisan support for military spending, and politically the average american voter tends to support military spending, and be upset about cuts in it, even though americans are under no actual threat from anything.  The very notion of fear is still enough to make them scared and favor spending.  Also the military is in ways a welfare program, with the industries for it carefully spread out all over the country, so that cutting spending means major job losses in some communities.

Some of it is also a legacy from times during the Cold War, when there was some, at least arguable, value to being able to protect areas from getting invaded."
39,Why is the US presidential line of succession the way it is?,"First: in practice, it’s closer to what you want than you’d think. If the line of succession falls to Cabinet secretaries, they can be bumped by a Speaker of the House or a President pro tem of the Senate as soon as there’s someone eligible in either of those roles (3 U.S. Code § 19(d)(2)). If the Speaker and pro tem are killed and the Secretary of State becomes acting President, then as soon as there’s a new Speaker or a new pro tem, they become acting President instead. The Cabinet secretary just serves as a placeholder before one house of Congress picks a new leader. (At least in theory. The line of succession has never gone below VP, and the kind of chaos that would result in the Secretary of State taking over is also the kind of chaos where written rules might not be rigorously followed.)

Second: There’s a problem with putting elected officials in the line of succession. If the death of an official would mean they get replaced by someone with wildly different views, that can encourage assassinations. Even leaving aside assassinations, the President is elected for a 4-year term on a particular platform, and their death shouldn’t necessarily result in the opposite platform being implemented. There’ an argument that the Speaker and pro tem should *not* be in the line of succession for exactly this reason. Cabinet officials are basically aligned with the President’s goals, so if the office falls to them you wouldn’t expect as wild a shift in policy.

This becomes particularly obvious if you start to put minority party congressional leadership in the line of succession. In 2021, both houses of Congress and the Presidency were held by Democrats. Given that, it’d be weird to have Republicans in the line of succession. They weren’t elected nationally (McCarthy’s congressional district electing him doesn’t give him any sort of national mandate). The political party that chose them as its leaders did not have a majority. You could make a decent case that the Secretary of State back then had more of a democratic mandate than the House Minority Leader."
40,Why is switching parties like State Rep. Tricia Cotham did legal?,"It isn't that she switched parties.   It is that she is voting close to opposite of how she told constituents she would vote.  

For example. If she was mostly a Democrat in the way she voted, except for being pro life, if she went Republican because she couldn't deal with being in a party that accepted abortion, I get that.  But she ran as a typical Democrat, won because she said this is how she would represent people, then said, I lied, ha ha, and voted like a typical Republican, That isn't acceptable. 

Should Democrats run people in red areas, have them tell Republicans what they want to hear, get elected then vote blue?   Of course not."

42,Is increasing the debt ceiling sustainable? Are we in a flawed system?,[removed]
43,How influential is Marjorie Taylor Greene?,">But is she actually that influential? And if so, is she influential because of her position, or is she influential because of all the attention she attracts?

She's a nationally recognized politician, which is normally pretty difficult for a House Member. There are 435 House members, and most ""politically knowledgeable"" individuals can only name a handful or two by name. Part of this is because of her controversial statements which garnered her national headlines.

She is currently influential due to the layout of the House, where a single House member can trigger a new vote for the House Speaker. She is part of the far-right membership of the House, and used that to get better subcommittees in the House. She is not viewed as an intellectual powerhouse or someone who stands a good chance at a national/statewide election, but is a figurehead for the far-right of the GOP, along with Lauren Boebert."
44,How will EBT/Food stamps be affected by this new budget agreement?,"From NPR and NBC:

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/02/1179633624/snap-food-assistance-work-requirements-congress-debt-ceiling

https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-work-requirements-food-benefits-snap-rcna86440

Namely, the bill changes the ""work requirements"" from people aged 18-49 to 18-54, requiring a larger population to show they work to receive food stamps. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this will actually INCREASE federal expenditure (as the debt limit bill also exempts veterans, homeless, and young foster care adults from these work requirements), but the GOP claims this is incorrectly calculated.

Here is the bill, page 67 is the specific text. But it should be noted it is amending a previously passed bill, so you'd need THAT bill to read these amendments into it.

45,"If one NATO country initiates an attack against another country, will Article 5 still apply to retaliatory strikes against the territory of that NATO country?","NATO is a defensive treaty. By attacking another country, any country, they violated that agreement and article 5 would be for the country that was attacked."
46,"What legal and political concepts prevent a president from ""selectively"" shutting down the government to ensure that the costs of the shutdown are borne mostly by their political opponents?","> For example, if the government runs out of money, why couldn't the President selectively shut down, just in red states, things like the BLM, BOEM, BSEE, EPA, OSHA etc, and then direct federal law enforcement to close all related industry

If you shut down those agencies, you're furloughing the 'federal law enforcement' you're expecting to close all related industry. It's not like the Marines step up to enforce occupational law when all the OSHA guys aren't in the office.

There is some wiggle room in terms what you designate as 'essential' or 'non-essential' government functions but it's not particularly relevant. Your average citizen barely notices a government shutdown is occurring. Even the industrialists you're imagining might be harmed don't notice it much because it mainly manifests in an interruption of oversight rather than an interruption in operations.

The people who *do* notice are the 'non-essential' government workers who aren't collecting their paychecks. They notice immediately - and they're overwhelmingly Democrats."
47,Why does the ACIP have such a small budget?,"The ACIP is an advisory committee. These sorts of committees are set up to give federal agencies access to expertise outside the government, but advisory committees don’t actually *run* anything and membership is closer to “occasional volunteer work” than “job.” Actually running a federal research enterprise is a full-time job that involves lots of bureaucracy and administrative work, and that’s not what the doctors on ACIP volunteered to do. Their job is just to read the research and make recommendations. If they think more research is needed they can ask for it, but that research would be managed by other parts of CDC (or by NIH, other federal agencies, universities, and/or private companies). 

Because research is managed by full-time federal employees (either running labs or issuing grants) and not by ACIP, ACIP’s own expenses are very low. Voting members are optionally paid a token amount ($250 per day spent attending a meeting, which works out to like $1500 a year), and non-voting members are unpaid. The only significant expenses are travel costs for the three annual two-day in-person meetings and the costs for a handful of federal employees to support the committee itself (stuff like organizing the meetings, distributing information, running mailing lists, dealing with travel expenses, etc.)"
48,Why is giving military aid and public support to one party in the war not considered a declaration of war?,"It sometimes is considered a declaration of war.  In this case Russia chooses not to call it such directly because they're having trouble enough, and if Russia formally declares it a war with the West then the West is more likely to use direct military force.  Right now both Russia and the West choose to not engage in a direct fight with their militaries, so that's how it is.  This also has a long history of happening; during the Cold War there were a lot of similar 'proxy wars' between Russia and the US.

There's plenty of lesser options other than a direct hot war between two powers, and if both sides are willing to use that lesser option then so be it.  It's not like any other nations get to choose whether Russia is 'at war' with the West; it only matters whteher the two parties consider themselves at war.

From an international perspective, iirc I'd say that supporting one side isn't an automatic declaration of war, it IS a casus belli though - a cause for war; if someone is supporting your opponent then you're justified in declaring war on them.  Whether or not you choose to do so is still your choice though."
49,South Korea has the world's lowest fertility rate. Could North Korea's strategy simply be to outlast South Korea and then swoop in once South Korea collapses?,"No, because North Korea is not really capable of swooping in any case.  The USA won't let it and barring some **radical** major changes in Chinese policy, neither would China."
50,Exactly what does it mean invoking the 14th Amendment?,"Essentially Biden would sign an executive order instructing the Treasury Department not to stop paying America's debts, citing the 14th Amendment as the legal justification. He would probably have to do this before the debt ceiling is actually reached, which pretty much means right now. I think the language the White House has used on it amounts to considering it as an option for next time. Someone would then sue the government, and it would go to court, eventually reaching the Supreme Court, which would rule on whether or not the Debt Ceiling violates the 14th Amendment"
51,Can a congressional district be inside another congressional district?,"Theoretically there is nothing stopping it.  Assuming this report is correct, at least one [state legislative district](https://redistricting.lls.edu/redistricting-101/where-are-the-lines-drawn/#contiguity) was created so there were a couple floating chunks which were surrounded entirely by other districts as part of one district.

Congress could require contiguity or whatever the technical term is to prevent one district being encompassed by another, but I don't believe there is a textual restriction on creating some sort of a doughnut district?"
52,How is the Rules Enabling Act constitutional?,"The US Constitution grants *vastly* more power to Congress than either the President or the Judiciary. It's easy to forget (or never even realize) just how much authority Congress has because its members usually can't muster the majorities and supermajorities required to actually wield much of its power.

The Constitution was also not really written to be robust against lawyers exploiting technicalities and logical oversights to let the nation's representatives abuse their powers. It's probably an impossible requirement to have of a constitution anyway, since every system of laws must ultimately be enforced by people.

In any case, yeah, the Constitution permits Congress to determine how the federal courts operate, and even what cases they're allowed to hear. You might say that's bad or even nonsensical, but that's the current law."
53,Why does Joe Manchin seem to hate electric vehicles so passionately?,"This is going to largely depend on the specific bill you are referring to.

But big picture, Manchin is a ""blue dog Democrat"". These are Democrats who actively seek the Center-Right of the Democratic Party, often defying the party line as going too far. This name/group was founded in the 1990's as a response to Democrats losing seats in 1994. Manchin is not an ""official"" member but has been given the title based on his politics. Manchin represents West Virginia, where Trump won by ~40% over Biden. The only reason Manchin wins is his incumbency, and the fact he routinely disagrees with the Democratic Party on many leftist issues. This is just to frame where Manchin's mindset is. Manchin must routinely align himself with the Republicans and conservatives to ensure he can win re-election. Make no mistake, the minute Manchin leaves office, a Republican is winning that seat.

On to specifics, Manchin opposed electric vehicles recently because these vehicles and their parts are manufactured overseas, particularly China. Manchin is very hesitant over spending (remember Manchin and Sinema alone torpedoed the ""Build Back Better"" plan in 2021 solely based on costs), so he opposes unnecessary tax credits and opposes the fact these tax credits support manufacturing in other countries over America.

https://rollcall.com/2023/03/31/new-electric-vehicle-credit-rules-set-over-manchins-objections/

>""American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas,"" Manchin said. ""It is a pathetic excuse to spend more tax payer dollars as quickly as possible and further cedes control to the Chinese Communist Party in the process.""

Manchin only agreed to the tax credit because it would stimulate domestic manufacturing, and is now critical the Administration is loosening the rules and letting manufacturing going overseas.

West Virginia also has very few EVs, so his constituents aren't clamoring for more EVs."

And is anti-western sentiment really that high?","I initially took it generally to mean the end of America's status as the world's hegemonic superpower. Geopolitically it's the hot topic which unites Russia and China, and it will be sweet music to Putin's ears. Dedollarization may be one aspect of it but there are others too. I struggle to believe Xi was referring to anything specific, and certainly not to Hong Kong/Taiwan/anything like that."
56,"In political science, why is it said that ""State is permanent, Government is temporary"", but also ""State has four elements and there can be no state without government""?","Former Poly Sci major here.

In Political Science, ""Government"" refers to the actual people in charge. It's similar to how we use the word ""administration"" in the United States. The Government is the President or Prime Minister and their cabinet, or the King and their advisors, etc. The ""government changes"" when a different group of people comes into power. So in the United States, every 4-8 years.

The State is hard to define, but in this context, it refers to what the ""government"" (the people in charge) are in charge of.

A Government collapses when the people in charge lose their authority (this can't really happen in an American-style presidential system. The terminology comes from a parliamentary system where the Prime Minister and Cabinet can be removed at any time). A State collapses when the State cannot do the things that the Government oversees (collect taxes, enforce laws, defend borders, etc.).The second quote simply means that as long as the State exists, someone is in charge. In a well-functioning state, there is never a power vacuum. If a government collapses, it is immediately replaced with another Government. So while a specific Government may end, if there is no Government whatsoever, then the State has collapsed.

57,What was wrong with Montana Rep Zephyr's speech?,"The primary issue Republicans had with her speech is that she is a Democrat, and other problem is that she's trans.

We don't have to pretend it's anything more than simple fascism."
58,Is it common practice for US Presidents to have advance knowledge of the questions they're asked by reporters at press briefings?,"It's not unheard of. Sometimes they want to make sure certain questions or issues are addressed so they try to figure out which reporters are interested in it or have questions related to that. Apparently Sarah Huckabee Sanders has done so before for Trump (before Trump just stopped having press briefings altogether).

https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-press-office-asked-journalists-advance-questions-report-2021-2

Part of the reason is because if you spring questions without letting the answerer at least know the topic, you're going to get a lot of punted answers and unanswered questions.

https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/17/ask-politifact-are-white-house-press-briefings-sta/

With regards to the specific question, it's possible the White House figured this specific reporter would ask about this topic based on prior interaction. They knew she would be there, and based on past information or inquiries (she's in the WH press office) they figured she might want to know about this topic. The writing on the card did not exactly match, so at a minimum they only got the gist of the question, and aren't vetted word for word like a valedictorian speech."

62,Can the Prime Minister of Canada grant permanent residency to a “favored individual”,"Under the Citizenship Act, subsection 5(4), the relevant Minister (currently the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship) can grant citizenship to any person in special cases. Specifically,

> Despite any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of statelessness or of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.

Likewise, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act section 25.2,

> The Minister may, in examining the circumstances concerning a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, grant that person permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the foreign national complies with any conditions imposed by the Minister and the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations.

The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act authority is limited in Quebec (Quebec has extra authority over immigration compared to other provinces, so both Quebec and the federal Minister have to agree for the special cases handled under 25.2 if the person intends to settle in Quebec). The Citizenship Act authority has no such limits."

65,How is Desantis allowed to openly retaliate against a political opponent with legislation?,"Well, because there's really not a good mechanism to hold him to account. Disney could sue and argue that his actions violate their free speech and due process rights. However, I could easily see DeSantis arguing that Disney does not have a constitutional right to have its own municipal government in Florida. 

DeSantis didn't incarcerate anybody without a trial, and he isn't torturing anybody at Disney, and he didn't impose any criminal penalties on Disney because of their speech. All he did was sign an Act of the Florida Legislature that altered how a Floridian political subdivision operated. Which, he would argue, is his 
constitutional right as the elected governor of Florida under the 10th amendment, and the Florida state constitution.

At least, that's how I would imagine his legal defense would go."

67,"This might be an unanswerable question, but why are politicians allowed to just not show up to their job?","The real reason: who will compel them to do their job? Typically, if a politician is doing a bad enough job, only the voters are in charge of dismissing them.

The more generous reason: politicians often spend time between gathering with the rest of their peers and spending time back in their districts. In an ideal world they'd be able to vote safely and securely via remote access and spend all their time with their constituents, but most places don't have that set up (or have actively prohibited it).

Disallowing remote voting can be beneficial in that it allows shenanigans during times when the governing body is not meeting or when some members cannot attend for external reasons (ie calling a vote when everyone goes home). More generously, a lot of virtual systems are not as secure as you might want for government business."
68,Does Sweden even need NATO membership since they are now completely surrounded by NATO members?,"Joining NATO would make it easier to coordinate with other NATO members and essentially just makes things easier in a possible attack.

Furthermore, there is a bit of politics here.  Sweden has always been heavily involved within NATO, despite being a non-member, but declared themselves ""neutral"" as it was viewed as a good compromise to help prevent the USSR/Russia from invading.  The fact that Russia invaded Ukraine pretty much made the policy come off as irrelevant and Sweden is stating they now view Russia as a hostile threat."
69,Russia's response to Finland's ascension into Nato today seemed uncharacteristically extremely watered down. Why?,"> arguing that enlargement of the pact is tantamount to an attack, etc.

At this point, it's likely just tradition that dictates which one is used, but like you said they are functionally identical."

You put your money in a bank for the benefits of using a bank (electronic payments, able to draw money out of an atm anywhere you are,  not being easily robbed for your money). All of those functions require the bank to make money as well.

Putin is just rewarding him, and keeping someone he can “trust” in positions of power that he can’t occupy himself. I don’t see any “power” that Medvedev could have over Putin."

We need a sales tax on all stock transactions. It would put an end to the computer high speed trading that makes a mockery of the whole reason we created Corporations and stock exchanges in the first place - to raise capital for economic expansion that would benefit all the people...eventually. Then we need to end the ""step-up"" valuation of inherited assets and tax the gains from purchase to point the asset's ownership is transferred to slow the transition of our society into two classes - an aristocracy of great inherited (unearned) wealth and a serfdom of everybody else."

81,What’s responsible for the massive shift in public support for lgbt rights in America?,"Positive Side: Whether people liked it or not initially, I think exposure is the key. It's been normalized in the media for decades, now more than ever. We've pushed for understanding. More popular icons coming out. The very idea of traditional marriage is a declining one. The old folks that cared (or used to care) are dying out, and being replaced with younger and more socially liberal generations every year.

I mean, just look at how LGBT folks were portrayed prior to the last two decades. They fringe, sexualized, campy. To be gay was like an entire archetype. Now? You've got very nuanced portrayals of sexuality everywhere on TV. 

Neutral: Maybe I'll sound a little crass, but the majority of people are... well, they don't really have concrete opinions. They'll follow whatever popular paradigm is most convenient. The same people that hated gays 10 years ago might love the gays now because it's no longer fashionable to hate gays. The same could be said of racists -- it's not fashionable to be racist. This doesn't stop people from dunking on the LGBT community in private, but I'd hardly call it hate. I'd just say that it's not really an issue that's important to most people, and so most people will go with what's convenient. At one point is convenient to be racist, homophobic, and/or sexist; now, it's a detriment. There's nothing to be gained, so people go with the politically expedient thing.

Negative Theory: My speculation is that the transgender community is taking the brunt of things on the LGBT community's behalf now. Outside of the LGBT, I think it's easy for straight folks to see the LGBT community as a monolith, but in truth it's incredibly fractious and full of internal conflict, tribalism, and whathaveyou. As you say, a decade or so ago, people were kind of divided on the gays, but then some time passed and the Transgenders took the spotlight, and now everyone that was wishy-washy on the gay community is now like ""hey, we're cool with gays, but THIS is too far!"" Stuff like this has been the way of progress for the last century -- the Overton Window gets shifted. One day we'll be saying ""okay, we've cool with transgenders, but THIS is too far!"" This is of course my personal speculation and hardly nuanced at all."

Either the new majority would pass a motion of no confidence and the government would respond by dissolving Parliament, or the government would call early elections themselves before a no confidence motion could pass.

In the UK, it is possible that the new majority could try and pass a law to force their choice of prime minister. However, I doubt the newly formed majority could move quickly enough to do that."

One of most common mistakes you'll hear was the USA policy of De-Ba'athification and disbanding of the Iraqi army.  This greatly destabilized Iraq, as hundreds of thousands of government workers and military personnel, were now unemployed which not only made it hard for the Iraq government to carry out its basic duties, it made the Sunni population feel like it was being left out of the new Iraqi government.  Many of these people would eventually form the backbone of numerous insurgent groups and escalated ethnic tensions within the country."

87,How does the US Senate work in detail?,"In the Senate, there can technically be any number of amendments proposed on a bill, and a vote can only occur once all discussion is over. The problem is that any senator can filibuster - delay a vote indefinitely by claiming that they need more time to discuss the bill. Under the current Senate rules, senators don't even need to keep talking to keep a filibuster going. Unless the senator withdraws their motion to filibuster, the only way to move on to a vote is for the majority to hold cloture - where 60+ senators vote to end discussion.

The rules of the Senate are enforced by the Senate Parliamentarian - a non-senator acting as ref. They decide whether bills are ""policy"" or ""spending,"" which affects how quickly bills will pass through the process. Policy bills can be stopped from reaching a final vote by filibuster, whereas spending bills can't and get to go to a vote without cloture being needed."
88,"How hard is it for a politician to ""stay principled"" while requiring so many outside sources of funding?","""Sticking to principles"" isn't a very mature way of understanding politicians. Why is Sanders more principled than, say, Biden or Buttigieg or Klobuchar? Simply having more extreme political views or liking less popular things isn't inherently virtuous. Further, from a certain angle, supporting something only because voters ask you to do it kind of does have a certain amount of inherent virtue in democracy.

What this ""money corrupts principles"" thing usually comes down to isn't actually a corruption of principles. People point out how folks get big donations from oil companies and also are not supportive of green initiatives. But establishing a causal link here is actually quite difficult. Put another way, people aren't anti-environmentalist just because oil companies paid them to be, but rather they're anti-environmentalist because they choose to be so, and oil companies like that enough to support those candidates."

90,What is the international law on trading PoWs to a country that has a policy of executing them in a way that might be a war crime?,"You are mixing things up that need correction before your questions can be answered.

Russia (all their crimes aside) is *not* executing their returned PoWs. The Wagner Group does it, which is 1. *not* officially a part of the Russian Army and 2. is technically an illegal organization even by Russian law. Now, the fact that they are still around and are involved with the Russian Army is a wholly different thing. However, members of the Wagner Group are not considered combatants by international law and as such are not accorded the same protections and rights as ""proper"" PoWs. Prisoner exchanges of Wagner members are also negotiated between Ukraine and the Wagner Group, not Ukraine and Russia, while prisoner exchanges of Russian soldiers actually happen between Ukraine and Russia. As far as the international community is aware, Ukraine is treating both groups (Russian Pows and Wagner members) the same.

In Nuzhin's case, it is unclear whether he ultimately agreed to be returned or not, but there certainly was no way to know what would happen to him. There are varying stories out there. But generally, obtaining a signed agreement from the PoW to be exchanged is a good practise and Ukrainian officials claim to have obtained a written agreement from Nuzhin.

Reportedly, Wagner expressed a wish to exchange Nuzhin for twenty Ukrainian PoW after Nuzhin gave interviews (while in capticity) where he slandered Putin and claimed to regret joining Wagner. However, considering Nuzhin's shady past (he was serving a sentence for murder when he was recruited into Wagner), many people were not buying it. There was no way to know whether he was being genuine, hence the question (after the fact) whether he singned an agreement to be exchanged ot not.

Now here's the thing: each state is first and foremost responsible for the wellbeing of its citizens, both legally and morally. You'd think that Russia would be interested in returning their own citizens safely. We know that's not... quite... the case, but as far as we are aware, Russia itself is ""simply"" being negligent in trying to return its citizens, rather than actively harming them once they're returned (other than potentially sending them back to the frontlines). By that same logic, Ukraine's main goal in the exchange is (rightfully) returning its own citizens home. Considering that Russian PoWs have, at least in theory, the opportunity to refuse the exchange, one can assume that any that are exchanged have agreed to it, which ultimately absolves Ukraine of whatever happens afterwards (of course, no way for us to be 100% sure in every single case). By that same logic, anyone who has agreed to be returned to the Wagner Group, well... I guess they could apply for asylum if particularly desperate, however anyone who is a member of the Wagner Group is by definition a criminal under international law since the Wagner Group is an illegal organization, making their chances rather slim."

4. Written in accordance with guidelines that are a mystery to most people outside those systems

There's plenty of *speculation* that this is going on and I think it's fairly uncontroversial to indicate that it's highly likely that  Russia's future is going to belong to China barring some huge turn in the war that results in an outcome where Russia ""mea culpa's"" and sanctions get lifted.

95,Why do Democrats do so much better in Montana than the other rural Western states?,"In presidential elections democrat performance in Montana has been declining since the 2008 Obama - McCain election. Giving it a cursory glance I see two big factors that I think explain how democrats do in Montana. 

1. You're on the right track with looking into demographics; Native Americans are major supporters of the Democratic Party in Montana. They form one of three Democrat strongholds. Without looking at the Dakotas, I'd say that the extra two democrat pockets in addition to Native populations explain the difference in performance. The extra two pockets of democratic voters are students at the University of Montana and at Montana Tech.
2. Since I think that the students at the two universities are the reason Montana democrats get a boost compared to their neighbors, I would expect to see a strong correlation between how a Democratic presidential candidate performs in Montana and how they perform among youth nationally. That correlation seems to hold; Obama did very well with youth voters in 2008 and less well in 2012. Clinton did alright with voting youth in 2016 but Bernie did better, and youth turnout for Clinton was depressed in the general election as a result. We can see that Bernie outperformed Clinton in Montana. And finally youth votes went up for Biden compared to Clinton, as did Democratic performance in Montana. 

So basically, you've got a bunch of young people on your two major college campuses, so when the democrats get young people excited, they get more votes in Montana."

*edit: I'm not implying a Gore adminstration never would've went to war had 9/11 occurred under their watch - just that it may have played out very differently. Or not - the big players in the defense and oil industries still might've lured the US military to a prolonged conflict in the Middle East regarless of who was in office.* 

On the other hand a different political atmosphere between 00-08 could mean we never saw a candidate Obama. 

If there never was an Obama presidency, the more racist roots of the Tea Party and eventually Trumpism wouldn't have been a factor. That isn't to say there wouldn't have been a grassroots conservative response to liberals in power during those years. 

You can speculate all day about this and there's ramifications everywhere you look, but I think 9/11 and the response by the administration in power played the biggest role in answering your question.

97,"Putin apologists might invoke a Mearsheimer-type argument that the US wouldn’t tolerate Mexico aligning with China, so why should Russia tolerate Ukraine’s western alignment? What is the best counter-argument to this?","*edited for formatting*

This is going to be pretty long, and I apologize. I am a PhD candidate in IR, so I have some experience in dealing with these arguments, and this subject.

Tl;dr:  Why is it more problematic for the US to attempt to have good diplomatic relations with Ukraine, but seemingly ok for Russia to invade in order to prevent that? Ukraine is a state with its own security considerations, and a legitimate actor in global politics. It is not up to Russia or the US to determine what they are and are not allowed to do, and Russia intervening militarily violates this, and about a dozen other well-established norms.

Skip down to the end for a summary of coutner-arguments if you don't care about the explanations for everything.

>i find it harder to respond specifically to the challenge that the west may be hypocritical in protecting its own sphere of influence while disregarding other powers’ spheres.

There is quite a bit of hypocrisy, and at some level it comes down to global norms. We as a population, and the international system more broadly, tend to have less issue with the US and the West doing things that Russia does because the norms were created by the US and its allies to reflect their actions. The US argues that they are trying to preserve democracy, which many populations can agree is mostly a good thing, while Russia is obviously not doing that. While at a base level they are doing the same thing, the norms the US invokes are more popular and generally supported than what Russia is doing.

Now, is there hypocrisy? Absolutely. The US has a history of overthrowing democratically elected governments (see Central America and Iran). They actively support Israel, claiming it is a democracy, depsite the UN rapporteur and various NGOs describing it as an apartheid state. However, that hypocrisy does not mean that every single thing they do is wrong. The US can be bad actors in many cases and still be right in others, they are not mutually exclusive. So to answer your question, I would say that simply acknowledging the hypocrisy is a fine thing to do. Two things can be bad at the same time - Russian imperialism and American imperialism. Placing the blame on the west directly downplays the role of Russian imperialism in this war against Ukraine.

>should we expect Russian to allow its neighbours to align with the west.

The argument that I make is that Ukraine is not a play-thing for great powers. If you take traditional IR theory approaches, this holds true in almost every case. Even realism (what Mearsheimer attempts to use) would suggest that all states are self-interested (not just great powers), and will do what is best for their own security. His argument, simply put, is that the US and the West goaded Russia into this by getting closer to Ukraine, and Russia's self-interested, security-based response was to stop it via force. 

However, is Ukraine not also a state with its own security considerations? Ukraine is a democratic state that, when threatened, will do what it needs to do in order to protect its security. In this case, they are moving toward the West for security guarantees. This move West is also based in norms (democracy, liberalism, etc.) but to me it is no more complicated than Ukraine being a legitimate actor in the world and doing what it feels is necessary to protect itself. Why is Ukraine always excluded from these discussions when they are the ones being invaded? Why are Russia and the US the only states anybody talks about, when there is a third, relatively large state at play here? Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 should be all the evidence anybody needs to understand why Ukraine wants to be closer to the West.

Given that we do have globally established norms (like the norm of non-intervention, and the norms that you cannot acquire territory or alter borders by force), the case for Russia being in the wrong is clearly present.

>What is the best counter-argument to this?

For me there are a few. To summarize:
1)That is a completely hyperbolic argument. Since the end of the Cold War there are actually very few such cases of this happening (at least that we know of). It doesn't matter if we *think* the US won't tolerate it, we *know* Russia will go to extreme lengths to prevent it. These are not the same.

2) Ukraine is a sovereign state that can do what it pleases. If that means turning to the West, so be it. If Russia wants better relations with the West (which I am convinced it does not, but that's a separate issue), it is up to them to be adults and not invade a country if it gets too close to the other ""side"". Russia themselves push states away with their rhetoric and actions, and Ukraine turning to the west is a natural conclusion of this.

3) Mearsheimer purports to use realism for his analyses, and he talks about rhetoric and discourse of pro-NATO sentiments in Ukraine. But in realist conceptions of state action, discourse and rhetoric don't matter at all. So the argument that ""Ukraine saying they want to join NATO is enough to make Russia invade"" is absolute nonsense, because realists don't believe in words, just actions. And Ukraine has never had a chance of joining NATO, nor do they in a million years.

4) Mearsheimer wrote a piece called ""The False Promise of International Institutions"" and in it, decried their ability to have influence in global politics. But I guess NATO, an international institution, is the exception? Either institutions are weak and powerless, or extremely influential and powerful, but they can't be both.

5) Mearsheimer's argument is inherently hypocritical. ""It is the US' fault for bringing Ukraine into its sphere of influence!"" But I thought that great powers acted in their self-interest? So it's wrong for the US to be diplomatically friendly with Ukraine, but I guess it's fine for Russia to use an overwhelming military intervention to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence? His argument is just so thin, and not even logically coherent.

6) My final response is rooted not as much in Mearsheimer's argument, but just in reality more broadly. Look at Putin's own writings from before the invasion - he barely talks about threats from the West or NATO. His focus is on ""the mistakes of Lenin"" in devolving power to Ukraine (or as Putin calls it, ""The Periphery""). He does not believe Ukraine is a legitimate state, and in his ""manifesto"" calls for its restoration into Russia. This is imperialism, full stop. Putin is an imperialist, and the argument that it's all America's fault completely ignores that core fact, and itself is entirely hypocritical. If it is wrong for the west to be imperialistic, it is also wrong for Russia to be. Russia is as much an actor with its own objectives and ambitions, and placing all the blame on the west is just a weak argument.

Anyways, if you made it this far, thanks! Let me know if you have any questions or want any clarification, I'm always happy (genuinely) to take a break from writing my dissertation to talk about it."
98,What's the mix of capitalist AND socialism?,"You are basically describing modern capitalism in most parts of the world. Most capitalist countries have ""softened"" capitalism with certain socialistic values to ensure the weaknesses of capitalism are mitigated.

The opposite of this--capitalism taken to an extreme--is called lassez-faire capitalism and is generally considered to be a historical failure, even in the context of US history. Capitalism is an ideology, and all ideologies have weaknesses when taken to the extreme. Why would capitalism be any different?"

102,Does George Santos have any strong supporters or backers at this point? What sort of power does he actually wield given he is on no committee and is so deeply unpopular?,"Santos was always an outsider with minimal connection to the Republican political establishment. So he hasn't really lost power so much as he never had it. It's fairly clear that he's not going to build many connections within Congress and his chances of re-election weren't all that great even before all the revelations about his truthfulness.

However, there's an old saying: there's no such thing as bad publicity. The focus put on him by the Democrats is ensuring that he'll probably have a long and fruitful career even after he leaves office. He just hasn't gotten a good enough offer to step away. He might as well continue to collect his paycheck and - more importantly - the tremendous publicity from all the attacks against him."
103,What are some policy solutions a government can enact to address environmental racism?,"Probably the best solution would be to stop using such an inaccurate and unnecessarily inflammatory term like 'environmental racism'.

104,What is the correct process for a president/vp to review past classified docs?,"Officially, all classified information must only be read, modified, and contained in a secure facility, or a secure safe/cabinet explicitly designed for handling classified material. You can hand carry and mail classified info through specific carriers, but once the transit is complete it must be stored back in an approved container.

I’m not sure about senators, but some high ranking officials are able to effectively have a “office at home”, which includes some means of accessing and storing classified information. However, the rules still apply for storing and handling classified info.

The President and Vice President are at a high enough level where they would absolutely have their private home re-modeled to store classified info. What they should have done (and didn’t) is take only the information they needed at the moment, then when they were done return it to the specific container it belongs to. They should have staff responsible for ensuring that all materials in that container are eventually returned to a secure facility. 

Unfortunately, this is an issue that plagues the national security ecosystem in general, and given that most senior officials haven’t been indoctrinated like their staff are, lapses in procedures are bound to happen. 

Biden and Pence’s staff did the correct thing and immediately reported the classified information to the National Archives and DOJ. Any discovery of improperly handled materials must be reported. Though you may still get in trouble for mishandling the information, hiding the fact that you mishandled it is a far worse situation legally.

My prediction is that, based on their cooperation, the officials that cooperate will be hit with a fine (which is negligible, but proves that this lapse still has consequences)."
105,(US House) What stops the House Majority from kicking all of the minority off their committees?,"To my understanding there is no legal issue preventing the majority from kicking the minority party off committees in general; or at least there's no constitutional issue with it.  The specific rules of the House adopted each session may contain some restrictions, but I haven't heard of any, and they could certainly be changed if the majority were willing to change it.

I'm not sure I'd call it 'courtesy' that they do not do so.  But a form of institutional inertia may apply; there are some rules that have been as they are for a very long time, and there is reluctance to change them.  It's also the case that when misdeeds are done on topics like this, it's often by pushing at the borders rather than by truly blatantly changing things.  So one would want a rationalization and/or allegedly good reason before doing so.  It also means that from a political standpoint, it's safer to do more limited removals like the Republicans did on Omar rather than to take more general action.  It's easier to justify it to themselves, and easier for their base to rationalize, if it's more limited.  There's also of course the fear that the other side will do the same to you, which undoubtedly has some effect.

One simple reason not to remove people is that the majority party already gives itself the majority in each committee generally, so as long as they agree with each other they can already do what they want with the committee.  As such there's far less reason to bother kicking people out regardless of the situation."

The distinction is that if a strike is lawful, workers have certain protections. Most notably that their jobs will be waiting for them when the strike is over. If a strike is unlawful, their employer can simply fire them and hire replacements.

In Massachusetts (and some other states), public sector employees are not allowed to strike. If you walk off your job, you're not 'striking'. You're just quitting without notice. If you encourage others to collectively walk of the job, you can be fired for that conduct even if you remained at your post.

So basically what the judge is saying is that if they want to quit their jobs, they can. But if they want to continue working for the Commonwealth, they need to show up to work."
108,Can a candidate committee have a holding company?,"A campaign committee is usually a non-profit tax exempt organization. It is not an LLC, and is usually not required to have any specific type of organization (but it usually just called a PAC.

I've opened a few dozen, and while the exact requirements vary state to state, there's not a lot that is usually required for it.

As a result of that, there cannot be a holding company or parent organization for campaigns or other PACs."
109,Did Bush push for the invasion of Iraq because he genuinely believed Saddam Hussein was an evil man who needed to be stopped? Or was the invasion for political gains?,"When the U.S. liberated Kuwait in the early 90s, there was never a formal cessation of hostilities despite the popular belief that the 'war was over'. Rather, the U.S. continued to provide security guarantees in the area and the Iraqis kept shooting (albeit rather ineffectually) at U.S. troops.

So the invasion of Iraq was merely a resumption of active hostilities. Moreover, it was a resumption of active hostilities favored by the Clinton Administration because it was deemed necessary to resolve the conflict. However, the Clinton Administration had no way to sell a full-scale invasion to the American public so it was never seriously discussed as an option - the same way the Clinton Administration was willing to launch perfunctory airstrikes at Al Qaeda facilities in places like Afghanistan and Sudan but not to commit ground troops.

Then 9/11 occurs. This provided the Bush Administration with a rationale for resolving the Iraq conflict that the Clinton Administration lacked. Moreover, by this point Saddam Hussein had ordered the resumption of the Iraqi development of nuclear weapons. Curiously enough, these orders would never be acted upon because his subordinates found it impossible to pursue nuclear weapons under the sanctions regime and simply lied to him about their progress.

Western intelligence agencies would learn about these lies but not the fact that they *were* lies. As a result, the consensus of Western intelligence was that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons.

Given the ability to muster popular support behind an invasion, the perceived need to stop the development of nuclear weapons and the interminable ongoing conflict, a decision was reached to invade Iraq. Note that this decision would have likely occurred regardless of who was in the White House.

In terms of Bush's attitude towards Hussein, it's impossible to know. However, it's likely that Bush didn't view Hussein as any more innately evil than most other authoritarian rulers of his ilk - indeed, he probably viewed him as substantially less 'evil' than the regimes in places like Iran and North Korea because Hussein didn't base his entire power structure on a mythology of opposition to the West. In terms of political gains, there really weren't any in the partisan sense. The invasion could potentially lead to a more stable international order, but it wasn't going to provide any meaningful benefit to Bush himself."

Federal states are often larger in territorial size, which is especially true of the US, Argentina and Australia, and to a lesser degree perhaps Germany."
115,Why democracies don't provide arms and military support to protesters/rebels in dictatorships?,"This was done in 1984. The CIA provided arms and training in their use to a small group of rebels in Afghanistan, the Mujahedeen. These later became the Taliban. Perky little upstarts, weren't they?

One of the issues with supplying rebels is in discovering what their actual agenda is. Rebel groups come and go and morph into other forms as a matter of necessity. They are also susceptible to being subverted by other groups. This is much more difficult to do with a ""government in exile"" or a challenger who may have lost an election fairly or otherwise. Their agenda is generally pretty well established, and this can lend an air of legitimacy to an arms provider. Consider, for instance, the Colombian rebels who were supplied arms by the CIA and how Ronald Reagan referred to them as ""freedom fighters"". The fact that payment was made in cocaine was disregarded until the Iran-Contra Congressional hearings."
116,What's the difference between a polity and a state?,A polity is a group of people who are organized under a government. A state is a political entity that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a given territory.
117,What geopolitical concerns did Congress have which encouraged it to shut down the US participation in the league of nations?,"The US generally had a policy of ""isolationism"" prior to WWII. Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 on a platform of remaining ""neutral"" in WWI. He walked back that promise only after he was elected and put the US in WWI after he was re-elected.

So when WWI ended, many politicians wanted the US to return to isolationism, and were afraid entering into the League of Nations would drag the US into European and other foreign conflicts. So while Wilson helped set up the organization, his pleas for the US to join were rejected by Congress who preferred to return to the pre-WWI mindset of isolationism.

That was the major reason for the US failing to join after WWI."
118,"China's rise has been meteoric in part due to its massive workforce and authoritarian-led production efficiency. Can India, which now boasts the world's single-largest country population ever capture the same power of China? Why not?","The biggest difference is efficiency. Policies in India's democracy, even if corruption is somehow stopped, take longer to work their way through the political process into implementation. China's small authoritarian gvt is able to take an idea and get it going in a much faster time. 
I'm not against democracy, but India is enormous and their democratic processes take a long time for a policy idea to break ground."
119,Why are political parties with the word 'people' right-wing?,"While these parties now are run-of-the-mill center-right parties, they all have their roots in European Christian Democracy, which was a movement that aimed to find an alternative to liberalism and socialism based on the teachings of the ""church."" (which Church that was depended on the party and the region). 

The first of these parties that used the name ""People"" was the Italian People's Party which took its name from one of its founders Luigi Sturzo who had developed an ideology he called *Popolarismo.* The idea of being the party ""of the people"" was meant to contrast itself with liberals, who were ""the party of individuals,"" and ""socialists,"" who were the ""party of the working class.""

The other parties took their names from their"
120,Has Russia broken any diplomatic promises since WW2?,"You should ask this in /r/NeutralPolitics if you want sourced answers.

Anyway your colleagues are wrong…

Russia has broken various “diplomatic promises”. E.g the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris, which guarantee the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of states, the inviolability of borders, distancing from the threat or use of force, and the freedom of states to choose or change their security arrangements. Joining Nato is to choose a security arrangement."
121,Can a dem change to rep in order to force a vote to vacate Kevin McCarthy?,"Any democratic member of the house can also call for a vote to vacate. It's not up to just republicans. 

Not sure if they will though. I would like them to use this card when the republicons try and do stupid stuff."
122,Why was the election of the President Pro Tempore of the 188th Congress unanimous?,"The president pro tempore is a ceremonial position.  The majority leader has all the real power.  

I don't know how that position gets decided but I imagine it happens behind closed doors."
123,Why do term limits seem to be both a left/right wing agenda item?,"There are two main things to unpack here. First, the spectrum of autocratic vs. democratic isn't really a real thing. That's basically borrowing from the political compass, which is complete hokum, to put it kindly. The opposite of democracy is not authority. In fact, every system of government actually depends on authority to a certain extent, *especially* democracy. If you did some better study and read some quality political books, this will never be a real axis around which to think about political cleavages. It's purely something made up by libertarians to make them sound better.

Second, term limits aren't really being pushed by anyone who has any understanding of how political behavior actually works and wants it to be effective. Gaetz and crew are anti-government extremists, and when the other side has had folks that are also anti-government extremists then they have both considered this kind of thing, but it's almost objectively a *terrible* idea. This sub has discussed the concept many, many times, and here's the most recent thread explaining why term limits are an awful idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask\_Politics/comments/10661ll/why\_do\_term\_limits\_seem\_to\_be\_both\_a\_leftright/"
124,"Does anything actually bind McCarthy to the ""concessions"" he made to the freedom caucus or can he simply go back on his promises if he so-desires?","Well, if he doesn't do what he promised, and doesn't immediately write the rules in the fashion he said he would, then he would likely find the 20 holdouts will go right back to holding out as soon as the House does anything. The thing preventing McCarthy from reneging is that he has to get their votes in order to effectively govern. This is why a short-term deal with the Dems to resolve the Speaker crisis wasn't going to work. Electing a Speaker isn't just about getting a guy in the seat, it's about determining a governing majority that can carry a majority of votes most of the time, and basically of the time on very routine issues. McCarthy lying and just doing what he wants would end his governing majority AND end his chances of ever getting it back."
125,[Megathread] House Speaker,Why don't moderate Republicans punish McCarthy for giving so many concessions to the far right extremists?
126,What in essence do the Wilsonian terms of alliances and collective security mean?,"I haven't read World Order, so perhaps my explanation is different than what Kissinger has in mind. 

In US political discourse the term alliance has at times had a negative connotation based on the warning about 'entangling alliances' by George Washington. An alliance can be seen as negative, because a state will have to go to war in case an allied country is attacked, otherwise an alliance is meaningless. That means you can get sucked into someone else's war. With warfare being quite common between European powers historically, that is quite a risk. 

Wilson tried to sell his vision for the world after World War I in the form of his Fourteen points plan and the League of Nations. The distinction he made between ordinary or the old form of alliances and the new form is that the former was between two or a few states, whereas the latter is an alliance between all (or at least many) (democratic) states. The collective security element is that if one of these countries is attacked, all other allied states respond as if they were attacked at the same time by the aggressor state. Does this explanation make it clearer?

What I think Kissinger is arguing is that it is a nice idea, but does not necessarily work in practice. One question that was asked in France on the eve of World War II was: ""Pourquoi mourir pour Dantzig?"", ""Why die for Danzig/Gdansk?"". In short, why would you want to send your own men to their death for a war between foreign countries? The assumption is that these allied foreigners would also send their men in case your own country is attacked, but why would they? Is that a realistic promise? In the case of Munich '38 it showed that the Western powers were not willing to send their troops against Nazi Germany over the Sudetenland, even if Czechslovakia was formally their ally. This of course only emboldened Hitler to invade Poland as well."
127,Is there any Congressional rule preventing Dems from finding 6 willing Republicans and all voting together for a centrist Republican speaker?,"There is no rule against the formation of a coalition government, and it wouldn't even be the first time in the US House, it just hasnt happened since before the civil war"
128,Is China’s involvement in African infrastructure and trade a bad thing? What are the benefits for the various nations? What are the disadvantages?,"There are two primary lenses to look at this, a moral one and a realpolitik one.

The moral one answers the ethical question of the goodness inherent in an act. The second answers the question of power advantage. 

From an ethical standpoint, minus the question of loan terms, this is a good thing for the African continent which needs capital to develop. 

From a realpolitik standpoint, China believes it has much to gain by developing influence in the region and I believe this to be true. Through its lack of a colonial past, China enters Africa with less skepticism than (white) western powers and is able to develop favorable relationships with many African nations though its unrestricted initiatives. This relationship improves its access to raw materials, and forms closer ties with a part of the world expected to develop significantly this century (dubbed,  ""The Century of Africa""). 

China knows it will be the world's strongest power as a matter of course, and they not only have many enemies and threats but must develop friendly ties and allies for support. Others here far better versed than me may speak more to the geopolitical advantage gained at such minor cost to China, but it is certainly a small price to pay for the support."
129,Why don’t democrats just vote to approve McCarthy as speaker?,"It's not just about having a person in the seat. It's about building a governing coalition, which means being able to command a majority, most of the time, especially on very basic matters. The Speaker ceremony is important because it's literally the most foundational possible thing a governing coalition can do, and it shows that a leader has the ability to get a majority. But right now, the Reps can't even pass that test.

If the Dems did help McCarthy get elected, what would be the point? The minute McCarthy tried to call his first vote, this would still happen. All it does is punt the problem down the road, or force the Dems to constantly be in a position where they are helping McCarthy do the job in a way the Dems don't agree with. What's the point of that? 

Now, if McCarthy approached the Dems about a plan to gain some of their support in exchange for concessions about how he would lead his governing coalition, then we'd have a different story. Then it would make sense, depending on the deal, for Dems to join McCarthy's efforts to lead. But McCarthy has made no such overtures, and rather still plans to explicitly keep the Dems out of his governing coalition as much as humanly possible. Why would the Dems be leaping up to prop him up in that case? Especially when he can't even lead his own party?

This is actually not really about partisanship at all. It's about the basic math of democracies need to carry majorities to be able to function, and right now McCarthy can't clear that bar on the most basic, most simple of issues. The Dems helping McCarthy on one vote won't fix that fundamental issue unless they were willing to help him out on lots more votes...which obviously isn't a reasonable expectation."

131,"From 1931 to 1995, the Democrats held the House majority for 60 of the 64 years. What was the reason for their dominance?","Let's start back at the Civil War. After Reconstruction ended, the Republicans enjoyed a similar span of dominance. Part of this was due to the fact that the South was effectively excluded from voting for a long period of time and part of it was due to how Civil War pensions gave Republicans a strong base of support.

However, the Republican Party started splintering between various wings in the early days of the 20th century, giving Democrats an opening. Coupled with the 'Solid South' that delivered reliable Democratic votes, this improved their chances.

At the same time, the Democrats had their own problem. They were essentially two different parties: the Southern Democrats and the Northern Democrats. The problem was that the Southern Democrats were an obstacle to electoral success in the North. However, once the Great Depression hit, the lack of effective response from Republicans coupled with Democratic promises of generous federal social programs made them more competitive in the North - especially amongst black voters who were otherwise unwilling to vote for the party of slavery/Jim Crow.

This 'FDR coalition' would last for the next few decades. However, while Jim Crow may have been politically unpalatable outside of the South, it did prove to be a substantial barrier to the South joining the rest of the nation economically. Once Jim Crow fell (and, arguably, air conditioning technology became more widespread), the South stopped being 'solid' for the Democrats and the parties started forming into more balanced insiders vs. outsiders dynamic."
132,why is it so important for China to ensure that North Korea does not collapse?,"A North Korea collapse would lead to a major humanitarian and security crisis, as not only would China have to deal with a massive refugee crisis but would have to worry about what will happen to the numerous WMDs North Korea has.  Preventing a total collapse is one of the few things all countries in the region agree on."
133,How is it that the Palestinian population is growing this fast?,"Their growth rate isn't that different from many other middle east or african countries, at least not as far as I Can tell; they seem quite similar to those of nearby Jordan.  The conflict may be present, but the number of actual deaths involved is not high enough to significantly affect growth rates."
134,Not long after reunification Germany once again became the strongest nation in Europe. What is their competitive advantage? Asking as an American,"Germany has a large population, a strong set of natural resources, a decent geographical position, etc. From a purely ""if we made real life into Civilization 6"" kind of perspective, it's really not hard to see why Germany is successful.

I'd also like to argue that Germany's political system is particularly effective, which allows it to create effective laws that then divvy up these various resources effectively across society for the benefit of the political entity and the citizens living within Germany."

136,Why are the Cook Islands considered independent by the United Nations but not Greenland when they have a fairly similar status?,"Cook Islands are not recognized as a member state of the United Nations either, so not sure what you are referring to here specifically.

They have more representation in international organisations because the Cook Islands are in what is styled a 'free association' with New Zealand, which recognises full political independence of the islands (as well as Niue). Greenland has been granted home rule but its foreign policy and security policy are the constitutional responsibility of Denmark.

Greenland's status is not unusual in global politics; you can look at other 'constituent countries' like Curaçao (represented by France in the UN) which are self-governing but are not full members of the United Nations."
137,How did the Helsinki Accords tank Ford's re-election campaign,"I mean Ford was already an unelected President who had pardoned Nixon; Carter was ahead by 33 points in the polls after his nomination, so it's not really unreasonable to think the Helsinki Accords did not play a big role---so I guess you have to answer the question, ""DID the Helsinki Accords tank Ford's campaign"" first before asking why second."
138,How did American and Canadian Governments Differ?,"Okay so I feel like I'm pretty qualified to answer all this. I am Canadian, I've worked in parliament, and I studied both political science and history. Finally, my time has come. 

Americans think Canada is some magical place a lot of the time. That's obviously not true, but not a ton of Canadian news filters down to Americans so the image sticks. We are absolutely more authoritarian than the United States and always have been. Where people get confused is that it's also a lot more left wing than the US. 

For example. The father of the current prime minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, once called the job of the prime minister: ""a dictator with a smile"". In reference to the fact that there are precious few checks on the PM's powers. You may not think of the office of the President as being constrained by the legislature and courts, but compared to Canada, it is absolutely kneecapped. Part of this is due to the fact that there is no office of the Prime Minister in the same way that there is an Office of the President. The Prime Minister is both the PM and the leader of his party in the legislature. This means that if he wants a bill passed, he gets his party to pass it exactly as he likes. The reason that matters is because if he is the Prime Minister, it also means his party has a majority government in the House, and will be able to pass the bill without problems. (Not dealing with the exceptions for now). There is no seperate election for Prime Minister. The guy with all the power in the legislature gets all the power in the Executive, all of the time. Our Senate is just a rubber stamping machine because they're appointed by the Prime Minister. 

The provinces do have some power over the Federal government, but the federal government has pretty reliable ways around those divisions of powers if they need to. For example, any time a province moves towards restricting abortion, the feds can pull the 1/3 of healthcare funding that comes from the federal government. Considering healthcare is usually the #1 expenditure from provincial governments already, it's an extremely effective threat. So despite the fact that on paper, healthcare is a provincial matter, it's all kept on the straight and narrow by the feds. 

Another example, the recent trucker's protests. The federal government was fed up that the provinces weren't acting so they (among other things) nationalized the police force. 

The USA doesn't have a lot of that, and the list keeps going. I know it's trendy to say the US is authoritarian, and maybe it's even trending that way, idk. But you guys are coming from a place of a much deeper rooted sense of individual freedom and autonomy than Canada does historically. 

I mean, until 1982, we literally didn't have a supreme court, it was still a court in Britain. And even then, out supreme court is also appointed by the Prime Minister, and we aren't even required to have hearings like you do in the US. The US system isn't exactly good by any means, but that's still leaps and bounds more accountability than Canada's system. 

Yeah, we have healthcare and a stronger social safety net and generally more social programs. But don't confuse a left/right axis with an authoritarian axis, as much as I hate the political compass. Canada is a much more centralized government system than the United States, and it's not close."
139,Can multicultiralism work without autocratic tendecies like Singapore and former Yugoslavia?,"Okay. There's a lot to unpack here.

First of all, be careful when generalizing about a whole group of people, especially without solid statistics. You might be surprised to find out that, in the United States, immigrants on average commit crime at lower rates than people born in the country (if you ask, I can try to find the study). I don't know what the statistics would be for Sweden, but that gets to my second point.

People are the product of their environment. Crime is born not out of someone's essence, but out of their desperation. Getting into the US is hard, but staying is potentially easier than in much of Europe. The US' lingua franca is English, which is already widely learned as an auxiliary language (a quarter of the world's population can speak English). Swedish has a fraction of as many speakers, meaning more immigrants will have to go through more language training than if they'd immigrated to a country that uses a widely-understood international language, such as Mandarin, French or Arabic.

As much as cultural conflicts rage on in my country's politics, immigration from Germany, Ireland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Latin America and elsewhere has slowly been changing the idea of what being ""American"" means. It used to always mean ""British-descended Caucasian, Protestant, etc."" Nowadays many, myself included, believe being ""American"" is more about the choices you make, not whomever you're descended from or whatever you believe in. That attitude change has gone hand-in-hand with a greater tolerance of multiple cultures, faiths and heritages than ever before in my country's history. I suspect Sweden has not had those waves of immigration opening up the idea of what it means to be ""Swedish."" If anything, Sweden's historical interactions with other European powers have probably caused a hardening of Swedish identity to distinguish it from that of its neighbors.

When the Mafia controlled the Italian-American communities in the early 20th Century, it was often because young men in those communities couldn't get legal work from willing employers. When the cartels of today get away with murder in Latino-American neighborhoods, it's often because of the fear that someone's gonna get deported if the police get involved. Xenophobia breeds crime and lets it fester. If crime really is higher among the Syrian immigrant population of Sweden, I believe a homogeneous image of ""Swedishness"" and outright prejudice are most to blame."
140,There seems to be small niches on the American left and right that do not support Ukraine's defense against Russia. How are so many left and right leaning folks agreeing on this? Why?,"A few possibilities:

1. General anti-war sentiment/isolationism. If you're on the fringe-left, support for Ukraine might look like an excuse to pump money into the military industrial complex and perpetuate war. On the right one might see it as wasting resources on something that isn't obviously in the national interest. 
2. Skepticism of ""the establishment""; which I'll define here as career politicians (e.g. senior congressional leaders + well known centrist figures from both parties) and experienced civil servants. This is something that's common on both the far-left and far-right, which you can see for things like vaccine skepticism and yes, belief in certain conspiracy theories. As financial support for Ukraine is something supported by both the center-left and center-right establishment, certain people on the fringes will naturally be skeptical. As an aside, I think the invasion of Iraq (and to a lesser extent Afghanistan) really damaged the credibility of US foreign policy institutions (think CIA, DoD, and associated think tanks/individuals) in a way that they haven't quite recovered from.
3. I think support for NATO is also more divided along fringe/centrist lines as opposed to party lines. Trump's presidency did weird things here, like make the right softer on Russia and likely add more conservatives to the anti-NATO camp (though to be clear most congressmen on the center-right still support NATO). 
4. To your last question, I think some of this is recasting the war in Ukraine as a ""proxy war"" between the US and Russia, in a way that removes moral responsibility for the war from Russia and presents the US and Russia as approximately equally culpable. I'm not sure how much of this is actually done in good faith..."
141,"How is having Christmas as a national holiday, not a violation of the establishment clause?","It looks a lot less like an endorsement if you think about it in terms of accommodating free expression of religion (which is also in the 1A).

It's not a ""national holiday"" but rather a day that the federal government, as an employer, is closed for business. If you're going to lose a critical mass of your workforce due to most of them taking annual leave to observe a holiday, perhaps it's easier to simply close for business than run on a skeleton crew. 

I grew up in a public school district that was Jewish enough that we were off for Yom Kippur, for example. No point in having class if half the kids aren't there for it."
142,Is it plausible that Africa/the African Union will get a single currency,"The African people is extremely divided culturally and, unlike the EU where many of its members are in good relations, there are many much more drastic conflicts in Africa 

Likewise Africa isn’t a prosperous place to start with and has more stuff to worry about instead of starting its own currency: war, humanitarian and economic crisis, massive shortages, just to name a few…

Impossible? No, nothing is impossible. Highly unlikely?  Yes, it might be a thing in the distant future, but for now…"
143,was it legal for the scotus to pause lifting title 42?,"There are two competing lawsuits.

During the Trump administration, a lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups saying that the implementation of Title 42 violated the rights of asylum seekers, and that the Trump administration had not convincingly proved there was a health risked posed by said asylum seekers. When the Biden administration announced plans to repeal the rule, Republican-led states filed their own lawsuit, saying the Biden administration had not properly allowed for notice-and-comment, and that the states would have objected to the repeal of the policy due to the likely increase of immigration increase a repeal would have.

One panel [ruled in favour of the ACLU and other groups](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/16/title-42-migrants-court-ruling/), another judge [ruled in favour of the Republican states](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/20/title-42-border-judge-ruling-migrants/). It is up to SCOTUS to adjudicate these competing claims and potentially answer all of the legal questions at hand (was Title 42 really in the interest of public health, were the proper procedures followed by the Biden administration, etc.)."

Now you can't stop Nazis liking certain things, whether its Punk music, Metal, methamphetamines, Slavic imagery, etc, you can get groups of fans of these examples that do not tolerate Nazis at all, and then you can also get groups that do"
145,Has a Liberal Democratic state ever become extremely authoritarian?,"Maybe the French second republic. It was pretty liberal for the 1840s, but didn't last long until its own president overthrew the government."
146,Is there a general consensus on the accuracy and depth of Peter Zeihan's work and perspective on geopolitics?,"Never heard of him, he's basically non-existent in academia. He's got pretty strong commercial cred, tho. Working under Friedman and getting to publish with him is a big deal. The big draw here is that this gives him a strong background in the US military and intelligence realm. 

I watched some of his YT videos, was a positive first impression. His analysis of current issues is timely and seems factual (Hard to say, after a couple of videos). Smart guy, likely has access to information and certainties that mere mortals don't have. Seems like he has been moving away from the commercial sector, positioning himself in the ""creator"" and speaker space, which would explain why he's writing pop-science. Imo that's not a great sign, since he is choosing to go into a direction that is harder to monetize, but has far less competition. I think someone with his background would have had more teeth, by being active in both realms, but it's hard to be trusted while being a public communicator. Ultimately, it really depends on his network, but his former collogues aren't the type to give things away for free.

His content was probably aimed at military folks and other people who got to look behind the curtain, but aren't active anymore. Those people don't care much for careful consideration, like academia. He's casting a much wider net now. I can't know his motivations, he could have a genuine interest in informing people, but it's also a very relaxed position that would remain stable for a long time, without having to put in much work. Cynics would call it a retirement plan.  

If you already have a good selection of sources and you are willing to put in the effort, there are more direct ways and you probably won't be getting massive insights beyond military info, here. If you don't, I'd say he makes for a good gateway drug bc he's big picture and easy to understand. He's def US-centric, but I don't see much of an indication that he's a disinformation. Hard to gauge the accuracy, but in terms of depth, his career path is the next best thing is being inside of the Pentagon and much less problematic, legally. Just don't treat him as a crystal ball, no analyst is. For example, he's pretty clearly lacking on the economic side of things. One reason to keep an eye on him, the quality of his sources will change dramatically with his influence."
147,What part of the Alberta Sovereignty Act is unconstitutional?,"I just did brief research on it, but the law potentially sets up a situation where Alberta refuses to abide by a valid federal law.

In federal systems, the key is a clear division of power between the federal government and anything within it. In this case, the Canadian federal government and the provincial governments. This Alberta law vaguely grants powers to the province to ignore a law that might damage its economy (for example) even if the federal law is perfectly within its scope to pass."
148,What will Kyrsten Sinema’s switch to Independent mean in 2024?,"It won’t.

For one, everyone saying this will “split the vote” has to remember that she can’t just hop on the ballot in Arizona as an independent. She would first need 42,000 signatures from independent voters, meaning they can’t be registered Democrat or Republican and that would be REALLY hard to get done without efficient campaign infrastructure that she doesn’t currently have without the Dems. And it would put a huge dent in whatever campaign funds she’ll have on hand. It’s moot anyways. 

She knows that she has no chances of winning Arizona as an independent or democrat. She’s doing this because she wants to be the center of attention and have the media discussing if she’s going to run or not while she heads to a nice corporate job after her term expires."
149,"How are preambulatory clauses of treaties and resolutions generally ordered?

150,How to get into political commentary?,"I just want to make sure we're on the same page here; political commentary is not a full time job, it's a hobby. Or, I should say, it's only a full time job for a couple hundred people in the United States. I'm reminded of [this scene from Seinfeld where George is trying to decide on a new career and suggests becoming a baseball color man](https://youtu.be/2LCggmsCXk4?t=40). Basically, it's not impossible to make a career out of it, it's just nearly impossibly difficult. The only people who really succeed there are prominent former politicians or prominent journalists.

I do this as a hobbyist. If you're okay with this not being a career, like if you just want to do it for fun or because you think you're doing something good for your community, here was my path:

Unpaid campaign volunteer, unpaid campaign manager, paid campaign manager, volunteer writer for local political blog, volunteer on my party's central committee, higher profile campaign manager... that's when people started to notice me and local papers started reaching out for me for comments. I ended up co-hosting a podcast and later a Saturday morning radio show, both of which were still unpaid volunteer positions.

As a political consultant, I made barely enough money to pay my rent. As a commentator I have never made more than the occasional free lunch. That being said, I wouldn't change it for the world. I just want to make sure you know what it looks like."

He's basically said he doesn't feel that $15 is a ""reasonable"" figure. Is that ""legitimate?"" Well, Manchin seems to think so, but there's hardly an objective answer here. Studying the effects of raising the minimum wage is a frustratingly hard thing to do, and at a certain point you kind of have to pick what information you think is relevant and what isn't."
152,"Fukuyama describes the ""End of History"" which (as a layperson) I understand to be a reference to Marx's view on history occurring through class struggle. Is this right? Has there been a credible response to Fukuyama that also accurately grasped his argument? What is it?","The idea is liberal capitalist democracy is the form of government towards which all states will naturally converge.

This isn’t really the end for Fukuyama though. The last chapter of The End of History, “The Last Man” (and the title of his next book, “The End of History and The Last Man”) is a reference to Nietzsche’s [The Last Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man) a kind of anti-Ubermench who becomes afflicted with nihilism in a materially abundant technocratic society. He sees this “end of history” leading to a great spiritual restlessness and dissatisfaction.

Quite a lot of people have criticized Fukuyama since the 1990s. I think the strongest criticism is showing how capitalism in China and Russia did not lead inevitably towards democracy — perhaps it had the opposite affect, where too much of an emphasis on free market capitalism worked against democratic progress.

But Fukuyama has become much less neoconservative and much more socialist over the years. His conception of liberal democracy in his latest book, Liberalism and it’s Discontents, fits more with the worldview of Corbyn and Sanders than Friedman and Rumsfeld. 

I think a lot of the current leftist critiques of Fukuyama come from misunderstandings. Yes, capitalism perhaps led China and Russia away from Democracy, but I think most leftists would argue this has made them less stable countries, and they would be better served by being more democratic and more socialist (in Fukuyama’s terminology, more classically liberal and less neoliberal.)"
153,"Why do so many populist leaders have an air of corruption about them, and why do so many people love them for it?",Because populism distrusts mainstream. Its inherent in populist ideology that the status quo and its legitimate institutions are inherently illegitimate. Therefore a “corrupt” individual is simply acting out in an already corrupt regime or society.
154,What is the current historical assessment of the accuracy of Karl Marx's theories in light of political developments since his passing?,"‘The current historical assessment’ will be highly politicized depending on who does the assessing (as I’m sure you know).  That said, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is an ok place to start when beginning new research:

155,"Fukuyama used the term Modernization Without Development to describe Southern Italy and Greece, but I don't think I really grasp his meaning. Help please!","Hey! It has been a few years since reading Political Order and Political Decay, but I will attempt a response surrounding what he is describing.  

When Fukuyama discusses the formation of the modern state, he is describing the move from tribal-level societies to formation of state and evolution from Patrimonial State to Modern States. In the development of the Modern State the concept of National Development is employed. This encompasses three pillars, per say, that can occur by themselves but shouldn’t for the optimal development to occur: Economic Growth, Social Mobilization, and Political Development. Fukuyama measures historical economic growth based on the industrialization of a society. With industrialization, there should be an increase in entrepreneurship, income, and industrial output. These increases ideally increase Social Mobilization, or the participation in a joint interest of ideology. Within Political Development there are three additional subgroups: State Building, Rule of Law, and Accountability. All of which develop individually over time. Roughly, his theory states that economic growth increases social mobilization, leading to more political participation. To restrict the state from suffering from political decay, there also needs to be Political Development in the subgroup areas that coincides with increases in either economic growth or social mobilization.

Italy developed its current multi-party parliamentary republic after the ‘fall of fascism’. In the implementation of this electoral system, there was an immediate increase in social mobilization of the population. This is the “Modernization” of the political structure. Now focusing on Southern Italy and clientelism: there was increase in the economic investment by the state. The goal of the state was to utilize the modernized political system to industrialize the economy via the disbursement of state funds based on the needs of the localities articulated by the elected officials who now represent the population. Intended Goal: Political Development -> Social Mobilization -> Economic Growth -> Political development, etc. a positive feedback loop. However, due to clientelism and patronage, personal interests and personal relationships were prioritized over the will of the population participating in the political system, and all the benefits of economic growth and social mobilization were restricted by the lack of political development in the areas of accountability and rule of law.  Southern Italy experienced economic growth, without the positive increases in income, entrepreneurship, or economic output. Southern Italy saw increased social mobilization through participation in elections and representation at a national level without increasing the participation in a joint interest of ideology. Southern Italy modernized its political and economic system, but did not develop the political structures necessary for optional National Development, thus, Southern Italy experienced “Modernization Without Development”.

I hope this helps, was fun to engage in this, and I am happy to talk further."
156,Could Congress have forced the railroad companies to give paid medical leave?,"Virtually every piece of legislation requires 60 votes to get through the Senate (with a few exceptions for reconciliation bills, which wouldn't apply here). Yes, Congress *can* pass a bill requiring all rail workers get paid sick leave. However, it would require 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass. In fact, they did try to do this. Concurrent with the bill breaking the expected strike was a bill guaranteeing paid sick leave, but it failed in the Senate."
157,How can Biden signing a bill stop a railroad strike?,"[This article](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/weve-probably-averted-a-rail-strike-now-what#:~:text=It's%20pretty%20likely%20that%20the,But%20it%20would%20be%20illegal) answers that question for you. Because Congress has the authority under the Railway Labor Act to enforce an agreement, once Biden signed the legislation into law, it becomes binding. Workers can indeed still strike if they wanted to, but it would then be considered illegal, and the railway companies would quickly get the courts to enforce the law. As the article notes, unions could face major fines if they went ahead with a strike, and workers could lose their jobs.

The article also notes that this is similar to the air traffic controller strike in the 1980s, when Reagan fired all striking controllers and barred them from ever coming back. Once a strike becomes illegal, workers and unions can pay a serious price if they go ahead with a strike anyway."
158,Why does Russia have a history of its rulers hoarding power?,"Inequality and autocracy are not exclusive to Russia, nor was that fate pre-ordained for Russia. You might recall the most evil regimes in European history eventually yielded to peaceable democratic ones, despite the continent's long history with monarchism and despotism.

Had the Liberator not been assassinated (motivating his son and successor to the path of illiberal and authoritarian rule), had the Bolsheviks respected democratic order, had the Allied intervention in the civil war been more competent or successful, had Yeltsin not chosen Putin, had Putin not liquidated liberal opposition... these are all choices, made by actors competing against opposition who managed to succeed.

The Soviet Union was the last great extractive colonial empire, which partially explains its brutal, imperial nature. Putin's Russia is much like any autocratic rentier state, like Angola, Azerbaijan, or Saudi Arabia."

160,Why is multiculturalism so popular in western Europe?,"There are four aspects concerning this subject I'd like to highlight:

The first aspect is that 'they' (certain migrant groups) are here (western Europe), because we were there (Asia, Africa, the Americas) in colonial times. As a consequence of colonial empires, people from there migrated to the specific mother country that ruled these areas. That can be because of certain citizenship rights, the relevant language skills, or just previous family contacts. You can see which places were ruled by which mother country by looking at the origins of the (larger) migrant groups. The colonial experience overseas also sets west European countries apart from east European countries, who lack this history.

The second aspect is labour migration. After World War II western Europeans needed a lot of labour for reconstruction and economic growth. At first they looked to southern European countries for labour migration, later to elsewhere in the world. These people were often invited, but not necessarily expected to stay for the longer term. People from the second or third generation sometimes found themselves to be second class citizens in a country they were born in.

The third aspect is that multiculturalism was/is not always seen as positive, yet the experience of World War II and memory of the crimes of the Nazis made any criticism of foreign immigration rather taboo. From the 1980s onward however right-wing populists have mobilised nativism in the native population and heavily criticized 'political correctness' on the subject of multiculturalism. So popularity is not a given.

The last aspect is that east European countries had a lot of multiculturalism up to World War I in various multinational empires. But their main lessons of WW I and II has been that  mononational/monocultural nation-states are necessary to avoid war, as any ethnic minority within your borders could lead to aggression from a neighbouring state. Ethnic cleansing and deportations during and after the world wars led to suddenly very homogeneous populations in these countries afterwards. The experiences of Communist dictatorships also caused people to treasure their national identity and monoculture, although there was some migration within the Communist bloc, for example with Vietnamese moving to Czechoslovakia. 

I hope this explains some of the differences in stances towards multiculturalism in (very) broad strokes."
161,What happens if there is not enough votes for a speaker of the house when a new congress starts?,"The Speaker of the House is mentioned in both the Constitution and various federal statutes. Generally, if a speaker's not able to be elected the House will hold as many rounds of voting as it needs to until the Speaker is chosen. In extreme cases it can take literal weeks of voting to choose a speaker."
162,Why is being a speaker important? What power does it have? Why are they against the current speaker?,"Looking just at the Constitution, the Speaker is basically the ""face"" or the leader of the House. It's similar to the President pro Tempore of the Senate in that the Speaker is the official spokesperson of the House. This role always had a bit more power than the Senate counterpart because the House, as the popularly elected body, was always supposed to have a bit more power than the Senate, but overall, the comparisons are very similar.

However, that's only a part of the story. The Constitution is very light on the specific rules for how the House operates--who has committee appointments, what committees there are, when debate is opened, when debate is closed, when votes happen, etc. This is a good thing in many ways, but ultimately the Constitution delegates these rules to the Speaker to create and enforce. And when Newt Gingrich was the Speaker, he enacted a bunch of rules changes that essentially gives the Speaker almost total control over those sorts of things.

This means that ""winning the House"" matters because what the House does is determined almost entirely by the Speaker. The Speaker is elected by a majority vote of all members of the House, so especially since the days of Gingrich, the party that wins the majority almost always has their most obvious leader become speaker, and that party then controls a lot of what happens in the House.

So why is this time different? Well, the Reps undershot expectations by quite a bit. The Reps by their own benchmarks needed a red wave to have a successful election season, and they most definitely did not have that. This means two things: 1) there are some folks looking for heads to roll after such a poor performance, and 2) the Reps need almost every vote they have to put *anybody* in speakership over Dem objection so the room for error is very small.

McCarthy was the clear leader of House Reps before the drastically bad election, so some folks are attempting to blame him. The interesting thing from this is that the clearest losers in the Reps were the MAGA-est parts of the party, and most of Trump's key supporters in the House such as MTG or Jim Jordan are backing McCarthy. It's mostly the Freedom Caucus that is pushing back against his speakership...and boosting one of their own.

Essentially, it appears that some folks who want to take a greater role in the party smell blood in the water and are hoping to pounce on McCarthy's weakness. Right now, after leading the party to such a shockingly bad election, McCarthy is probably at his weakest, and if anyone else has designs to elevate themselves to a position of party leadership in the House, now would be a decent time to do it. Ultimately, this all may be a bit overblown--it's not all that clear that McCarthy will fail to win and in the end the Reps don't really have an obvious candidate to take over. But this is just more evidence that the election didn't really go the way the Reps were hoping and that their leadership is struggling a bit to lead effectively."
163,What happens if the Republicans in US House of Representatives cannot agree on a candidate for speaker?,"They vote again and again and again until a majority of *everyone* agrees. It's non-partisan in actuality. Also they can vote simply 'present' instead of for a candidate, and it's included in the vote totals. So attendance is important. There is precedent. There was a session a hundred years ago where it was months and many, many rounds of voting before the whole House agreed in majority, regardless of party. I don't have the resources, but this is well defined. And, there were articles discussing the scope of it after the 2016 election when the leading candidate then as now faced the prospect of a slim majority."
164,What are the advantages and downsides to a country’s administrative capital being the same as its economic capital?,"Although I haven't done any research, I suspect that in the centuries of early capitalism it was much more common for companies to be based in their country's capital city.

Companies are larger and more powerful than the usual shops and merchants of the medieval period, which brings them into greater contact with the government (as a client, regulator or rival). When jockeying for power alongside the monarchy, the aristocracy and other capitalists, it would've made sense to simply set up your headquarters as near the palace or parliament as possible. When time is money, you can't afford to spend days getting from Lancaster to London by carriage every time you need royal approval for a new trading colony.

The concern with transportation to the capital is probably only outdone by the concern of transportation to where your buyers are. Ignoring the fact that it was the American capital for a brief moment in history, New York famously became a trade and financial hub because of its location relative to the Hudson River. Amsterdam likely prospered because of its river access. As transportation became easier and more ambitious in the 19th and 20th, commerce became less fixated around the capitals and more fixated around the ports and waterways (case in point: the Strait of Hormuz)."
165,"In the USA, who gets house majority if there is a tie (presumably from a vacancy)?","I think there would not be a majority leader until the seat is filled. If there is a tie in the house, the bill dies.  No tie breaking."
166,Why have Palestine's neighboring Arab countries not offered more support to Palestinian refugees? Why were Palestinian refugees unable to assimilate into neighboring Arab countries?,"Couple of reasons. I'm going to be a bit broad because otherwise it's a book and I don't write books for free. I do also want to look at the issue in terms of realpolitik - I am an ardent supporter of Palestine and I'm deeply disgusted with the actions of the state of Israel but the world of politics operates more on practical realities than on what's morally right more often than it doesn't.

For starters, Palestinian refugees just aren't these states' problem. The issue is being created by Israel's expulsionist policies so many of these states don't see why they should have to clean up after Israel and serve Israeli interests by giving Palestinians a place to go. Israel *wants* Palestinians to leave. Laying out the welcome mat is helping Israel do that.

These states figure why should they *help* Israel do something that *they* then have to pay for? Especially when their relationship with Israel isn't exactly cooperative to begin with.

Furthermore, refugees are expensive to help. Especially when you're talking about tens of thousands of them, they need a lot of things and those things have to come from somewhere. Lebanon is suffering from crushing economic problems, Egypt has had a series of political blow-ups and isn't exactly swimming in cash, Jordan is in better(ish) shape but their economy isn't massive and they're also dealing with an influx of refugees from Syria and the ongoing conflict there. Syria is in the middle of a civil war, not exactly in a position to help.

Cyprus is an option (if you could get past the blockades) but they're not exactly booming either. Also, as I understand it, they're not the most welcoming place for refugees.

So it's not like there's a wide range of options for places to go if someone were to want to flee the country.

That's kinda the long and the short of it. There's this perception that Palestinians have places to go if they wanted to when they actually really don't. Even if they could get into somewhere that wasn't immediately on the border, most regional powers are not up to offering the kind of support that a large influx of refugees would require. Saudi Arabia *maybe* but they're not eager to take on a large population of refugees that don't really have anything to offer economically and will need a lot of support for some time to come."
167,There are more Democrats than Republicans in the US. Why wouldn't Democrats plan a strategic takeover of sparsely populated states to have long term control of government institutions?,"Let me answer your question with another question. How would you do that?

These are people we're talking about, not members of some political party that would uproot their entire lives just to win a couple more seats that aren't even guaranteed. 

Even if you were passionate about some cause that a particular party aligns with, would *you* make that move? To Utah, Nebraska, Arkansas? And that's just on an individual level. Corporations move based off of their own interests such as economic climate, tax breaks, existing demographics (if say, google, moved their global headquarters to salt lake city, would they even be able to find workers to fill out their ranks?)

There's simply too many factors that go into your question that quite frankly don't make sense and conflate political parties with this all powerful organization when really they're not"
168,can nation A give/lease some of it's own territory to nation B to stymie nation C from invading A (now including Nation B new territory)?,"Yes. This is how Germany took over Poland in WWII. Poland agreed to let Germany lay down train tracks to further the effort against the Soviets.

But then - surprise! Poland is Germany's now. Terrible double cross."
169,Why are democrats still worried about Manchin or Sinema obstructing their agenda when the GOP is likely to block them with a house majority?,"Appointments can be very important, especially judicial appointments."
170,What is the difference between Bidens approach of using the Executive branch for meaningful impact and FDR's use of the Executive branch?,"Build Back Better was stripped down because Biden's support in Congress is shaky. Student Loan Forgiveness lacked support in Congress and trying to make an allocation of that size purely on executive authority was never realistically going to survive Court scrutiny - the question wasn't whether it would be blocked but what legal arguments would be made to block it.

In contrast, FDR had a friendly Congress so he was able to get his agenda passed in the legislature."
171,"If the House splits 218-217 but then as one or more Congresspersons die or leave office over the next 2 years, resulting in one party becoming the majority, is it possible the Speaker of the House and committee chairs may flip flop several times before the next election?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/ysn6bo/what_happens_if_control_of_the_house_changes/
172,A Canadian asks if the Libertarian Party could ever become a strong 3rd party?,"A serious party might have a chance,  but the Libertarian party is just a grift.

Running for President with no government experience or other governmental representation seems downright delusional."
173,Why does Nevada take so long to count votes?,"> Literally almost every other state does not have that issue.

Well, to begin with, that isn't true. There are lots of other states that have this issue--California, for example, which has the most voters by far, can sometimes take weeks to count. Alaska builds in extra time after election day to make sure absentee ballots can travel long distances. But their state-wide elections are rarely competitive enough that those races can't be called early. Nevada's problem is that it's a competitive state.

[This article](https://archive.ph/Ty13U) goes deeper into Nevada-specific problems, but the short answer is that Nevada accepts mail-in ballots for several days after the election, as long as they were postmarked by election day. During the pandemic, the state changed their laws to require mail-in ballots sent to every registered voter. This has meant a big rise in mail-in ballots to be processed, without necessarily an increase in the ability to process those ballots."
174,Does land belong to the country it's in or to the private company/person who owns it?,"Both. The owner has ownership. The country where it’s located has sovereignty. Depending on the context, either could be described as “the land belongs to X.” If you’re talking about international relations, you’d say the land belongs to the country (as opposed to belonging to some other country). If you’re talking about getting permission to go camping, you’d say it belongs to the owner."
175,What is the background on the Trump-DeSantis beef?,Trump is expected to announce his candidacy imminently.
176,ELI5,"Pretend you want to start a business. Obviously if you want to grow it, you need to hire other people. If there are no unemployed people, then your only option to hire is to ""take/steal"" an employee from someone else. In order to do so, you offer that employee more money than they were currently making (for example, if they were making $15/hour, you offer them $17/hour). Once that employee leaves, that employer is in the same boat and must steal a different employee. So the low unemployment has two significant impacts from this perspective; that there aren't enough employees to grow your economy, and wages will have to rise quickly as employees jump from business to business. 

Generally, a national unemployment rate of ~4-5% is great. When it drops below 4%, you start having issues finding workers, meaning the economy can't grow as quickly as it wants."
177,What Happens If Control Of The House Changes DURING The Session?,">As this is completely unprecedented: what would happen?

Nothing crazy. The new reigning party would force new elections for a Speaker of the House and likely elect someone from their party. Then life would resume with the other party controlling the House."
178,What are some alternate districting methods to combat gerrymandering? And should it come from the Federal Govt?,"How much have you search already?  This topic has been covered on the internet many times in various sources, and i'ts unclear what you've already found from googling.  There are lots of ways to change the redistricting process to be fairer.  There's plenty of computer and other methods to divide districts; as well as metrics to measure how distorting a particular setup is.
Note that most districts are equal population already, as that's fairly easy to enforce, and you can still have a lot of distortions even with equal population.

Generally, most fixes are about adjusting who decides the redistricting.  As there's lots of subtle ways to influence a result; so you want the deciding group to be one less interested in partisan concerns.


Though really, what's most effective would be to switch to a proportional system, or some other system that is inherently immune to gerrymandering."
179,What happens if a senator swaps sides ahead of term's end?,"He would remain a Senator. He would leave the GOP caucus in the Senate and join the Democratic caucus in the Senate. He would also need to switch financial support from the RNC to the DNC.

180,After the mid-terms are there any indications the DOJ will move forward with Trump Indictment,"Since the Georgia election is heading to a runoff, it's unlikely the DoJ does anything before mid-December when that is finished, which means if they do anything it isn't likely to happen until January 2023 at the earliest. 

There is no additional indication that the DoJ is going to move to indict Trump other than what we saw in August/September. The only relevant leaks we've seen is the DoJ is considering appointing a special counsel to oversee these investigations if Trump announces his candidacy for 2024.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/doj-trump-investigation-expansion-special-counsel/index.html

But that doesn't mean they'd charge him (much like Mueller and the DoJ didn't charge Trump in 2019), but they just want an ""independent"" in charge of the investigation."
181,What Makes the 2022 US Midterm Election Special?,"Basically, everyone expected Republicans to have a massive victory; instead, they lost the senate and will only win the house by a very narrow margin. 

Midterm elections are elections that take place two years after the presidential election, and historically, the President's party does extremely poorly. In 2018 the Republicans lost 41 seats in the House; in 2010, the Democrats lost 61 seats in the house. Combine that with 40 years of high inflation and Biden's approval ratings being the lowest of any post-war President going into the midterms, even with Republicans squeaking by in the House (which they probably will); this is the best result for a President's party in a midterm since 2004."
182,So...What happens now with Harper v Moore now?,"As far as I know, nothing, because it is a judicial dispute over state action, and the midterm federal elections don't affect anything about the case."
183,What is the path to online realtime elections using the internet?,"> Effectively everybody has access to the internet

Well, first of all, this is not true--at least if you're talking about the US. Slightly over 90% of the US has access to the internet. There are still rural parts of the country where internet access is hard to come by, and plenty of rural/older voters who don't think it's worth it.

But the bigger problem with internet elections isn't the access, and it isn't the technology. The technology exists. Other countries, like Estonia, use it. It's that Americans don't have faith in it.

The US has a long history of (very real) voter suppression in, for example, the Jim Crow South. In recent years, the Republican Party's insistence on pushing widespread ""voter fraud"" conspiracy theories has vastly diminished trust in our election results--both on the part of Republican voters who believe these theories, and Democratic voters who believe these kinds of theories are a cover for the Republicans' own malfeasance. Add in the fact that we know Russia and other antagonistic countries are using the internet to try and influence our election results--and that they've hacked into our voting systems in the past--and it gets very hard to see how you get Americans to have faith in this kind of voting system. We like to see the paper trail. We like that that our voting system is so decentralized, because that means you at least have to physically in the room to mess with the results."
184,Are all US senate and house elections determined by state populist vote?,"Senators, Governors, and some judges are elected en masse by the entire population of the state, most often by a first-past-the-post majority, though at least one state (I suspect a handful of others but don't know of the top of my head) has ranked choice voting for some state positions.

Members of the House of Representatives are only elected by residents in their districts, rather than the state at large."
185,Has Biden done any pocket vetoes?,"The Congress has had a Democratic majority, so there has not been any legislation Biden has wanted to veto."
186,How is it that that determining who controls house/senate after elections always comes down to the last 1-2 states to report their results?,"Well, it's just that the elections lately have truly been close. If one party blew the other party out, then it would be clear earlier on, but when the majorities in both Houses will be determined by possibly as few as one or two seats, then of course we have to wait until the last one or two seats are counted to know for sure who wins."
187,"Is it accurate to use ""Congress"" to refer to just the House of Representatives alone, as some often do?","Yes it's erroneous and likely the person misspoke. Congress always refers to both chambers, and not just the House."
188,"Are there key races, that should be decided relatively early, that will give clue to how each party is doing nationally in the US election today? If so which ones should be watched?","I would recommend taking a look at [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com) tonight to best answer this question. They have a liveblog going on, and unlike most media coverage of the night, 538 does a good job avoiding partisan hot takes and other really stupid takes. They've already talked a bit about some this question.

But overall, the concept of certain races being ""turning points"" in the night is a bit overblown. The bottom line is that one race going well doesn't mean another will or won't. Just look at 2020, where the Dems had some weird underperformances in the Senate races in Maine and North Carolina, some right on like in Arizona, and some odd overperformances like in Georgia.

Looking at close races is actually not even a very good way to answer this question. For example, in PA and GA we've got races that could go either way. This means that just a very slight underperformance for either side could result in a widely different outcome, and such minor variations may not actually signal much. But also, because we're at 50/50 in the Senate, you could see the night mostly go according to plan for both sides and still see a major shift in the status quo.

In a lot of ways, the best way to answer this question is to look at the margin and measure the under or overperformance there. For example, on the 538 chat they've noticed that there is a 7 point gap between Warnock and Abrams, despite both sharing the same ballots, which is entirely consistent with the polling. Similarly, they're closely watching the abortion ballot measure in KY.

But if you're just looking for a very simple ""what is the best indicator of who will control the Senate or House?"" then you should try and see which races have the closest margins and see if they go the way they are ""supposed"" to. Looking up the 538 election forecast would give you enough to determine that on your own, and obviously if the two closest Senate races (PA and GA) are determined early...then that's probably a pretty good indicator.

190,Does New York count mail in ballots the day after the election or will we know the winner on the same night?,"Many, I would say most, states count mail in ballots before the election but keep results internally only releasing them at the same time the other results are made public. Processing mail in ballots takes more time so it's prudent to not wait till polls close if you want timely results."
191,"What are the roles of the lesser known titles on the ballots, and why do they need to be elected/partisan?","Secretaries of state oversee elections and work with local elections offices. Treasurers run the financial departments of their states, collecting taxes and doing budget work. Attorneys general are the states' top lawyers, in charge of state law enforcement and state prosecutors. Comptrollers I believe are kinda like treasurers but are usually at the city level.

While the federal government does a lot of governing, states do probably more governing. That makes state positions very powerful/important, so it's worth doing a little research on each of the candidates before you vote (check the voter's pamphlet). In Oregon for example, the governor, treasurer and secretary of state make decisions together on state timber sales (where to cut, how much to cut)."

Mubarak, same thing, he resigned, ceding power to an interim government (which was the army).

No, it was intervention on the cheap. [Former President Obama called Libya his worst mistake](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/barack-obama-says-libya-was-worst-mistake-of-his-presidency) in that the Western bloc failed to adequately plan for what would come after the collapse of the Gaddafi regime."
194,Why does it take so long for special elections to be held?,">Surely it defeats the purpose waiting to hold them the same day as the general election just to fill the seat for two months?

The 17th amendment to the Constitution (passed 1912) says:

>When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.

So the Constitution says vacancies in the Senate are filled by the ""executive"" (AKA governor) until the state holds elections. Elections are very expensive, so it would cost tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions) of dollars to hold an election just for one seat. So most states just wait until the next planned election to vote for that vacancy. So for your examples on Senators:

**Kamala Harris** was up for re-election in 2022. The governor of California chose Alex Padilla to serve the remainder of her term (January 2021- January 2023) and let the people vote in the next general election.

**John McCain** was elected in 2016. He died in August 2018. Due to how close this was to the general election in November 2018, The governor appointed Jon Kyl to the seat to fill until the next reasonable general election in November 2020. Jon Kyl resigned in December 2018, so Martha McSally was appointed to replace her until the general election of 2020, where she lost to Mark Kelly who will serve through 2022 when John McCain's seat originally expired.

Now for the House of Representatives, the Constitution says replacement MUST be elected, so nobody can appoint temporary replacements. So it's really up to the state to determine whether they want to spend the money/time to hold a special election for 1 seat, or wait for the next general election. In this case, Florida decided to hold the primaries for the seat with the general election in 2021, then the general election 2 months later in January."
195,"When a person is elected at the State level, does their party affiliation contribute to power dynamics at the Federal level or is that only for specific offices?","The answer here is nuanced. Of course state level stuff does factor into the national policy positions. Folks often get it backwards, but party platforms are determined based on what voters want to see. It's very hard for politicians to get voters to care about something they don't want to care about. It's very easy for voters to get politicians to care about something they didn't care about before. And obviously this grassroots perspective has go from voter->local organization->state organization->national organization.

But is it formulaic? Of course not. There's no mathematical equation here that perfectly explains how much influence is there. Some state level politicians are only state level politicians because frankly they're not talented enough to be more than that. Those folks may not always be able to have as much influence as someone else. But also the most talented state level folks tend to move up to federal office.

In short, broadly, yes, of course, lower level party folks do contribute to the national platform. A national candidate cannot afford to disregard the state level stuff happening, certainly. But is there a clearly precise amount this can be measured? Not really."
196,"When SCOTUS said that the right to an abortion is not protected by the constitution, does that create problems with other issues not spelled out in the constitution?","In Roe v. Wade, a national right to abortion was established through a specific legal concept called substantive due process. This is the legal concept that was discussed and rejected for abortion in Dobbs. It would be reasonable for someone to apply the Dobbs precedent to other substantive due process rights, yes, but it would not really make sense to apply that precedent to anything else.

You're basically oversimplifying. It wasn't that abortion was overturned because it's not in the Constitution. It's overturned because the Court rejected the premises of substantive due process which protects rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. 

So no, you could not use Dobbs to justify secession, but you could use it to justify taking away federal protections on interracial marriage, for example."
197,How long did we know bin Laden was in Pakistan?,The general public won't know until the relevant documents get declassified.
198,"As SCOTUS cancels race based college admission, is there likely to be any impact on high school elementary school policies?","Probably not.

First of all, in CA, affirmative action is already illegal (for public schools). So nothing happening in the Bay Area has anything to do with affirmative action.

If this was not in CA, then still no.

Canceling a test-based admissions program and replacing it with a lottery (as happened at Lowell) eliminates all forms of discrimination (positive, negative, or otherwise) from admissions. A test-based admissions system intentionally discriminates on the basis of test scores; that's what it is designed to do.

It might be easier to make an argument about a budget decision favoring one group over another (that's what canceling advanced math is. It's a decision to fund some other program instead), but the politics of that would look really bad (you would have to argue that advanced math courses inherently benefit white and Asian students), and implementing a ruling like that would be impossible. Every budget ever made favors some group over another. If anything that incidentally benefits one racial group can be budgeted for, nothing can be budgeted for."
199,Is it possible to be chief of staff and press secretary at the same time?,"Is it constitutionally / legally possible?

Sure - these are positions created in offices (whether it's the President's or Congressional or whatever) is able to change and hire to/from as needed. 

Functionally is it possible?

Probably not. In major offices, like the White House or big Senate offices, they're both full-time jobs (arguably both actually requiring more time than the average full-time job). And have some overlapping but ultimately pretty different skill sets.

That being said, yes sometimes in smaller offices or teams - you'll have the Chief of Staff double-hatting in another capacity (though unlikely the Press Secretary - while the Press Secretary is often the most visible member of the communications teams, it's actually usually the Communications Director in most offices that is the most senior comms staff - though obviously again, in very small teams, it's often the same person)"
200,Who is Nancy Pelosi’s Republican challenger?,"She is running against John Dennis.

https://www.johndennisforcongress.com/

In the nonpartisan primary, Nancy Pelosi got >70% of the vote and John Dennis got 10.7% of the vote, barely edging out another Democrat with 10.4% of the vote to make it into the general election. So there's not really a chance for Dennis to win."
201,Is there proof about what volunteer or other actions help influence election outcomes?,"I think what works are GOTV efforts. Get out the vote. These can be small or large scale, but these efforts make the most difference. 

Get your friends and family to vote. Help them get to the polls. Help them know where to go. Getting five people to the polls works more than making Radom phone calls, in my opinion."
202,"What is the name of an ideology where instead of being one leader, it is a council of people based upon how many people voted for what party?","There isn't really a name because this doesn't really exist because it wouldn't work. What you're essentially describing is a PR legislature without any ministers, but that always decides everything as a group. That is a practically impossible application, so one has really named it."
203,"Does the U.S. Congress have the power ban ""general ticket"" voting in the Electoral College?","I don't think so.  Article II of the Constitution states:

> Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress[.]

While there is debate over the extent of the ""Legislature,"" the text seems to make clear that it is up to each state to decide how to allocate electors and that the federal government has no power whatsoever to change that.  (Which sort of answers your bonus question too, as long as the state specifies a method of appointment, it is by definition constitutional because the Constitution itself says a state can do whatever it wants, more or less [setting aside hypotheticals that would infringe on poll taxes and stuff])."
204,How did we get footage of the CCP public humiliation/ removal of Hu Jintao?,"Nothing done in the Chinese Communist Party is unscripted. By publicly removing Hu, Xi is indicating that all policies under Hu's watch can be revised and questioned. Imagine if they did this to Mao publicly. Would he still be venerated as the father of modern China today?  No, he would be seen as a pathetic figure, incompetent in the worst way. That is who Hu is painted to be from now on. 

Xi destroyed Hu's legacy among all eyes in China today.

Further, he understands the optics better than anyone. Under his approval, this footage was publicly released, so far as Western media was concerned.

The more nuanced question is what message was Xi signaling to the west, and to whom in particular?"
205,Can the power of the US presidential veto be messed with?,"To start, let's see what the Constitution says about vetoes. Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution:

>Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.

So when a bill is passed by Congress, the President has 10 days to veto the bill. If the President signs (or doesn't sign) the bill, it becomes law. The exception is if Congress goes on recess within the 10 days, so the President can't return the bill vetoed. This is called a ""pocket veto"" where the President doesn't sign the bill, but because Congress isn't present to receive a veto the bill fails to become law.

So looking at your scenarios:

>Like not directly sending a bill back to the congressional clerk’s office but instead tweeting out something critical of the bill within 10 days of it passing and then not signing it.

If Congress is in session during those 10 days, the bill becomes law unless the President explicitly ""returns it with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated"". So tweeting out something critical would likely fail to count as returning the bill to the Chamber of Congress in question. The DoJ under Trump has repeatedly argued that Presidential tweets are not taken as orders because they are not direct enough, so it's unlikely the government would change that stance.

>Or another example could be the president claiming they informed a member of congressional leadership on a phone call that they disapproved of the bill, but never put it in writing?

You're starting to get into grey territory, but courts would likely err on the side of tradition, and say failure to return the bill to the House in a physical form (as has always been done) would fail to meet the spirit of the Constitution and wouldn't count as a veto.

>Or on the flip side could congress create a requirement so onerous that a veto is effectively difficult, or impossible, to do? For example, by requiring that they be informed of the veto by the president showing up, in person, to deliver a 24 hour speech explaining their reasons for opposing the bill

So this is starting to get into a grey area, because courts generally don't get into political questions (known as the ""political doctrine"", where courts won't rule on issues that are very political like ""checks and balances"" questions). But if Congress attempted to stymie Presidential powers through excessive legislation, there's a good chance SCOTUS would rule with the President. Courts generally don't like one branch trying to railroad or strip powers from another branch when it's explicitly laid out in the Constitution."
206,Why did Russia let Wagner Group forces die in Syria?,"The mercenaries were part of a group that had been firing on Americans located in an agreed upon deconfliction zone. 

We have things like deconfliction zones so Russians and Americans don’t accidentally start firing at each other, creating an international incident between nuclear powers. We agree to stay in our zones and Russia agrees to stay in their zones.

So if official Russian forces were firing upon an American deconfliction zone, that could be seen as an act of war."
207,"If the U.S. House of Representatives had more members, and each state in the US had proportionally more Representative seats apportioned to them, would that make gerrymandering easier or harder?","It would be much harder. One reason that gerrymandering is so effective is that instead of just creating new districts when the population demands it, we ""reshuffle"" districts which involves moving around voters to different districts. If we just added districts as needed based on population growth, there's much less wholesale redrawing of lines and more marginal shifts as states grow and shrink. 

We might see some initial gerrymandering the first time we move from 8 seats to 13 or 14, but even then, it's a lot harder to get creative with the borders when your districts are smaller. If you've got fewer folks you're representing, it's harder to draw really confusing or complicated lines that are still somewhat compact."
208,"If Russia detonates nukes on its own soil, but the radiation flows over to NATO countries, will it invoke Article 5?","If i am not mistaken article 5 isnt invoked somehow, but has to be declared.

209,Can Congress Codify Gay Marriage And Strip SCOUS Jurisdiction Over Said Law?,"I think it's generally accepted that gay marriage can be codified at the federal level. The problem is finding the votes for it, as any such bill would be subject to the filibuster, requiring 60 votes. Considering the recent ""moral panic"" over grooming of children and ""sexualization and perversion"" of society among Republicans, it's unlikely you find 10 GOP senators to vote on. The House just passed a bill to codify same-sex marriage but is waiting until after midterms to vote, hoping once the election is passed they can find the GOP Senate support in the ""lame-duck"" portion of the Congress.

210,How do some politicians develop cult followings?,Democracy is hard. You have to educate yourself on the issues and the candidates for so many different offices.

212,"How could revelations about the Steele Dossier, and the Danchenko trial in particular, affect US politics?","> So this inquiry seems intended to discredit widely believed claims that Russian interests sought to influence the 2016 Election, possibly with Trump's tacit approval.

You could argue that intent was to muddy it, sure, but the intent by Russia to influence has already been proven. [The Mueller report](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download) shows instructions to Russian operatives to support Trump (and Senator Bernard Sanders), and the public has seen the back-channel communications between Russian officials and Donald Jr., and the intelligence assessments that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC and disseminating their private communications and strategic documents in a way intended to damage and influence. They paid for the adverts, they made the phone calls. That's all in the historical record already.

> Should it succeed, it will cast doubt on popular perceptions of Russian aims to influence world opinion in general, including support for the war in Ukraine, as well as much criticism of Trump e.g. claims that he is allied with and supports anti-Democratic organizations and leaders, such as Putin.

Although elements of the American right's media machine have been relentlessly pushing pro-Russia views since the war's beginning, these efforts have largely been ineffective. [Recent polling shows most Republicans still supporting Ukraine.](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vu1wawsnwb/econTabReport.pdf#page=14) I'm not sure how successfully prosecuting Danchenko changes the situation in favour of Russia or pro-Russia Republicans."
213,Are there Republicans (not in office) that want the student loan forgiveness?,"Most Republicans don't support student loan forgiveness. [This poll](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/voters-split-student-loan-forgiveness-new-poll-shows-rcna48490) puts the number at 11% in favour; [this poll](https://morningconsult.com/2022/08/31/biden-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-plan-survey/) shows two thirds of Republicans in opposition. I think the sentiment underpinning this tends to be that college graduates are not the most deserving group when it comes to federal assistance, as a college education is already in theory a net benefit regardless of cost, and the student entered the loan agreement willingly without coercion or duress.

Certainly some Republican voters will benefit from the plan, but the college-educated lean Democratic, and voters aren't hyper-rational automatons. Political beliefs are mostly emotional (if there were a single rational answer to an issue, that issue wouldn't be political)."
214,What is the current situation of China buying rare earth minerals in Africa and the America's and how are other countries reacting?,"For the most part, the rest of the world isn't reacting to it. China building trade with Africa is a natural extension of the peaceful economic activity.

Moreover, the more closely they tie their economy with places like Africa, the more confidence the rest of the world has that China will maintain a peaceful posture in the world since losing those economic links would cause hardship in China itself - and it would be impossible for China to maintain such ties in the face of an ongoing conflict."
215,"On US political system, what's the difference between minor parties and being independent?",">Are minor parties 100% parties?

Yes

>If so, why is the US considered a two-party system?

The electoral systems in vast majority of the US make it extremely difficult for minor parties or independents to succeed therefore the default is that the 2 current major parties are the only viable options.

>Just because those smaller parties don't have enough support, or are there other reasons?

It's difficult to gain support with restrictive electoral systems and finance laws that allow those major parties to have far more resources to develop policy, communicate with people and retain a presence.

> What's the difference between minor parties and being an independent 

The difference between a minor party and an independent is that a minor party is a party, likely with values and policies and candidates advocate for those policies with the support of the party. Parties are useful for pulling reosurces together. An independent isn't affiliated, at least directly, to any party. They don't have a party behind them, they often have organisations and/or community groups which are in support of them."
216,Is the US today an empire or hegemonic,"Going by definitions alone, clearly a hegemony. 

I don't really agree with the dichotomy you present here since a hegemony doesn't necessarily have to be soft power.   Something can be an empire *and* a hegemony, and historical empires often were. The Roman Empire exercised hegemony over its subjects and allies.

The US is not an empire pure and simple. There may be some confusion over the term because people metaphorically compare it to empires, especially to draw a parallel to the British Empire the US once fought against only to become an ""empire"" of its own. It's imperialistic but not really an empire. But like the Roman Empire, the US, through NATO and other alliances exercises hegemony over its subjects and allies."
217,Who is responsible for failure of Nord Stream pipeline?,"Listen, none of US know. The only people who *actually know* are people within the high-level intelligence apparatuses of various states.

218,Can a country join NATO whilst that same country is in a state of war?,"NATO procedures generally don’t allow it. However, the treaty itself doesn’t explicitly ban it. Even if it did, you need unanimous consent to add members anyway. If you had unanimous consent to add a country but it broke some rule in the treaty, you could just stick “Rule *number* is waived” in the accession protocols and that would override the treaty. This happened when Turkey was added: originally it only covered member territory in North America, Europe, and the North Atlantic. Most of Turkey is in Asia. So, the accession protocols just changed the treaty so it would also cover the Asian part of Turkey.

That said, it’s hard to imagine NATO adding a country actively at war unless NATO is already at war with that country’s enemy. If Switzerland had invaded Austria and NATO added Austria as a member, NATO would immediately have to go to war against Switzerland."
219,Are there any restrictions stopping the President from also simultaneously being the Speaker of the House?,You can't be a member of two branches of government at the same time though some feel that part of the constitution isn't completely clear I think even this supreme court would not allow it.

222,Why aren’t US state lines re-drawn the same way districts are?,"Because there's no mechanism to do so. When the country was founded it was imagined as a bunch of ostensibly independent entities (states) uniting under a common federal government to pool resources, make the united country more formidable internationally, etc. Under that mindset, changing state borders would entail violating the independence of these separate states."
223,"Why is healthcare in America so expensive, and what policies and laws have helped/hurt this in the last couple of decades?","Good systems require checks and balances. If apple started making broken hardware or charging 10k for phones, people would change brands.

Healthcare has neither of those. Providers can charge what they like and people keep calling 911 and keep coming through the door in droves. And you can’t even vote against it. So it only gets worse. 

But we’re not living in a vacuum, the only place in the universe with healthcare, staring at unknown options. Other countries fixed this generations ago. We are choosing not to follow their lead."
224,Why is a Head of State required in a Westminster Parliamentary System?,In a parlamentary system the Head of State represents the political system stability. In that system the prime minister can stay in Power for years or even days. That's why it wouldnt make the PM be the Head of State. But a president can be elected by Congress like It happens in south africa.
225,Has the Biden administration hindered progress to solve supply-side problems?,"Yes, because he is following long- standing Democrat policy of demand- side economics. Rather then address supply shortages, labor being a big one, he pushes spending plans that pump rediculous sums of money into programs like his student loan forgiveness and taxes people with the means to invest capital in projects that would increase supply. While his immigration policy eases labor shortages it hinders wage growth, especially for the working class."
226,Why do some congress representatives (usually leadership) write vastly more legislation than others?,Do you have a source for the numbers of legislation written?

227,What mechanism does the judicial branch have for ensuring their rulings are actually carried out?,"The judicial branch has no mechanism to enforce its rulings.

229,are there any political systems that limit the size of parties?,[deleted]
230,How did the British stop being imperial?,"Post WWII there was simply no appetite for the fighting that would have been necessary to maintain their empire. Most of their African possessions were rebelling, or on the edge of it, and India was clearly ready to break into full fledged rebellion any day. They were broke, two generations of men had died in the last two world wars, and no one wanted to keep fighting."
231,Was EU-Russia economic interdependence part of a EU security system?,"I heard this from a European expert but can't find the article so take my word with a grain of salt.

Western Europe post-war, after some time passed, had a mindset that the lesson of WWII is they need to integrate. Both wars were started because nations believed in their individual supremacy and felt that entitled them to conquest. And so while there was certainly an economic component to things like the EEC and EU, a lot of the language used by people pushing it was that this would be the way to ensure none of our nations get in their head they should start another war. That the consequence for another war could be 1 in every 3 young people dead or disabled as had happened twice already. This was the pan-european ethos that began building up in the latter half of the cold war, a belief that war can be avoided with interconnectedness and believing in something larger than your individual nation. 

At the end of the cold war, those pan-European institutions began expanding eastward. They seemed to generally share these values and so nothing was openly challenging Western Europe's assumptions about the lessons from WWII. 

So the natural order would be continued integration with all of Europe, including Russia. After all, Europe made complex things Russians would buy in droves, and Russia had vast raw resources greater than anything Western Europe had within their borders. More than half of all Russian imports came from Europe and more than half of all Russian exports went to Europe. So, thinking this was just an expansion of cooperation and integration, many nations developed with an assumption that they could always count on those raw resources from Russia.

But 2014 changed that calculus. They invaded, occupied and declared soverignty over Crimea and had a years long war in Eastern Ukraine. It changed some nations views regarding Russia, and many slowly started becoming less dependent on Russia. But the steak through the heart of the idea of peacefull integration of Russia came in Febuary.

Because that story of WWII that western Europe has is not the perspective Russia has on the Great Patriotic War. It wasn't a tale of nations believing conquest was justified. Russia started the war on the side of the Nazis, expanding eastward for the baltic states and part of Poland. But Russian history doesn't consider that part of the Great Patriotic War. That war didn't start until Germany betrayed Russia and attempted to invade. It wasn't a lesson about the folly of expansion, after all they got to keep what they expanded into. It was just a tail about Western Europe being threatened by Russian might. And so the solution is not a universal disarmament and cooperation, it's to say that Russia's authority shall not be challenged. 

So Western Europe thought integration with Russia *was* part of their security. And what they're realizing now is they aren't as similar as they thought they were."
232,Why don't Russian soldiers just shut down the power plant in Zaporizhzhia?,"[Targeting civilian infrastructure is a war crime](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule7_sectionc).

So far Russia has been... indifferent about whether or not it's conducting war crimes but this would have no strategic value - it would not impede Ukraine's military capability - so it would provoke a massive international response for very little tactical or strategic gain."
233,Why do people keep saying Judge Aileen M. Cannon doesn't have jurisdiction over the Trump case?,"In order for Trump to have standing to request a special master, he must show the judge that the FBI’s search was improper.

Trump has said he can’t say if the search was improper until a special master is appointed.

Cannon has decided to appoint a special master for Trump, to help Trump possibly show the search was improper, giving Cannon the jurisdiction to appoint a special master.

It’s Möbius strip logic.

Normally to challenge a search *before a criminal trial* the impropriety must be facially obvious — like the search warrant listed someone else’s address.

Further, [44 U.S. Code § 2204 - Restrictions on access to Presidential records](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2204)

> The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction over any action initiated by the former President asserting that a determination made by the Archivist violates the former President’s rights or privileges.

Trump is challenging the Archives rights to the classified documents and presidential documents in his possession. He doesn’t want to challenge this in DC, because the courts there are less favorable, so he’s wrapping it into this civil action."

237,What does the King/Queen of England *actually* do?,"The monarch and their immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing honors and appointing the prime minister, which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is also able to advise, generally done in secret, to change draft laws. The monarch is also Head of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent. The Government of the United Kingdom is known as His Majesty's Government.  


That's the VERY basics."
238,"Western nations have, currently and historically, been using sanctions as political tool to achieve their goals - have any country also made use of sanctions in the same way?","""Sanctions"" is a relatively modern word. Nowadays it tends to mean something pretty specific as marketplaces and corporations have globalized and standardized. There's no real difference in a corporation created in Japan or Russia or America or Spain or wherever. Because sanctions are such a modern word with a relatively specific meaning, you're not really going to look back in history and see sanctions across human development. 

But if you adjust your question a little bit to understand that sanctions are merely the modern example of governments using economic opportunity as a tool with which to act towards other governments, then it become apparent that countries/governments have always used economic opportunity as a tool."

Now, not all of them are totally useless as good ones still provide a good insight on the party, how government generally operates, and the history of everything, as a whole but you have to be aware that Xi has taken most experts by surprise and things are very different now than ten years ago.  

Outside of that though, Kissinger is worth reading because he is pretty much a primary source on historical USA-Chinese relations and thus has insight there.  I wouldn't take his modern analysis of China seriously though, as he always been criticized for being extremely uncritical of China and taking their statements at face value, which has made him more and more out of touch with the current political climate in China."
240,Why does the perception of the value of ones vote increase as one gets older?,Older people vote more consistently. Older people have more wealth and connections to influence policy and politicians.
241,Can you recommend a comprehensive book or course on UK politics from the postwar era to now?,"Perhaps Andrew Marr’s A History or Modern Britain for a general overview. If you want to dive a little deeper into the 1970s, I’d highly recommend When the Lights Went Out by Andy Beckett."

Another very important 'channel' of influence are private schools. In [Truss's cabinet](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/new-cabinet-poshest-since-john-majors-68-educated-private-schools-1839128) 68 percent of members have been educated in private schools. 35 percent of ministers attended Oxford or Cambridge. In the overall population only 7 percent have been educated in private schools. PPE at Oxford is [famous](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/feb/23/ppe-oxford-university-degree-that-rules-britain) for producing prime ministers and other British politicians. 

Of course, private schooling is not cheap. The *average* private school fee is currently [£13,700 per year.](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/08/english-private-school-fees-90-higher-than-state-school-spending-per-pupil) For those completing A-levels this year parents would have had to [pay](https://www.ft.com/content/871ab998-bd4e-4c82-9504-43eae163c2cb) around £179,000 in total for day schools and £365,000 for boarding schools, on average. For those starting private school this year parents can expect to pay somewhere between £218,000 (at 0 percent fee increase) to £414,000 (at 8 percent fee increase) for day schools and £427,000 (at 0 percent fee increase) to £851,000 (at 8 percent fee increase) for boarding schools, on average. And that is before university tuition. As a result, only a section of the British population will be able to afford such an education and reap the benefits thereof later in life."
243,Was the unified sanctions effort by the West meant to set a precedent?,"I mean, I'm not sure what you mean by ""precedent."" There is no binding legal requirement or even influence that one sanctions action has on a future action. If you ask instead if it's meant to ""send a message"" then I would say of course yes. The whole point of an alliance like NATO is that by challenging one, you challenge all. It would be a pretty crappy alliance if that didn't happen. Yes, very much part of the idea of applying sanctions is to communicate to countries that don't have sanctions that they REALLY don't want to do anything that would result in them getting sanctions."

248,If the majority in the U.S. House were to flip to the other party due to special elections/party changes would the incumbent speaker be able to remain in office for the remainder of the session or would they be forced to step down?,"The Speaker of the House is elected by a majority of the House. If the party flipped in the middle of the term, the Speaker would still be the speaker, but the now majority party can push a vote on the Speaker and elect someone else.

So to answer your question, the Speaker is the Speaker for the length of the term unless voted out. So if the House flipped, the new majority would likely call a vote for a new Speaker, but COULD leave the Speaker in place."
249,Why isn’t Iraq utilizing its access to sea at the SE corner of the country? Why isn’t this area of the country more developed from trade?,"It does use it. I used to work there. The ports at Umm Qasr are primarily used for food and medicine as they’re up the Shatt-Al-Arab river and the water isn’t very deep. The US, Japan, and Germany have all assisted in shoring these ports back up for commerce and security operations. 

They export oil from the KAAOT and ABOT oil terminals in the Gulf."
250,"Why is the Iraq War-era peace movement not as well-remembered as the Vietnam peace movement, in spite of its cultural impact?","It just wasn't as *big.*

It seems weird to say that about the largest anti-war protest in human history (Feb 2003) but the anti-Iraq War movement just wasn't as comprehensive and polarizing as the protests against the Vietnam War.

It's important to remember that violence was a much more consistent part of the anti-war movement with regards to Vietnam. Draft offices were raided and the paperwork in them destroyed or the offices themselves were blown up or burned down and you had protest groups bombing targets related to the war effort. During the war itself you had instances of ""fragging,"" or soldiers deliberately killing other soldiers or more often, commanding officers. There were around a thousand documented instances of this happening with many more suspected. 

Anti-war protests themselves were comparatively quite violent. Police weren't as well armed but firehoses, dogs, and batons were regular participants and protesters pretty regularly clashed with police in ways we didn't see again until you had the rise of more heavily militarized police in the US and incidents like the WTO protests in the 90's.

That simply does not have a correlate in the 2000's anti-war protest movement. It was, by and large, very civil and violence was abhorred by most of the larger participating organizing bodies. You didn't have people blowing up recruitment offices or killing their commanding officers out of anger and frustration.

It's also important to remember that the Iraq War enjoyed *a lot* more popular support at home than the Vietnam War eventually had. Even as the war dragged on, a lot of Americans still really weren't against the war, at least not in a way that might prompt them to blow up a building or throw a brick at a cop. People weren't being drafted and sent to Vietnam, they were voluntarily signing up to go to Iraq.

The casualties were vastly different as well. Something like 60,000 killed and 300,000 wounded in Vietnam vs 4,500 killed and 30,000 wounded in Iraq. That coupled with the overall tenor of the wars was wildly different.

We weren't *winning* in Iraq but we also weren't getting hundreds of kids being sent back in body bags every week with more being forced to go fight. We had casualties but it wasn't this never-ending drum beat of hundreds and hundreds, many of whom weren't going of their own free will. We weren't winning in Vietnam and it fueled frustration because it felt like we were feeding young men into the meat grinder for no reason. 

That psychological weight added a lot of fuel to the anti-war movement that just wasn't there for Iraq."
251,"Can student loan forgiveness be ""reversed""?","Unlikely. The DOJ has released their justification that the Heroes Act (which also allowed Trump and Biden to pause interest/payments) gives the DOEd the power to forgive the loans. 

[link](https://www.justice.gov/olc/opinion/use-heroes-act-2003-cancel-principal-amounts-student-loans)

Edit: in order to reverse this they would first have to justify standing. Then argue against the heros act justification. Not sure they can.

Also it would be another blow to the GOP if they reverse this, who appears to be taking some hits lately."
252,"What effect, if any, did the assassination of Darya Dugina actually have?","It presumably sends the message that Moscow elites are not immune to the conflict, and that there are costs and risks to war. Whether that is a wise message to send is a separate question."
253,"Can I, an American citizen who has never lived in the US but has registered to vote in the coming midterms as an overseas voter, somehow vote in the midterms while on vacation away from the country I live in?","You don't have a congressman to represent you, so no. You can only vote in countrywide at large elections such as the presidency. Unlike military personnel, you don't even have a state of residency since you've never resided in the US.

Being that you've never even lived in the United States, ethically you should simply opt out of its politics."
254,How do PACs reach donors?,"PACs solicit donors in almost the same way as candidates do. They have fundraisers, send texts and emails, send mail, and of course make phone calls (called 'dialing for dollars' in the industry). These tactics are the same for small and large donors alike.

For how they decide WHO to target, it's a little more difficult. They can do donor list swaps with friendly organizations, they can do cold contacts to voters whose profiles match their target supporters, or run ads online. Over the years they build their own lists of faithful donors to resolicit.

Most PAC money comes from a small handful of wealthy donors, who their fundraisers or directors know from past experience, or who are prolific in the industry."
255,What happens either chamber of Congress tie in a contingent election?,"The mechanics of the process is multiple rounds of voting.

In practice, a ton of backroom negotiation.

In the 1800 election there were 36 rounds of balloting until a winner emerged.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election#Electoral_College_selection)

If your question is how that negotiation would come to a resolution, that's likely above Reddit's pay grade."
256,Are there resources available on how each state processes an election and secures their vote?,"The perhaps too obvious suggestions I have are to just call each state's election administration agency/secretary of state and ask what their procedures are, or if they have any referrals, or try and find actual poll workers and talk to them.  (I assume you are potentially politically active so your own state party probably has folks who do stuff for this.)  I also imagine each state theoretically has these procedures written in an election law statute somewhere, so check the state legislature pages for state laws.  If you have money to invest, you could theoretically also contact election law lawyers in each state and ask them for a summary, too (which I admit may be beyond the resources of your project)."
257,What is fascism exactly?,"Entire books have been written on this subject.

I don't think it's wrong to say that ""fascist"" has become somewhat of an over-used insult or accusation but that doesn't change the fact that it does have an actual meaning.

If you wanted to *really* cut it down to the wiring of a definition of fascism, that's doable.

Fascism is a political ideology that revolves around the centralized power of the state as the embodiment of a national character, often represented by a single individual or small group, it heavily relies on an idealized/mythological a-historical that's pieced together specifically for the purpose of creating the idea of a single, unified national identity. There's a strong militaristic/law and order bent with a high degree of social militarization and adulation of the armed forces that also ties into a cult of heroism and action along with a glorification of violence for the sake of the state with an intense focus on internal/external ""enemies"" that threaten to destroy everything.

Fascism is *highly* syncretic and that broad framework can map onto almost any cultural context. You had Showa Nationalism in Japan, Falangism in Spain, Nazism in Germany, and Shirt movements in dozens of countries around the world. 

Anywhere you can mix ideas of intense nationalism, authoritarian state control, rejuvenating powers of violence, and a unified/idealized cultural/ethnic/historical identity you can end up with fascism.

There's the famous 14 characteristics of fascism as put forth by Umberto Eco and while these are helpful guides, people tend to treat these like a checklist - if it doesn't meet one of the criteria on the list exactly then it's not fascism. ""Ur-Fascism"" is still an excellent read even today but again, people tend to use Eco's thesis as a diagnostic tool rather than a prompt for inquiry.

Of course, actual fascists love to cite the list because they can push to do this deliberately as a way of avoiding having their favorite fascist state/movement be characterized as such."
258,Why Doesn't the State or Federal Government threaten to end road funding If a city is blocking all affordable housing development?,"Delaying major infrastructure projects to pressure local officials into approving highly lucrative private real estate deals...

259,What’s going on with the Respect for Marriage Act?,"After passing the Inflation Reduction Act, congress went to their home districts for a few weeks. They will come back after Labor Day but will leave to campaign sometime in late September or early October. 

So there's no progress in large part because everyone's back home (or using the time for vacation) and it's hard to get progress when no one is in DC actively negotiating and working through things.

It's too soon to call it dead. When Congress comes back they'll only have a few weeks of legislating before the election and we'll see what they do with it.

Edit: to add extra context, The US government uses October 1st as the ""new year"" for budgeting. That means there are still several departments that need funding or would shut down Oct 1st. This could be a quick ""delay it till after November"" or it could be dragged out because they can not have a single senate defector. Joe Manchin is wanting to put a permitting reform package in it, and a few progressives have complained. Permitting reform means quicker environmental studies and less chances to cancel a big project, so easier to build oil pipelines but also easier to build wind and solar farms. AOC has supported something like it since it makes green infrastructure much cheaper, so hopefully progressives don't make this a big deal. But if Democrats can hold together an not fight, there may be time to work on RMA in that period too. Otherwise it may be a struggle to keep the lights on before September ends."
260,Why don't new political parties focus on local level elections in the US?,"A question I can answer! I'm a political consultant, and have had very lengthy talks with some of the libertarian state party leaders. I have suggested to them that they are putting the cart before the horse, and need to establish a strong base before building up to statewide races. I agree with you, but they respond with 2 major points:

1. In many states there is a threshold of 3-5%, that if a party reaches or exceeds in the top election on the ballot last cycle, they are given easier ballot access in the future. (eg. in Illinois, if you are in a Major Party(your party reached that threshold) you need 5000* petition signatures for statewide races and can start collecting in late fall, but if you are a New Party(you didn't reach that threshold) you will need 15,000 petition sigs and cannot begin collecting till mid-winter. *Dates and numbers may have changed slightly since I last looked it up.)

1. Top of the ticket races are sexier. They bring in donors, volunteers, and afford them easier access to earned media (free spots on tv and in other news media)

Between those two reasons, it becomes almost a necessity for third parties to run someone in the statewide race, and only then do their best to recruit lower level candidates. On that subject, recruiting candidates is hard. Like really hard. The major parties have an issue with it everywhere, and while a lot of that is due to old, rusty party infrastructure, that decline in an interest in being part of the party infrastructure is often due to not having enough local candidates, a vicious cycle. How much worse for those 3rd parties who have little or no infrastructure.

Tldr. Top ticket races are sexy and bring in the dough, recruiting candidates is hard af, and ballot access is given only to those who do well in those top races."
261,Is it true that all of the aid from the US to Ukraine will need to be repaid?,"No. The equipment comes from many sources. The Lend Lease Act is a fiction: we are not getting or expecting to get back our weapons. I can’t find any loans in the acts. Even programs like foreign military financing through the state department, they’re buying long term equipment we’re giving them aid to buy. In the short term we’re transferring arms and paying to replace our own. 

Some of the money goes to our own farmers. The bills cover up to 2026. If you’ve noticed there actually has been zero hearing about Ukraine aid oversight. It’s all in multiple special speedy bills. There’s a lot of weird stuff in these bills as expected."
262,How much more effective are parliamentary systems at passing legislation the incumbent government wants compared to presidential systems?,"In general, a parliamentary system would be more effective at enacting the executive branch's legislative agenda. In a parliamentary system the executive branch leads the legislative process based on the support it receives from the majority of its membership. If a prime minister doesn't enjoy the support of their legislature they usually don't get to remain in office. If the legislature can't select anyone to be prime minister it usually results in early elections.

In a presidential system the executive and legislative branch are more independent from each other. Using the US as an example you have a greater chance of a divergence of opinion between the executive and legislative branch then you would in a parliamentary system. The president, representatives, and senators are all elected at different times, for different term lengths. The president being elected every 4 years, Representatives being elected every two years, and senators serving 6-year terms staggered into two-year intervals between three senatorial classes.

In contrast in a parliamentary system the prime minister is chosen almost immediately after the parliament is elected. The odds of them differing on opinion is smaller. But it's not impossible.

Parliamentary systems can gridlock too under the right circumstances. Famously, this happened in Belgium about a few years ago. A parliament was elected that was too fragmented to choose a prime minister, but was unwilling to call an early election. The Belgian Parliament went 592 days without choosing a prime minister. That became a world record."
263,How is Henry Kissinger perceived in terms of his political motivations and ideology?,"You either like Machiavelli or hate him. So you either think that being *effective* at achieving your policy goals is more important than being moral, or you think this is a horrible idea and the ends never justify the ends. 

If you go with the Machiavellian approach, the guy's a Saint. If not, he's Satan."
264,"Is ""Sodomy"" still a legal category in the United States (despite Lawrence v. Texas)?","Currently, sodomy is the name of a sex crime in some jurisdictions. This is distinct from the sex acts at issue in Lawrence because the act currently criminalized are non-consensual."
265,Which USA States allow the State Legislature or Governor to override a presidential election results in their State and send different Electoral College Delegates?,"Presently none.  But the SCOTUS will take up. Case next session to address that.

It would set off a Constitutional crisis."
266,"Why aren't there more ""single issue"" bills brought before congress?","This is an area where voters don't really understand how legislating works. The result is everyone thinks passing a single issue bill makes a lot of sense, but if you actually understand how legislating works, then it really doesn't. And that results in voters thinking Congress sucks, when really they don't suck (for the reasons voters think they do at least). Let's get into it.

One factor here is that the single issues you're focusing on are not issues that do have broad support by both parties. The Reps don't want to extend the Child Tax Credit. Nor do they want to do away with the Carried Interest loophole. So you're starting at a position where there aren't enough votes do these things even if there is only one thing we're focusing on. 

So how do we get more people to vote for this thing? You're not going to convince the Reps to change their policy position. The only way that happens is if Rep voters force their representatives to change. But that's not happening.

So instead, you just make it worth their while to compromise. Instead of just passing the CTC, you pass a bill that extends the CTC but also does something the Reps want. They're going to ask for a few things, and then you suggest if the Reps want all those things, then the Dems have a few things they want to do on those issues as well, and if we're negotiating compromise, we might as well negotiate compromise. Pretty soon, this bill that was originally designed to address a single issue has turned into an omnibus bill because you need multiple facets involved to get different things to compromise back and forth on.

We do see bills that have bipartisan appeal pass more easily without being big omnibus bills. For example, look at the recent gun control bill passed by Biden. That was a bill that had broad support across the parties and it passed without bundling in a bunch of other stuff."
267,Why is the US messing with China?,"Trade talks are a form of dialogue with China to get back to some kind of normal so that’s not really ‘messing’ with China.

Pelosi visited Taiwan for roughly 12 hours in-between trips elsewhere. She isn’t the first nor the last Congressmember to do that. That’s Congress’ right. China chose to overreact in that case and throw a fit for no apparent reason. So, again, not really messing with anyone. Probably the greater question is why China is messing with Taiwan - there should be greater priorities."
268,"What is the purpose of ""declaring a state of emergency""?",It's a funding thing.  It's much easier to direct/appropriate funds for declared disasters.
269,Is there a tracker to show current government appointments?,"Probably not because such a tool would be waaaaay too huge to maintain. The President technically appoints a huge number of appointees, not just the highest level guys, so this would quickly become really impossible to keep up to date. Also most of those appointments are not really a political/partisan activity, so it's not really clear how useful such a tool would be.

All of the major appointees are something you can just look up. Maybe if you think this tool would be really useful, you can create it yourself."
270,Presidential Pardons: Can a US President rescind a presidential pardon that was given by a previous president?,"Yes. It has happened a few times before in US history. I believe Clinton reversed one of his own pardons after receiving more info about someone he pardoned. I know Andrew Johnson had some of his pardons reversed by Ulysses S. Grant - but that's suspect because the pardons issued were never received. 

They can also be reversed if the president has been impeached (not removed, but impeached). That is to protect the rule of law and ensure a president cannot pardon their partners in crime to which they are a part of.

Remember a pardon is required if there is guilt. An admission of guilt or conviction is required for a pardon to be issued...(that's the one that gets me)."
271,"If X bill passes the House in 2022, when the new congress meets in 2023, can the 23 Senate simply vote bill X or does the 23 House have to vote it again?","A bill that is not enacted in a 2 year Congress dies when that Congress adjourns. It can be reintroduced with a new bill number though.

The issue is that the composition of the house changes 100% every 2 years, creating a “new” Congress, whereas the Senate changes 1/3 every 2 years, so you lose the votes that said yes/no when that Congress adjourns, necessitating a new vote in both houses.

For our purposes, that happens after the midterms (2023 change of Congress)"
272,Are there any examples of American sports teams/rivalries with followings split along political lines?,"When it comes to teams in the same city/region, you often do see slight differences in fanbase demographics, mainly due to location. For example, the Oakland A's are stereotypically a more ""blue collar"" and racially diverse fanbase compared to the SF Giants. Similar story for the Sox and Cubs. That being said, these divisions are typically driven by location and really more stereotypes than hard facts.

That being said, teams generally avoid outright political alignment, outside of generic pro-Americanism. You might get teams with outspoken owners, players, or a general culture of leaning a certain way, but nothing official."
273,"Is it possible, or what would be the process of finding an impartial jury for a trial involving an Ex President?","I believe you are confusing the issues when jury selecting. The issue is not: Do you know the defendant (or witnesses)? Rather, the inquiry is: Can you be impartial in your determination and application of the law to the facts.

Certainly, there are people out there who would know the ex-president, but are indifferent or apolitical."
274,[US-Oregon] Does being registered to a 3rd party make any difference?,"Since you have closed primaries, yes. You should always register as the party whose primary you want to vote in, unless you live in an open primary state. There's no rule, legally or informally, that says you have to vote for your affiliated party in the general election. 

I always say ""I'm X at heart, but Y on paper"", because I'm signed up for the majority party in my state even though I have opposite beliefs. This is because the same party always gets elected, so the primary is more important than the general election here.

In some states the number of registered voters for a third party affect their presence on the ballot... but they don't have much of a chance unless you have ranked choice voting, anyway."
275,Can you be president from jail?,"Yes. Eugene Debs ran from jail.

But this is completely unprecedented. The state governor would almost certainly issue a pardon, as it would be incredibly controversial to not do so.

In the UK the Houses of Parliament can order a prisoner to be brought to them."
276,Why should I vote for president in a state where the majority consistently votes against my party of choice,"Because if other people thought the way you did, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. You have to assume your vote counts or you run the risk that too many people don’t vote, regardless of where they live."
277,What happens if a NATO Member willing joins a defensive war?,"There is no cut-and-dry answer to this question because it is political in nature. NATO article 5 is non-binding, so each member state can make up their own mind about whether they would defend Poland if Polish territory gets attacked as a result of them joining the war in Ukraine. 

Realistically, before Poland joined the war in Ukraine, they would discuss this with the other NATO member states and they would try to come up with a coherent strategy. No one can tell you what that strategy would like because it is entirely dependent on who is in power in the member states and what the current situation in Ukraine is."
278,Is the French Left dead now in the 2020s?,"The Fench Socialist Party is dead, but the french left is not. Jean-Luc Melanchon and his party La France Insoumise have effectively built a hard-left coalition that has been electorally successful. Melanchon got 20% of the vote in the last presidential election and 69 seats in the National Assembly. The French Communist Party hasn't gotten numbers close to that since the 70s. 

The French Green Party didn't do so well in the last presidential election, but they did come in third in the last European Parliament elections"
279,What's preventing countries from trading with their neighbors?,"Nothing, physically. Which is also a theme I think you'll come to notice quite a lot once you start looking into political relationships. Both international and domestic. Most groups and nations can do a lot of things. However, the big but here is that other people can have a reaction to the thing that the first group/nation did.

In this case, yes, China could physically ship train load after train load of tanks into Russia. Physically, China could send an army into Ukraine via Russia and invade the nation alongside Russia. No one could stop that directly.

But the world can and would respond. China is attempting to become a super power. To do that, it needs soft power even more than hard power. The world's nation's will largely recoil if China becomes more actively involved on the side of Russia. Chinese economic deals will be canceled. Opinions of China will plummet. Cultural ties will be severed. Chinese soft power will be smacked around pretty badly, just as it's being built up. 

Then they also risk a more targeted response. Western sanctions could stab a deep hole into the Chinese economy. Their finance system in particular was build to join the western system, so the quick and brutal removal of the Chinese finance system from the broader world it was designed for would be very bad for it. 

And so far, China hasn't been willing to provoke these reactions. 

You can do a lot of things physically. But then so can other people."
280,Would it benefit Taiwan to assert independence while simultaneously dropping the claim of being the legitimate Chinese government?,"Taiwan has dropped their (serious) claim of being the legitimate Chinese government years ago.


China on the other hand has very seriously stated that Taiwanese independence would be the same thing as a declaration of war to them.


So no, there is no way for Taiwan to ever get independence without there being either war or extreme changes in chinas political landscape."
281,Why isn't the State right to freely pick electors for the POTUS election used?,"To clarify, are you asking why more states don't choose their presidential electors *through their legislatures*?"

Funfact, none of those people are considered to be actually Neoconservatives by experts (though Cheney and Rumsfeld are allied).

And they are still a thing in the GOP, but are no longer the dominate Foreign Policy group and have been mostly on the defensive since Trump has taken over."
283,How badly has the lack of response to Taiwan effected Xi Jingping's standing within the party and chance at reelection?,How badly is this affecting Xi Jinping's chances at re-election? It's having almost no effect at all. Xi is guaranteed to win a third term in office.
284,Have any politicians introduced a bill to try and incentivise businesses to switch to working from home in order to reduce the pollution created from daily commuting and heating/cooling large offices?,"Politicians in city centers are doing the opposite, trying to get people to return to their offices to stimulate downtown economies."
285,Does conservative media ever disparage (or even mention) labor unions?,"A quick browse through [Fox News' 'labor unions' tag](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/labor-unions) shows most of the headlines are negative toward unions.

288,"What's the extent of the concept of ""Indigenous peoples""?","There is no formal, official definition of indigenous, although individual countries or jurisdictions might have them.

[However, here is a very common definition from the United Nations.](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf)

>Considering the diversity of indigenous peoples, an official definition of “indigenous” has not been adopted by any UN-system body. Instead the system has developed a modern understanding of this term based on the following  
>  
>•  Self- identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member.    
>  
>•  Historical continuity with pre-colonial  and/or pre-settler societies   
>  
>•  Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources   
>  
>•  Distinct social, economic or political systems   
>  
>•  Distinct language, culture and beliefs   
>  
>•  Form non-dominant groups of society    
>  
>•  Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities. 

There are two main points here that prevent everyone (or no one) from being considered. A group has to largely self-identify as indigenous and form a non-dominant group within a given society.  So Greeks are not indigenous, despite meeting most of these criteria, since they 1)Don't identify as indigenous and 2)Are the dominant group in Greece. 

This also means a group could be indigenous and one point in history and cease to be indigenous when their political situation changes."

290,How can USA/NATO drone strike someone in another country that they are not at war with?,">last time I rembember it was that Soleimani guy from Iran that they stright up bombed in another country's teritory, just like that and nobody cares that it happend like that.

They did.  It was actually a pretty big international incident and required the intervention of Germany and Japan to prevent it from escalating.  The USA and Iran were extremely close to going to war at that point."
291,Is it possible for the US to ever be able to elect a coalition govt?,"I’m not sure the idea of a “coalition government” even makes sense in American politics. The United States doesn’t form “governments” at each election like Parlamentary systems do.

As I understand it, parlamentary legislators are usually voted for by party, the party then chooses what actual human to stick in the seats they’ve won, and that human is then usually bound to vote in accordance with that party’s policies. Then you need a majority (either one party majority or a coalition) to agree to work together to appoint all the Ministers (including Prime) that form the actual Execitive that does stuff. 

In the U.S., the parties don’t technically exist, every legislator is elected as an individual, and thus they can (and do) “break ranks” and vote against their party whenever they feel like it.

And the Executive is voted separately, so no majority is required in the legislature. The Senate is supposed to confirm all the Secretaries that run the individual departments, but somebody as always “Acting Secretary of Whatever” (and generally taking orders explicitly from the President) until the Senate get around to confirming the President’s nominees. No majority among parties is required to get these guys confirmed though, even with no majority you just have to convince enough individual  Senators to vote for each guy (and it doesn’t have to be the same Senators in each case). So the President usually just finds someone who appeals to enough individual Senators, or there are behind the scenes deals to pass legislation particular Senators want in exchange for voting in the guys the President nominates.

If somehow a third party gained a significant presence in our congress, not having a majority in the two legislative houses would create some weird procedural issues since right now we assume there is a “Majority Leader” and “Minority Leader”, and committees and such are supposed to have members of “both” parties, but the Constitution doesn’t recognize the parties anyway so they would work it out somehow. Again, you just need to get a majority of individual legislators (not parties) to vote in each change that needs to be made, and voting together on one issue does not in any way create the expectation that you will always vote with that “coalition” on other issues. So everything would just move through eventually, in small pieces, with different and ever-shifting “coalitions” making deals with each other. There would never be a formal agreement to form a “government” and always vote together on everything.

The Vice President used to be the runner up of the Presidential election, but we amended that hundreds of years ago and now it’s technically a separate election, but in practice the same party that wins the presidency is also going to win the vice-presidency. The VP’s only real power is breaking tie votes in the Senate, anything else they do is just whatever the President feels like delegating to them.

As for changing our system, I think most of my fellow Americans erroneously think the 2-party system is how it is supposed to be. At best, they are resigned to thinking it can never be changed. Even among those of us that would like to change it, I don’t think we all agree that going to a proportional system is the way to go. So there is no real movement toward proportional , or anything else, right now."
292,"How difficult is it to apply for & maintain welfare benefits, & how does this difficulty vary by state? Is ""welfare"" considered more of a package of benefits vs. a single thing? In my mind I think of food stamps, Medicaid, & housing/rental vouchers as being ""welfare"" but they are different programs.","A lot depends on the state you live in. Different states have different rules. More on that in a moment.

Welfare consists of various programs. TANF or SSI. TANF is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. SSI is Supplemental Security Income and is for long term disablity for those that don't have enough credits in their Social Security account. A good example is my oldest grandson. He's been drawing SSI for most of his life. He was diagnosed with epilepsy about the age of 12. Even if he could find work that he could do, he'd be limited as most employers don't want a worker than can suddenly have a seizure. He won't even get the option of working in a sheltered workshop because his mother won't untie the apron strings. These people are often on the program for life. It's not easy.

TANF, OTOH, is a welfare program that is set up as a stopgap: breadwinner unable to work due to an temporary illness or injury. Usually a low income family to begin with. It also is a program that many single parents (usually mothers) end up on. If they have a pre-school child, they are not forced to get a job. Benefits for this are based on the household income. In Indiana, the maximum accountable income for a family of three is $596 a month. Being a red state, it's geared towards single mothers.  At one time, the only  way a household with a male adult would qualify is if he was disabled. (temp or permanent) THEN HE has to prove his inability to work. (medical records, etc) 

So this most commonly pointed at segment of welfare pretty much excludes about half the population.

Medicaid. Yes, it is a welfare program. Amazingly enough, I DO qualify for that as I am over 60 and disabled. If you are on TANF, the odds that your minor children are also covered by this to one extent or another. Likewise, if you are pregnant. I only s. (note: Red States have the most stringent requirements) Example: I receive $1,557 a month in disalability payments. (I had enough credits when I became disabled in 2008 to qualify for SSD - which is NOT a welfare program) Because ""I make too much"" I do not qualify for SNAP. (Thank goodness the food banks don't have such stringent rules. More on that later)

Medicaid. Yes, it is a welfare program. Amazingly enough, I DO qualify for that as I am over 60 and disabled. If you are on TANF, the odds that your minor children are also covered by this to one extent or another. Likewise, if you are pregnant. I only qualified for it about 5 years ago, just after my 60th birthday. It's not always easy. As I qualify for Medicare, I also have an insurance plan through Anthem that is really great. (sorry, only available for disabled seniors that have Medicaid and Medicare. Indiana did a great thing by ousting Mike Pence)   


The ""easiest"" program to get on would be SNAP. For that, you have to have a low income per household size. Earned income vs household expenditures. (Or unearned income, like TANF or SSI) 

Other programs that fall under the ""welfare title"" would be Subsidized housing. Note: even that had a limit. A married couple can get it if only ONE of them works, but if the second is employed, they lose it. (at least here in Indiana)

Why aren't they ""sucking at the teet"" of the government? Because what you receive from those programs are bare existence living. I worked hard and had a lot of low paying jobs because I lacked the networking skills and contacts to get better jobs. Much of my working life, I worked jobs I could get, and usually qualified for food stamps because of my family size. (Note: when my wife was pregnant with our son, we applied and, SHAZAM, I made $10 a month too much. Living in a Red State) 

I make a LOT more than a lot of the people I know that draw Social Security benefits: retirement or disability. My ex, who became disabled a decade before me, never accumulated enough credits (even though I warned her back in our 20s) and drew SSI for most of that time period. The kicker: since I was working, her disbursement would fluctuate based on MY income.  Her base income on that, at the time, was about $525/month. If I put in a lot of OT, her payment went down. The first 5 months I was disabled (before getting my first disability payment) She got the max payment. Our SNAP payment went up while our rent went down. As soon as I got my first disability payment, her SSI was dropped because ""I made too much money."" 

Sound like I'm bleeding the government? I worked decades, hard work, both physically and mentally, until I couldn't work any more. 

Things I've been able to enjoy by the sweat of my labor? Color TVs. Cable TV and Internet, a roof over my head, food in my belly (The 90s saw my only good paying jobs) things that make life worth living.

Pensions? I took a buy out on the one that wasn't gutted when I had the opportunity because I no longer trust corporate America. I could have invested it, but, when I qualified for Medicaid, I was only allowed to have a total of $3K in assets. No 401K, monthly pension would have been counted against me, etc. 

One thing that HAS helped and been effective are the pilot programs of the Universal Basic Income. So far, the only place in the US that tried it was Oakland, CA, and they were quite successful with it. Recipients received $500 a month, no strings attached. The money didn't go to drugs and alcohol as the conservatives stated, but to those frivolities of utility payments, clothes or food, the basics in life. They didn't say, ""F\*\*\* this, I don't need to work for a living!"" No, they invested in their households. I won't say they didn't buy ANY luxury items: I'm sure the kids had a great Christmas. Who benefited? The recipients, Oakland Businesses, employers. Ya see, when your not stressed out about paying rent or electric, your body feels better and you don't call in sick (or as often) and you employer benefits as well.

That's why when I see a progressive point to the UBI as being good, it's because Trickle down didn't work. Lower taxes for the rich stayed with the rich. Raise their taxes to cover it, they'll still benefit, just not as obscenely as they have.

So when you hear people say welfare makes people lazy and become drains on society, the chances are they are the ones that are projecting."
293,Why wouldn't a US President use the Executive Order to get most of their larger agenda items enacted?,The only problem would be that the next President could reverse them all. Better to get laws passed.
294,What would happen if a president decides to become independent after getting elected as a Republican or Democrat?,"The President would serve the remainder of their term as an independent. That's it. 

Their support in Congress would be drastically diminished, making it a lot harder to advance their agenda. Their former party would run another candidate in the next election, which would at best split the base that elected this new president, so they wouldn't win reelection."
295,"Can someone tell me the difference between Francis Fukuyama's book, ""The End of History"" compared to ""The End of History and The Last Man""?","No; ""The End of History?"" is a 16 page paper published in The National Interest in 1989 (so before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Empire). If you have access to an academic library, you can read it at [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184) or similar  databases that have licenced that publication's content. 

The original print edition of his book was 418 pages and came three years later (and after some momentous shifts in history), so the length and scope of each isn't really comparable, even if the themes are."
296,What did the House change in the PACT act?,"
This was removed:

> (e) NOT A TAXABLE BENEFIT.—A contract buy out for a covered health care professional under subsection (a) shall not be considered a taxable benefit or event for the covered health care professional.

The benefit not being taxed is money being given to doctors who move to work with veterans in out of the way, rural areas.

This was removed because this provision was added by the senate, yet it generated a [blue slip](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_slip) as it ran afoul of the origination clause,

> All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.

I’m not entirely clear on blue slips — I didn’t think it applied to changes made to bills, just to the original text of bills."
297,What's the deal with US Cuba sanctions?,">What was the original reason for the sanctions?  


When we imposed sanctions on Cuba, the United States was following a policy called containment. The goal was to isolate Communist countries from the rest of the world as possible. We did have some trade relations with Communist countries, but not many, so the sanctions were not so hypocritical. 

Cuba was also especially important to the United States. Of course, Cuba is very close to the US, so it was considered a great threat than China or Angola (other countries with Communist revolutions). (And to be fair, Cuba did host nuclear weapons pointing directly at the u.s for a little while) Cuba was also part of the U.S. sphere of influence. The U.S. basically viewed Cuba as a colony; it fought a war for Cuba's independence and expected loyalty. The U.S. needed to show a strong response to the Cuban Revolution so as not to look like it couldn't defend it's own sphere of influence.

>Why did Obama lift them?  


Obama basically believed they weren't working, and so maintaining them seemed ridiculous. The Obama administration probably also believed that connecting Cuba to the broader world would ultimately lead to democratization. 

>Why did Trump reinstate them?

Because Trump had courted a small but influential group of hard-line Cuban-Americans, who fled the Cuban regime and perceive any thaw in Cuban-American relations as legitimizing the authoritarian regime that they, rightly, view as oppressive. 

>Why is Biden letting them stand?

According to the Cuban Democracy Act, the sanctions are supposed to remain in place until Cuba commits to ""democratization and greater respect for human rights."" Since Trump rescinded most of Obama's Cuban policies, the Cuban regime has backtracked on democratic and economic openings and become more repressive and restrictive. This is the official reason that Biden is not returning to the Cuban Thaw (and of course, Biden just has other priorities, inflation, the pandemic, Iran, Russia).

Of course, if you are the Cuban government, you are going to say, ""We promised you democratization in exchange for sanctions relief. You broke your part of the deal. Why should we honor it)

>f the government of Cuba hypothetically said ""We want to get those sanctions lifted and we're willing to do whatever it takes,"" what exactly would the US ask Cuba to do? 

Market-based economic reforms (mostly opening the country for trade and privatization) and multi-party elections. Probably also some agreement to honor the U.S. lease of Guantanamo Bay which the Cuban government currently considers illegitimate. 

>Then I'm not sure, yes Cuba's kind of evil, but what makes Cuba so special? We do business with other countries that do evil things, why do we turn the screws on Cuba so much?

Unlike China, Cuba is a small country that is isolated from the world economy. Economic sanctions on Cuba do not hurt U.S. consumers. Unlike Saudi Arabia, Cuba is not a U.S. ally, and it isn't an important part of American foreign policy in the region. 

>A long time ago, I read a rumor on the Internet that Cuba was responsible for assassinating JFK. But I thought the JFK assassination is still an unsolved mystery.

Officially speaking, the JFK assassination is not unsolved. A lone wolf gunman assassinated him. That's what the government says, at least, so demanding Cuba pay reparations for that would reveal a lot of previously hidden information. It would have been the largest government cover-up possibly in human history and would have massive implications across the board. The Biden Admin actually recently prevented the automatic declassification of documents related to the JFK assassination."
298,Why do people always see social media platforms as biased in favour of the political group opposed to them ?,"People have a tendency to view themselves as the center, even when they're not.

When you compound this tendency with being inside an echo chamber where the only opinions are those of people just like them, they tend to view anything that contradicts their vision of the center as being 'biased'.

With that in mind, those on the left are far more likely to misjudge the center than those on the right. Conservatives routinely interact with the liberal portions of the nation, while the reverse is not true. Virtually all entertainment media is presented from a liberal point of view and the tech industry is heavily slanted towards the extreme left.

Young people also tend to be far more likely to misjudge bias due to the fact that they have limited life experience - most particularly, limited life experience having to bear responsibility for others."
299,Why are seemingly similar Islamic fundamentalist organizations opposed to each other?,"ISI started out as the Al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq. When the Syrian Civil War was beginning, ISI sent some of its people into Syria to fight the Syrian Government and to help start up a new Al-Qaeda affiliate there - what eventually became Jabhat Al-Nusra. From 2013 - 2014, ISI took over territory in eastern Syria and western Iraq, and declared themselves the  Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. They requested that Jabhat Al-Nusra be absorbed into their own forces, which was opposed by both Jabhat Al-Nusra and the leadership of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda disowned ISIS, while several former Al-Qaeda affiliates and independent Islamist groups (such as Boko Haram) pledged their loyalty to ISIS."
300,What if a NATO Member declares war on a Non-NATO member?,NATO is defensive military alliance. They are not obligated to help in offensive wars.
301,How much carryover appeal is there from Sanders to DeSantis?,"I doubt there's much of any 'carryover appeal'.

Sanders almost exclusively appeals to far left progressives while DeSantis is seen by moderate Republicans as having strong track record. I suppose there's *someone* who would vote for both, but there aren't many such people."
302,Why would republicans vote against marriage equality?,"Religion is the reason, Christian Nationalism is on the rise in the US and Nationalism always needs an “outgroup” see African Americans, migrants, Muslims, Jews, and women. By using the out group they can rile their base into voting because “the right people” are being hurt. Also the current establishment does not represent the People rather that the rich have completely bankrolled US politics to a stand still, so rather than pass meaningful legislation republicans focus on controversial topics to subvert actual progress."
303,How do newly elected politicians learn how to do their job?,"Some would say they never learn how to do their job. On a serious note though, each member of Congress hires staffers who are paid (by the government, not by the elected official) to research, study, and handle all the paperwork side of the job. They actually write the legislation, read up on its potential effects, and have to know the law in and out. These staffers then provide the elected official with the pertinent information they need to make an informed vote."
304,What is the general status of funding for Public Schooling in the US?,"The fundamental problem with US primary education funding is that it’s based on local property taxes. So people who make $$$ buy $$$ houses and have $$$ schools. And people who make $ buy $ houses and have $ schools. 

It’s a structure that reinforces more inequality than any other. And it exists to varying degrees in every state. Trying to balance the scales is most of the federal education budget, but it’s never enough."
305,How realistic is the Three-State Solution for the Israel-Palestine Conflict today? (in 2022),"This doesn't work because the Palestinian nation doesn't understand itself to be members or Jordan or Egypt. Those nations taking control of the territory would just been seen as one foriegn occupation replaced with another. 

This might have worked 80 years ago. But there's been literally a life time of hardship that acted as a forge and created a strong sense of Palestinian nationhood."

307,How does left - right political diagram work?,"The left - right spectrum relates to the congress of the fist French republic.

On the left sat the revolutionary republicans, and on the right the reactionary monarchists.

And what does this represent? Simply said, the left is pro-egalitarianism, and the right is pro-hierarchy.

Of course there is a lot to be said about this, but yeah, that's the gist of things.

That's the only thing the left - right spectrum is good for, knowing on which side of the 'hierarchy vs. egalitarianism' debate an ideology or person stands."
308,"In the U.S, who can investigate an executive department? And why?","Outside of every executive level bureau and department's Office of the Inspector General, you also have the Government Accountability Office which exists under the legislative branch. 

The entire job of the GAO is to eliminate waste, fraud, and corruption inside the federal government."
309,Can a US president change what political party they're in once elected?,Yes. There is no law that requires the President to maintain a party identity. Congress could certainly respond to a President who ostensibly committed fraud against voters. There is really no reason to change parties though because a President isn't required to take action based on party affiliation. They could just take whatever action they wanted and avoid the issue of formally announcing a party switch.

312,What happens to government when it is on recess?,"Laws don't get passed during the recess. To be clear, the government being on recess pretty much only includes the legislative and judicial branches, and then only the elected officials. The President and all the Executive departments are still functioning. All the services and functions of government continue to operate. The legislature is just not in session at the time.

If there's an emergency which requires immediate legislative attention they can and have cut recesses short in the past."
313,"How would McMullin winning in Utah affect the balance of the senate? As in, what party would he count to a majority for?","There's no official total for independents to ""count"" towards. In the media you will usually hear the Sanders and King referred to as ""independents who caucus with the Democrats."" I assume McMullin would be an ""independent who caucuses with the Republicans."" His independent status seems to be purely for an anti-Trump show as his political positions are pretty much the standard GOP positions."

317,Why did Biden meet MBS even though he said he would make them a pariah after Jamal Khashogshis killing?,"A few reasons:

1. To try to convince Saudi Arabia to increase oil production (to help lower global oil and gas prices).

2. To establish a relationship with a leader (MBS) for a country which whom the US has strained relations, but who is still a strategic security partner in the region.

3. To encourage normalization between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Israel, which might eventually lead to participation in the regional air defense cooperation and generally better economic and diplomatic relations with the United States' closest ally in the Middle East.

There are likely other considerations as well, including the rising threats of China and Russia, the war in Yemen, boxing in Iran, etc.

I'm not arguing that the trip necessarily secured any of those goals or was smart to undertake (and I am certainly not defending the fist bump, which has been a public relations coup for MBS), but those are some of the underlying reasons for the trip. In short: geopolitical and domestic priorities seem to have trumped the moral repugnancy with which Biden views MBS."
318,Where is Putin getting all his enforcers?,"An inconvenient true for many anti-Russia people is that Putin is actually well-liked in the country.

After the fall of the USSR people like Yeltsin committed a coup, attacked parliament with tanks, destroyed the entire economy, etc. The ordinary Russians see Putin as the guy that put a stop to these things.

Yes, this entire 'fight' between the west and Russia has caused an economic decline for the Russian people. But they are still better off then 15 years ago. That's what we also forget: After everything that has happened, the quality of life for the average Russian has gone up.

One thing you can always look at is the average life expectancy! Right before the collapse of the USSR it was nearly 70, then it got lower to 65 and under Putin it went back to 73 years. For the US, for comparison, it has stagnated. 

So yeah, to sum it up: Putin has a lot of support. And people who don't like Putin, like the opposition in Russia, hate Putin less then they hate the idea of having a western puppet as their ruler. They oppose Putin but they don't want to throw the country into a civil war."
319,Why has the GOP not changed it's views on abortion in the recent decades?,"Abortion access is popular at the national level, but american politics doesn't work like that. In red states, restricting abortion is very popular. In blue states, it isn't. There are more blue voters than red voters, but local representation is very important (more states are red, although they have less people).

Additionally, people often overestimate how much support there is for abortion. Since something like 90% of all abortions happen in the first few weeks, one could answer ""Abortion should be legal in most cases"" and yet support banning abortion after 10 weeks -- those two are not contradictory at all. Very, very few people support third trimester elective abortions.

Another factor is how much people care for a given issue. Even if 60% of people in a given state were pro choice and only 40% pro life, it could still be more electorally viable to be pro life if those 40% are hardcore evangelicals who care about abortion above all else while those 60% care more about maintaining a low inflation or unemployment rate. There are levels of support beyond what your preference is (i.e.how much you prefer it)."
320,Why is Trump referred to differently than other presidents?,"I don't know that this is true beyond observational bias.

All former presidents are referred to as ""President"" but that's a convention that's diminished somewhat in the age of mass media. 

It might be deference in the sense that Trump trades heavily on his last name and he has a known pattern of [disliking being referred to by his first name.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/16/it-seems-that-donald-trump-doesnt-really-like-being-called-the-donald/) One of the ""strategies"" that Clinton employed during the 2016 debates was to constantly refer to him by his first name as a way to irritate him and make him lash out.

I think it also depends on *where* you're reading/hearing it. An outlet that's a little more pro-Trump (or caters to a pro-Trump audience) is likely going to lean more into the ""President Trump"" versus an outlet with a less positive outlook on him might be more inclined to use ""Mr."" to drive home the fact that he lost the 2020 election and is no longer the president."
321,Could there be a constitutional caliphate operated on democratic principles?,"In past centuries, the position of the Caliph has acted as a ceremonial figurehead, much like the Queen of England does today. Historically, Caliphs were also chosen through a process of communal consultation, which is democratic in nature.

The real challenge comes from Islam being a core piece of a caliphate. Technically, while the Queen is the head of the Church of England and the Church of England is enmeshed in English tradition and government (e.g. the Church has representation within the House of Lords), English society at large is not technically bound by any laws or decrees of the Church. (We could argue that, indirectly or de facto, English society is greatly influenced by the morals and teachings of the Church since the two evolved together and shaped the kingdom into modern society, etc...)

In short, it doesn't take that much imagination to envision a Caliphate ruled by a ceremonial figurehead that is closely associated with the Islamic religion in terms of societal traditions and culture, but that is -- like England -- more or less a full democracy. The Islamism, the Caliph, etc. would be trappings of an otherwise modern society governed by democratic norms and a constitution."
322,"(USA) If Social Security were to die or ""run out of money"" what would be the most likely cause?","Social Security is funded from a trust fund that your taxes pay into. It's estimated the surplus of this fund will run out in a few decades. Worst case scenario, if no proactive steps are taken, the surplus will disappear and benefits will have to be paid only out of current tax revenue. Which is estimated to be enough to pay at least 70% of benefits.

However, I think it is important to note that Social Security is a program of the Federal government, and as such, can always be funded, either through taxation or deficit spending. As Alan Greenspan, former Fed Reserve Chair, put it when asked by Paul Ryan about the long-term solvency of SS (I'm paraphrasing a bit here): there is no solvency issue, in that there is nothing to prevent the government from spending new money and issuing it to something. That question is, how do you build an economy that ensures that the real resources - housing, food, etc - are there which those benefits are meant to employ.

Put another way, the Federal Government as a whole can never be one insolvent. It can never be forced to default on its debt; it can always spend more, and it can always issue more debt in the process, as we have seen very clearly with recent events. But if we are not producing enough real resources - enough gas, enough housing, enough bread and butter - then people will be unable to buy those things regardless of whether or not the government sends them a check. This could be thanks to local supply shortages - if what they want is simply not available to be purchased - or, more realistically, it could simply be in the form of increased inflation, where they can't buy as much as they used to/as much as they expected to be able to.

Social Security is a policy choice to allot real resources to our seniors through the fiscal system. We tax some people so they can buy less, and give money to seniors so they can buy more. The government can always do this as much as the want. The real question, again, is how do we make sure that we have enough of the things everybody needs to live happy and productive lives? It is real resources which are scarce in this world; from the government's perspective, the money is the last thing it needs to worry about having, because it CREATES the money. The money is merely a tool for allocating limited real resources."
323,Does the US have military bases in South America?,"Beyond panama U.S mostly had no strategic interest in South America until the Cold War era & the Socialist scare. U.S had entire countries with Dictatorships/ military control aligned & willing to mobilize militarily against perceived threats to U.S interest. Operation condor history shows how they trained/ advised directed & operated clandestinely in region. The Panama base is the Southern command of the Military, the regional base. The U.S military operates mostly through training & supplying of local militaries. There are U.S ran military schools/ training centres. Countries are committed to common regional security goals making actual bases unnecessary."
324,Are countries allowed to join NATO while currently involved in a military conflict with another country?,"The rules in NATO basically state that in order for a country to be accepted it cannot have disputed borders or in armed open conflict. 

These rules are specifically there to prevent escalation and drawing the alliance into conflicts. NATO is a peace organization meant to prevent escalation of war.... not to be apart of it or a contributor."
325,"In the US, could abortion be madea county-level issue?","US conservatives might argue for local control in theory, but their political class do not abide by this principle in practice. A good example of this would be Florida's conservative state government suing the federal government for establishing regulation on mask use but then establishing state-level bans on local governments setting their own policy on the issue.

US conservatives argue that this is a state issue because they want their state-level governments to be able to ban it, not because they have some abstract interest in allowing more freedom for more polities and smaller to decide."
326,What Would You Say are Some Touchstone Features of Being a Dictator?,"A dictator is somebody whose political survival depends on the support of a relatively small fraction of the population.  With some dictators such as Kim Jong Un, we're talking about less than 1% of the population.  Xi Jinping's survival in power depends on the support of the Communist Party elite.

For comparison, a democratic leader is somebody who needs the support of a broad section of the population to survive in power.  Emmanuel Macron won the last French election with 18,768,639 votes, which is about 36% of France's adult population.

Dictators tend to survive longer in power that democratic leaders provide they survive the first few risky years of consolidation."
327,Would passage of the Equal Rights Amendment create a viable pathway to reinstitute a federal right to an abortion?,"Let's start with ERA. While you'll find no shortage of people attempting to claim it's been ratified, the Courts aren't likely to support that interpretation since it requires you to effectively ignore the text that was ratified. That's the real reason Biden hasn't said ""do it"" (and why no President will).

Even if it did somehow come back, it wouldn't actually do anything. The ERA provides no additional protection beyond what the Equal Protection Clause does. Despite what some proponents argue, it does not force the Courts to apply strict scrutiny to sex-related issues. It just repeats the language used in the Equal Protection Clause. Remember, it was written back in the 1920s before the concept of differing levels of scrutiny even existed. It should come as no shock that it's been rendered obsolete by subsequent jurisprudence.

Now, the existing Equal Protection Clause has been argued as a basis for a 'right to abortion', but the federal courts have never really supported this notion. Nor does it seem likely they will in the near future.

Ultimately, when you look at the 'will of the people', there's a clear majority that supports abortion laws more restrictive than those permitted under Roe v. Wade or Casey. As long as that is the case - and it doesn't show any signs of changing any time soon - the 'right to abortion' is almost certainly dead and buried. Instead, you'll have either the states or the federal government legislatively creating rules about what abortions are legal and what are not."
328,Is ELECTIVE socialized medicine being proposed at all in the US?,"Yes, this is an idea in the political discourse. When you hear people talking about a “public option,” they’re talking about an optional government-run health insurance plan (as opposed to “single-payer,” which is a mandatory government-run health insurance plan)."
329,Is there a mainstream media network that a majority of people would consider unbias or the least biased?,"It sounds like you're focusing on a TV network, and no, there aren't any that are worth your time. It's not usually a matter of bias that makes them so bad--CNN isn't really all that biased. The real issue with TV news is that it is not really formatted in a way to reliably learn valuable information, but is rather designed to provoke shallow discussion and emotional responses.

Talk shows and news anchors are basically the worst way to learn political stuff. Keeping up to the minute on stuff that's happening does not allow for an evidence based, structural view of politics. That kind of stuff doesn't get good ratings, and stuff that provokes outrage does. News TV doesn't suck because they're too hopelessly biased. It sucks because they set poor agendas and ask dumb questions and interview people the wrong people and that creates hopelessly partisan environments because those get viewers to tune in consistently.

If you want good sources for what's gong on, a professor or university poli sci department would tell you to read books written by political scientists. Beyond that, read quality newspapers, but not opinion or news content as much as the deep-dive investigative reporting. News is far less important than most people think it is. There's a lot of motion in politics but not a lot of that motion is actually going anywhere and being able to separate signal from noise is a very important skill to learn."

331,Could Someone Explain Why Universal Basic Income Wouldn't Create a Positive Feedback Loop?,"So it's important to remember two things when it comes to UBI. I'm not an expert in the proposal (because it was generally dead in the water when it was announced in the US).

The first is UBI is slated to replace some forms of welfare. So instead of the US also paying for food stamps, housing assistance, etc. all these welfare initiatives to help the poor, this would instead be replaced by UBI. So part of the UBI expense is being offset by removing other forms of welfare.

The second is, assuming UBI is being paid for with taxes beyond the above welfare amount, rich people won't actually see any UBI (in practicality). Let's take a person who makes $1 million a year. They may get the $1k a month check, but their taxes go up $2k a month to help fund the state welfare system (namely, UBI). So no EVERYONE would see the $1k/month, and instead see rising taxes on higher earners to offset the UBI. Of course this assumes a somewhat ""stable"" national debt, and YMMV based on the particular government/party running the show based on the political winds at the time.

But the same issue you're pointing out here could be the same issue for any welfare program, and it hasn't seemed to be an issue yet."
332,What is the purpose of executive privilege?,"Of course! We mostly only hear about the dramatic uses of executive privilege, but there are many day-to-day things the president discusses or communicates with his staff that's better kept private. That's not necessarily a bad thing. For example, imagine if every bit of communication within the executive branch regarding foreign policy was accessible by the public. That...would be a very bad thing for complicated negotiations between countries that already have some tension with the US. Even on purely domestic matters, there is lots of value in being able to do your job knowing discarded ideas won't be brought up to drag your team through the mud. Lots of policy choices involve tradeoffs, and honestly there's value in being able to discuss that in purely utilitarian terms that only privacy can allow.

And for what it's worth, executive privilege does NOT allow to cover up corruption or lawbreaking. US v. Nixon established quite clearly that executive privilege is protected in the Constitution via separation of powers, but that it does not apply in cases of law breaking. Ultimately, individuals who use it like Trump uses it will lose in Court. There's just a bit of a process to get there, and often the folks asking him for things don't want to delay their investigation the amount of time it would take to defeat Trump's claims in court."

334,If federal circuit court judges are appointed by Presidents then why are the circuit courts so reflective of their local politics?,"A few reasons:

Back in the day (though much less today), Presidents relied on the members of Congress of both parties to recommend judges for their districts and circuits.  That’s the “advice” in “advice and consent.”  So conservative Senators from conservative states will recommend more conservative judges.  Home state Senators also used to (but in the last couple of years stopped) have the ability to single-handedly block or significantly delay judicial nominees in their state.  So, for instance, Ted Cruz could aggressively block Obama nominees in Texas in a way he couldn’t in California. 

That’s how it started.  Also, lawyers who are in the running for judgeships typically live in areas that match their political beliefs.

It perpetuates because of strategic retirement.  Conservative judges won’t retire during the Biden administration, etc.  So, liberal seats stay liberal and conservative seats stay conservative, unless a president fails to make an appointment, or someone dies."
335,How does rebuilding a country after a war work?,"A very good book on this topic is *Life in the Emerald City* by Rajiv Chandrasekaran. It talks about the US's attempt to rebuild Iraq, specifically contrasting that effort against their good track record in Germany and Japan after WW2. I'd recommend that as a good starting point.

Unfortunately, there isn't really a short answer to your question. It depends on the laws of the country in question, their international relationships, their desire or need for political/social/economic reform, and more. Basically, sometimes, yes, the government will just build a new one. Sometimes they won't. It depends on all those things."
336,What is the SCOTUS case Moore V. Harper?,"So the lawsuit comes down to the interpretation of a clause in the Constitution.

In particular, this case comes down to the phrase about holding elections:

>The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereo...

So previously, states can (and did) impose requirements on how the state legislatures do business. For example, some states require that any district lines drawn for Congress be signed by the governor, or the state courts can overturn districts that go against the state Constitution.

The case at play here was from the 2021 North Carolina redistricting based on the 2020 census results. The state legislature created new maps that were ""gerrymandered"" to give the Republicans more power in the state. The Democrats in the state sued, and the NC Supreme Court ruled the maps inadmissible as violating the state Constitution for ""equal power of each person's voice"".

The Republicans are challenging that by saying the phrase from the Constitution gives the state legislatures, and the legislatures alone, the power to decide how elections are operated and develop maps without any other state interference. They claim neither the Executive Branch nor Judicial Branch of North Carolina are Constitutionally allowed to overrule the Legislative Branch on how elections are operated.

Note that what this would mean would be based on what exactly SCOTUS writes in their opinions.

But if ruled without details, it would mean that state legislatures reserve the right to determine all election related operations, as long as they are in agreement with federal law. So state legislatures would be free to draw whatever districts they want and neither the Executive Branch (the governor) or the state Judicial Branch would be able to stop or interfere with them. From a general public perspective, it means the legislature will be able to determine all election laws and procedures without checks & balances from the rest of the state government. This would likely sway states with single-party legislatures to create rules, districts, and policies that favor their party, similar to gerrymandering now.

If given leeway, it also gives state legislatures a lot more freedom in how to decide who gets what votes from the state. For example, if the state legislature is the sole decider of election law, they could theoretically reject the popular vote of the state and give state electors to another candidate (for example, Arizona in 2020 could have given their electors to Trump instead of Biden).

Whether that would happen is yet to be seen, but if the ruling is in favor of the Republicans here, it gives the state legislatures unilateral power to control elections in their state in accordance with federal law.

If the Democrats win the lawsuit, everything proceeds as it has for the history of our country, where state laws and actions by the state legislatures are still subject to Executive and/or Judicial Branch checks and balances."
337,Who are these people behind the president during the transition of power?,"The following was passed after the Kennedy assassination.  

> [Presidential Transition Act Summary](https://presidentialtransition.org/publications/presidential-transition-act-summary/)

The GSA is in charge of some of the details, but the president is responsible for appointing up to 4,000 executives that run the government."
338,How is the legal argument behind Independent State Legislature Doctrine any different from the National Proportional Vote Interstate Compact?,"I think that the constitution is clear here, the state legislatures shall direct and appoint electors. The key difference, however, is that the Napovointerco (look up CGP Grey he's awesome) seeks to cast it's votes with the majority of the nation at large, even if it means ignoring how the people of that state vote. The other doctrine you refer to is a fringe reading that says state legislatures have all the say in all matters regarding how federal elections in that state happen. This is not true, the constitution is quite clear that the federal government has authority, in many cases, over how federal elections are done. At the end of the day however, the states are the ones that ultimately run the elections and print all the ballots. Now, this ISLD doctrine is very much a conservative cop out, to put it mildly, to say that federal laws regarding voter rights and gerrymandering and so on are invalid, which again is not true, but the courts may not see it that way given that the constitution doesn't say what exactly the federal government can regulate about the election process. It has always been interpreted to have a wide meaning granting congress a wide range of powers to expand voter access where states have traditionally denied it (barring federal or state constitutional amendments)."
339,Can Congress and POTUS defund the SCOTUS?,"This would essentially tear down the federal judiciary. These cases like Dobbs with such  size and ramifications are far and few. The federal judiciary also includes run of the mill immigration appeals and bankruptcy cases, employment discrimination cases, diversity cases, etc. Most courts everywhere are already overworked. 

But, too answer your question, yes. Congress can decrease the funding of the federal judiciary. Judges are guaranteed constitutional protection for their pay in that their pay can never be diminished while in office. So, the jobs lost or with reduced pay will be court staff and staff attorneys. 

Dems are also not “rattling the saber of shifting funding priorities” because the ramifications are clear in that it would just cause decreased court efficiency and longer cases for litigants and the accused."
340,"When Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, why did it stop at making fairly small gains, instead of going for a regime change or a complete annexation of Georgia?","Why should it? It accomplished its goals. It expanded those two regions, ensures they were beyond reproach, eliminated NATO interest in Georgia, set a precedent for others like Ukraine and Moldova, and did so with artillery and missiles instead of a large scale invasion. It did this in the lame duck era of Bush, and pretty much escaped major punishment. Meanwhile Russian support increased as he was maneuvering around term limits as prime minister soon and then president again."

343,When did anti-abortionism become a major political issue in the US?,"There are lots of articles out there talking about the history. 

Just start with wiki.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_anti-abortion_movement

There were various abortion bans on the books in many states and it was not a top issue for most. The issue becomes supercharged after Roe. 

Catholics especially bishops were against abortion always. Becomes a top political priority after Roe. 

No big political successes until the Reagan Revolution. Catholics somehow find common ground with evangelicals on the abortion issue. A political coalition is born taking over Republican politics and enacting policies. 

For those not Christian, Catholics and evangelicals are not naturally friends. It may seem so today, but for hundreds of years lots of bad blood. Strange bedfellows politics makes and it has kept up for 40 years."

345,Why Macedonia is being bullied by Greece and Bulgaria?,"Don’t have a dog in this fight but found the history interesting. 

> The dispute arose from the ambiguity in nomenclature between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute

346,"What does it mean for a SC candidate to be ""under oath"" in their hearing?","Potential Supreme Court justices testify before the Senate judiciary committee during their nomination hearings. They take this oath before every hearing: “Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?”

If anyone agreeing to this oath lies to Congress or any committee, then they could be charged with federal perjury by the justice department."
347,What countries surprisingly don’t have “freedom of speech” and what’s the difference in experience from the US?,"The UK doesn't have a written constitution, so its speech protections are only by statute, meaning the parliament can change it with a simple majority vote. Their statutory speech protections are also much more limited than the US's 1st Amendment protections. There have been many cases of people being arrested and jailed/fined in the UK for posting ""offensive"" words on Twitter, for example.

There are several countries in Europe that will jail you for denying that there was a mass killing of Jews during WW2, or for giving a Nazi salute or possessing Nazi literature, or many other things.

In the US, the only types of speech that aren't protected by the First Amendment are:

* conspiracy to commit a crime (must include the target, the type of crime, and a certain degree of specificity about time and place),

* intentional lying that causes reputational or physical harm to someone, or defrauds them (i.e. libel/slander, shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded room to cause a stampede when you knew there was no fire, making false claims about a product you're selling, etc.)

* perjury,

* sharing state secrets, or giving helpful info to an enemy during wartime."
348,Do polling places have to stay open if people are still in line to vote?,"This varies by state and even by county and city. But generally, yes. At the very least, voters still in line should be able to cast provisional ballots and their validity can be determined later."
349,Wouldn’t Congressional action providing a right to abortion be overturned by SCOTUS using the exact same logic of Dobbs?,"No, because Dobbs wasn't talking about legislation, but unenumerated rights.  The reasoning was that there was no legitimate source for abortion being a right. If Congress passed that law, it would be that source"
350,Why is the house so much harder for the democrats to defend then the Senate?,"2 year election cycles make the house more vulnerable to political whims. And like others said, gerrymandering makes for disproportionate power of rural voters. So if the rural vote rolls out, it will bring more Republicans into the house. Some of that has to do with how energized vs apathetic the voters are at a current time period, which is why I believe we so often see a backlash against a presidents party at midterms."
351,What was the Supreme Court’s reasoning behind the ruling that the due process clause does not apply to abortion?,"The public has access to all information about this (textbooks are easily obtainable and all Supreme Court and other legal opinions are available for nothing, or virtually nothing)… but, there’s a reason a legal education costs an arm and a leg. It’s complex.

The long and the short of it is that “substantive due process” has been considered a flimsy concept in legal circles for a long time. Due process is generally considered to be a procedural issue.. But, that doesn’t excuse the SC from what they did. They overturned 50 years of precedent to take away an established right. It’s never been done."
352,Where can I get information about a specific tax credit?,Probably ask that specific grocer? The IRS or a local accountant may be able to shed some light on this.
353,How far-right can you get?,"The origin of the left-right political spectrum comes from the French Revolution. When the National Assembly moved to Paris (from Versailles) they met in a large hall with stadium-style seating along the two sides (think kind of like a high school basketball court). Members of the Assembly organically chose to sit with other like-minded members. Those members who supported the absolutist monarchy sat on the right side while those who wanted a republican constitution sat on the left.

In very broad sense, the farther right you go fewer people hold political power. The farther left you go more people hold political power. As you noted, the farthest left you can get is anarchism, in which everyone holds equal political power by dint of there not being a centralized power structure. The extreme opposite would be an absolutist monarchy/dictatorship in which a single individual holds all political power."
354,"In the time leading up to Marbury v. Madison, congress instructed the Supreme Court to take a year off because representatives were concerned with how the court might decide the case. Would something like that be possible now?","Yes, but it would require 60 votes in the Senate to bypass the filibuster."
355,Do American citizens have the ability to see where their tax dollars are going?,"First of all, I think it's important to note that taxes don't really ""pay for"" spending strictly speaking. The Congress decides how much it wants to tax and how much it wants to spend, but those things don't necessarily need to go together. In fact, the government in the US almost always spends more than it taxes (which we call deficit spending).

The Congressional Budget Office, among other groups, keeps track of the spending that the federal government does. Very broadly speaking, spending is often put into three groups: entitlement spending, which includes social security, Medicare and Medicaid; defense spending, which is all things military; and ""discretionary spending"", which is basically everything else.

Entitlements and discretionary spending are, for the most part, pretty easy to track. The black hole is defense spending. For obvious reasons, the military and state security agencies do not want to publicize all the things they spend money on. Even the people who should have oversight often cannot account for the amount of money spent.

Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of defense under George Bush, stated early in the administration that his department could not account for roughly 2.3 trillion in military spending. The date that he said that? September 10, 2001. Needless to say, the events of the following day overshadowed this news, and instead of demanding more accountability from the defense department, we began shoveling in tremendous amounts of money in order to fight two foreign wars. So if there is an issue with transparency in spending, our military (and state security agencies like CIA, FBI, NSA, etc) is far and away the biggest culprit."
356,How influential are Ben Garrison cartoons?,"I’m fairly certain you would need to be already in that rabbit hole to find these cartoons funny, if even anyone does.  Its impossible for me to believe an average, moderate person could look at one of these and not be confused and repulsed.

I’ve also never seen one in the real world and think that is probably true of almost everyone."
357,The UK has a site that aggregates and tracks parliamentary voting history. Does the US have a similar site?,I think this might be what you would be looking for: https://www.congress.gov/roll-call-votes
358,Can today's Roe v Wade ruling be reversed in the future?,"It's ""reversible"" in that the supreme court in the future could make a decision that makes abortion access a national right again. Decisions have to be made in response to a case that's been run through lower courts up to SCOTUS. This specific case is closed and the decision is final."
359,Do world leaders meet up for special dinners?,"Usually visiting world leaders stay longer than just a dinner, but yes. The time that leaders spend on such tours is usually a mix of foreign policy discussions/negotiations and leisure (golfing, skiing, whatever makes the negotiations go smoother).

Different kinds of world leaders usually have different objectives when they go abroad. A head of state, such as the Emperor of Japan, will mostly engage in cultural exchange and symbolic acts (many heads of state don't have much say over policy, so they act as figureheads). A head of government, such as the Prime Minister of Iraq, may focus more on policy (trade, defense, foreign aid, etc). Someone who is both head of state and head of government, such as the President of the United States, will often do a mix of both."
360,What is the specific legal logic in overturning Roe vs. Wade Ruling? Fourth Amendment: Protects the right of privacy against unreasonable searches and seizures by the government,"The right to privacy here was built out of the fourteenth amendment. Basically, there’s a clause which says the states cannot abridge any rights of citizens in the same way that the federal government couldn’t prior. Roe vs. Wade (and a couple others mentioned by Justice Thomas) was directed as a challenge to state abortion laws, therefore part of the legal strategy was a fourteenth amendment appeal to the Supreme Court. 

At the time this legal strategy was built inside a framework surrounding a right to privacy that other cases established (e.g. Griswold v. Connecticut). The court’s majority opinion, as I understand it, essentially says this right doesn’t apply to abortion. 

As far as your connection to the fourth amendment argument, that would be a question for an attorney. I’m not sure if the legal strength of that argument or if it could work. That argument was not a basis for the original ruling and thus would have to be brought by another case and decided in that way by the court.

Quick sources (I have an academic one on the right to privacy if anyone is curious, but I’m on a phone and generating a citation would be difficult to say the least. 😂)

361,"Wouldn't a federal abortion law be constitutional, and effectively reinstate Roe v. Wade?","I don't know that your specifics are completely correct, but broadly speaking, yes, we could indeed pass federal legislation that protects abortion rights. Federal law does trump state law unless there is some other legal issue, so in a very simple sense, yes, this would work.

As to why it isn't being done, well, they actually did try. After the draft opinion was released, the Dems put forward a bill that would have codified abortion protections into law. The bill never even got to a vote because the Reps filibustered it.

And THAT's the crux of the issue. The reason we don't just solve these problems with federal law right now is because passing meaningful federal law is impossible thanks to our anti-majoritarian structures. This is EXACTLY why the Framers warned specifically against a filibuster mechanic. We don't pass bills because we can't pass bills because all it takes is vocal minority to oppose something and it's completely dead. That's where we are with your proposal."
362,Can Supreme Court Justices be Impeached?,"Constitutionally, yes. But it would require at least 17 Republican Senators to convict, so it'll never happen."
363,"If Democrats were to somehow achieve the required Senate majority and pass a federal abortion rights law, how likely would the Supreme Court be to strike that down too?","It's unclear. Several of the justices who overturned Roe v Wade mentioned that they believe it should be up to elected officials and government to make the call, but it's entirely possible that the federal government creating such a law would run afoul of their intentions and they'd find some reason to say only states can create such laws."

366,Why is Juul and E-cigarettes being banned but real cigareetes not being banned when they have been studied to have a larger risk?,"Regarding your edit, this isn't Juul getting banned because it is new. The FDA would love to treat all nicotine products equally, but they probably literally can't because when the law governing regulation of nicotine products were written, vapes didn't exist and so the law wasn't written with language broad enough to anticipate the invention of vapes. The whole point is that vapes *aren't* regulated nearly as much as cigarettes because the law just hasn't adjusted yet to this new invention, so the FDA is legally bound to approach this in a different way.

This is why legislating can't just be a neutral, zero sum game as the default. We need to be able to pass laws without having enormous campaigns to attract well beyond majority support because that's how we have folks address things like this. This isn't near the top of anyone's priority list, for good reason, and the reality is that getting stuff like this fixed just tends not to happen when majoritarian principles aren't followed in your government."
367,Isn't the EU practically a federation?,"No. For two main  reasons

1) Every member state maintains independent foreign and defense policies. They all maintain bilateral relations with non-member states separately, sign treaties and engage in military operations independently. Some of them are NATO members and others are not for instance. 

2) The EU has very little power to enforce EU law on member-states if the member state doesn't want to cooperate. The EU can set monetary policy and some trade policies, but on all other issues the EU essentially works on consensus. If a single-member state opposes something it doesn't happen. If a member-state does end up violating an EU policy or law, again they have very little they can do. Think about what happens if an American state defies the federal government. When southern states refused to follow the ruling of Brown v. BoD, the federal government sent in the national guard to force schools to integrate. If an EU member state violates an EU policy, the EU can basically consider withholding funds, and that's about it."

Adsuming we couldn't just make a policy that clears those difficult hurdles (and we might, I'm just assuming) then we need a proxy: some other category besides out of state landlord, that nonetheless prevents the conduct we don't like."
370,How do I stop my email from being used by political parties without my permission?,"Sounds like it is a case of someone else submitting your email address without your knowledge.

You can try one of the following:

1) Submit a request of removal of your address to their mailing lists.

2) Build a filter in your email to auto delete the unwanted mail

3) Get a new email address.

Because you have no idea who is leaking your email address to these lists, not much you can do.

I myself have multiple email addresses for different uses.  Some are linked to services/bills.  Some are for friends and family communication.  One is work only.  Several are throw away addresses that I can use for if someone wants my email and I have not confirmed if they are trust worthy.  If those accounts fill up with spam I have a reasonable idea of where it came from and I just shutdown that address and start a new one.

I use a password manager and an email application on my PC to track what is what and keep it all on lockdown."
371,Doesn’t SCOTUS ruling against Roe V. Wade essentially conflict with the 9th Amendment?,"The Ninth Amendment, in spite of its language, is very limited in it's scope.  The broad reading you're thinking of would give more or less limitless causes of action for anything not already in the Constitution."
372,What is going on with the rail strike in the UK?,"In very broad and simpler terms, a combination of labour shortages, supply chain disruption, post-COVID rebound economics, and post-Brexit trade problems have led to massive spikes in inflation (9% in the UK, expected to be 11%) and cost of living rises in the UK. Additionally, especially around COVID, the national government invested heavily into British railways to basically pay them fixed fees to keep running services - despite reduced ridership (and also at risk to workers). Ridership has not recovered still to pre-pandemic levels (actually at roughly 1/5th of pre-pandemic levels). 

In the face of all of that, rail workers were proposed a 2% raise in wages (and a 2% raise in wages, against 9-11% inflation, that means most workers would actually be facing effectively a reduction in wages in terms of actual purchasing power). And given reduced ridership, it was proposed to cut a number of personnel to reduce costs. 

So the rail workers went on strike to demand better. 

It's not all related to Brexit obviously. Inflation has been hitting most countries following COVID and now especially with the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (both massive hits in particular for energy and agriculture costs globally). That being said, Brexit has had some impact. But in discussing economic impact, it's never as simple as this was responsible for x percentage of this versus this having x percentage impact."
373,How has the Jan 6th incident directly affected the everyday American?,"We the public can deal with any bad decisions that our politicians make, more or less, because we have the option to change things around in our leadership later if we don't like it, or if it gets bad enough.

Not so if they start messing around with proper transfer of power after they're voted out, or dismantling that process completely. Once that goes, there is no longer a peaceful way for the public to make changes in their governance, and things will get dangerous real quick."
374,Can new Constitutional rights be created?,"The constitution can be amended. It requires two actions: 1) 2/3 of both houses must approve the amendment and then 3/4 of the states must approve the amendment for it to be effective. The amendment could add additional ‘rights’ as referenced.

Also, after the amendment passed it likely would have to pass SCOTUS review IF there was conflict with another part of the Constitution."
375,"ELI5: If the Republicans gain one or more Senate seats in the upcoming election, what will happen for the next two years? What will they be able to accomplish / pass / block with a simple majority but a Democrat controlled House and WH? What will the Democrats still be able to accomplish?","Essentially, they will be able to block *everything* and pass *nothing.* Biden will have to govern exclusively by executive authority. 

The main thing that a Senate majority will give Republicans, besides stopping all legislation in its tracks, is the ability to hold symbolic votes on whatever right-wing cause they want, without any consequences because those laws will never make it past the house or the veto. 

I will say though that it's far more likely that Democrats keep the Senate and lose the house, just because of which senate seats are up right now."
376,Is there a term for when a political movement occurs in demographically similar countries at the same time? Any literature on why this happens?,"To be really simple, political movements are effects and effects come from causes. In countries that are similar, the causes are often similar, and so the effects are often similar. It's very important to understand that politics is structural--when you have certain conditions, they contribute to certain outcomes, and while politics is far from deterministic, there is enough correlation that we can analyze situations for patterns and predict outcomes. 

Great ways to dive more deeply into this concept is to study comparative politics. There are about a hundred introductions to the topic of varying degrees of length and style. All of them are probably going to be fairly similar and worth a look. The one I read was a textbook called *Comparative Politics* by Clark, Golder, and Golder, and I'd recommend it. Another option for a very broad survey that talks a bit about this concept is *Why Nations Fail* by Robinson and Acemoglu."
377,what's the diference between a classical liberal and a libertarian?,"Libertarianism is an ideology that is also defined by its critical view of the state.  They just don't emphasize ""liberty"" but believe the state itself often has a negative impact on freedom.  The term itself was actually popularized by Anarchists, and wasn't picked up by free-market advocates until the 1960s in a blatant attempt to co-opt the term.  Also, not all libertarians support free market ideas and many are anti-capitalist, notably Anarchists."
378,What does Biden have to lose in regards to student loan forgiveness?,"1.	It could alienate anyone who paid off their student loans and are forced to deal with the impacts of the lack of repayment of the debt.
2.	Those with student loans are younger and don’t vote in large numbers, so they wont bother to vote even if he does this for them.
3.	There are legal questions if he can do it.
4.	. There is a budgetary cost.
5.	He can not forgive private student loans, so that will alienate those who will be ignorant of the difference."
379,Was the overthrow of Evo Morales a CIA coup? It seems to have backfired for them.,"No, Morales was overthrown by domestic forces with the police and military abandoning him being the point where he was pretty much done.  Most legitimate accusations against the USA isn't that we removed him personally, but that we waged a propaganda war that helped de-legitimized him and supported groups who were against him.  However, in situations like this the exact nature of USA involvement will probably not be known until decades later, if ever.

I should also note that the CIA doesn't actually do that many coups, despite popular belief, or at least they directly don't.  What generally happens is the American intelligence, military and related groups become friendly with certain groups within a country and help provide them with aid, and sorta let them do the dirty work.  In more involved situations, like the Allande situation, they will gladly wage an intelligence war and even offer funding of some sort but they generally do not have the actual ability to directly remove people and thus are very reliant on a local strong men to do that.  In some cases, like what happened in South Korea on two occasions, the domestic group will pretty much make their move without getting any input from the USA on the grounds that they are confident that they can ""apologize later."""
380,How are asian countries are affected by the whole us-china thing?,"Only those who trade with China and the US, or who are close enough to be affected by a potential shooting war between the two.

381,"In Public Opinion, Walter Lippman speaks about Patronage, but what exactly did patronage mean during his time?","Prior to Civil Service reforms in the 1880s, every single job in the federal government could be directly hired and fired by the President. So it wasn't a matter of giving people power so much as it was a source of giving people jobs. If you're a Republican and you become President, you're appointing a prominent town Republican to be the postmaster in every town and that person is hiring only Republicans to carry the mail. The same happened with state and local jobs, which created machines- you're a local leader, and you control x number of jobs cleaning the streets. People join your party to get those jobs, and voted your way to get better service from the city government. The more votes you controlled, the higher you would rise into state and then federal politics, becoming a governor or a Senator controlling directly or indirectly through your cronies nearly every government job in the state. Imagine if every government worker, from the mail carrier to the firefighters to the DMV clerk had to be party members in good standing. That's what the patronage system was."
382,How much of a threat is Iran?,"Iran has the ability to cause problems in their own region, but their power projection capabilities can't do much beyond their own back yard.  Their nuclear program is mostly about ensuring that they won't be invaded by the USA like their neighbor Iraq was.  So George W. Bush gave the Iranians quite the education of why to get the bomb."
383,ELI5: How is fascism anti-conservatism?,"Conservatives, by my simplest definition, supports tradition and resists change. William Buckley described conservatives as confronting progressives by hold up their hand and saying, ""Stop!"" In the US, conservatives are now known for favoring small government and unregulated capitalism. In Soviet Union, conservatives would, several generations after the revolution, support a government6controlled economy. Stalinists would be conservative in Soviet Union. 

Fascists talk about patriotism and the nation, but they want to overthrow the current government to establish a nationalist, authoritarian, less-democratic political system with a largely capitalist economic system."
384,How can I get initialized into the political sphere of reddit?,"Online political discussions are kind of sucky most of the time. Period. People act differently online, and even if they don't, the conversations are hard because you can't really respond to someone directly in real time like you can in a conversation. Even if you're going back and forth on a comment thread refuting each other word for word, you can't really force someone to go back and clarify a definition, or stay on the point, or anything like that. 

The best you can do is find a community that really values good faith. This sub is a good example where the questions asked and the answers given tend to be of fairly high quality. I've very active in other political subs where that's not nearly so true, unfortunately.

There's an abundant amount of evidence that the best place to talk politics is actually with other people in real life face to face conversations. That's uncomfortable for many, but really that's the clear best way to engage politically. Good luck."

386,"Will the ""Great Reshuffle"" transform demographics enough to change the calculus of gerrymandered districts?","The blue-to-red migrants are primarily the red residents of blue states. So what you're seeing is less of a re-shuffle than a sorting.

In terms of how it will affect gerrymandering, it probably won't. Racial gerrymanders will continue as they have before, as will political gerrymanders. The migration patterns are unlikely to affect the overall political balance of most states except in the sense of making the blue bluer and the red redder."
387,Is it possible to have a military that is not authoritarian?,Pirate ships were quite democratic.  The only time the captain had absolute power over the crew was in battle.
388,Is the Reichstag fire decree hypothetically possible in America?,"Sure. If enough people are determined to do something and there are too few people to stop them, words on a page don't mean a thing."
389,Why were 3 countries banned from this year's Summit of the Americas?,"The summit of the Americas is the annual conference of the Organization of American States, an international organization made up of the countries in North and South America.

The OAS was founded in 1948, 73 years before Biden became president.

It's kind of like the UN, but with a lower profile.  The main thing it does is election monitoring.

Nicaragua withdrew from the OAS:

Cuba is a member state but chooses to not participate:

>On June 3, 2009, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Americas adopted resolution AG/RES. 2438 (XXXIX-O/09), that resolves that the 1962 resolution, which excluded the Government of Cuba from its participation in the inter-American system, ceases to have effect in the Organization of American States (OAS). **The 2009 resolution states that the participation of the Republic of Cuba in the OAS will be the result of a process of dialogue initiated at the request of the Government of Cuba**, and in accordance with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS.

391,What sort of role do old money families play in politics today?,It's an interesting question. Who would be more interested in conserving wealth via hoarding and no taxes than a family who's source of productivity ran out generations ago?
392,Why do certain policy-relevant fields of expertise (foreign policy and economics especially) appear monopolized by right wing groups and talking points - in spite of the stereotype of left wing/liberal hegemony in academia and journalism?,"Not an expert here but I think there are 2 general answers that might help.

1. US specific answer: The Cold War pushed US culture, politics, and academia to the right, skewing the political spectrum (Overton window). There tend to be more left wing departments and fields of study outside of the US. For instance, quite a non US universities have programs in the study communism, which is very rare here.

2. General answer: the system will promote ideologies which support its status quo and vice versa. People who benefit from the status quo are those who currently hold power and influence, of course they will dominate the discussion, and continue to argue for these systems. This would likely also happen under say a communist system, where capitalist ideology would be fringe, although perhaps to a lesser degree due to a lack of market influence.

Also side note: as someone who has done academic research in public policy, almost no organization in the US is going to fund research against their usually purely capitalist interest."
393,"Would an Emperor Augustus-esque transition to a dictatorship be possible in today's time and if yes, how could it be achieved?","It happens all the time.  Russia, Hungary, the Philippines all come to mind as somewhere in this transition."
394,What would happen to a bill if it was presented in a previous Congress?,"Yes, that is exactly what would happen. Running out the clock on bills happens all the time. Sometimes this is gamesmanship--this way folks can avoid getting caught voting against a bill, or they can introduce legislation they have no intention to vote for, etc. Things like that. Other times it's just a matter of passing legislation is hard work and folks are actively trying to move it along but they just run out of time or it gets put behind other things of higher importance. There are probably 100 things that a Congressperson needs to work on but only enough time for 35 of them every single day."
395,What is 'nazification'?,"Nazification is just Nazis being in charge of the government. It's not a term anyone has ever used.

Denazification was the name for policies taken by the Allies (especially France, America, and  Britain). The USSR took part as well but was less interested) when they occupied Germany after World War II), who aimed to destroy support for Nazism and prevent Germany from being taken over again. 

This included;

*  Preventing people with ties to the Nazi regime, but not close enough to be arrested, from remaining or gaining power or influence in either government, business, or the cultural world. 
* Widely publicizing Nazi horrors to the German public, forcing Germans to watch the Nuremberg Trials, and taking Germans to see Concentration camps 
* Prohibiting the publication of Nazi ideas and sentiments. 

Similar efforts took place in either area of Allied occupation but with less intensity. 

Denazification largely ended when the U.S. decided they wanted a strong West Germany as a buffer between Western Europe and the USSR. 

Since then the term hadn't really been used until Putin revived it as his ad hoc justification for war. 

So if Denazification is taking steps to prevent Nazis or Nazi-like groups from taking power, Nazification is taking steps to make it possible for Nazis to take power. But again it's not a term anyone really uses."
396,Is Israel's neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war due to Ukraine's shootdown of Siberia Airlines Flight 1812?,"Israel does not 'bear grudges'. It's a luxury they cannot afford.

Israeli foreign policy is shackled by two realities.

First, they can't really afford to go around making unnecessary enemies. Picking sides in a Ukraine/Russia conflict does nothing for Israel. Neither side is likely to support Israel's interests out of gratitude in return.

Second, whenever Israel supports anything, it has enemies who will automatically oppose it. If Israel issued a statement expressing support for puppies and hugs, you'd hear certain parties insisting that puppies and hugs were the root of all evil in response. This means that sometimes the best form of support Israel can give is to say nothing at all."
397,"How come we're praying for Ukraine, but when Afghanistan was at war, we didn't pray for them?","There were plenty of people saying the pullback from Afghanistan was a bad idea, and I saw plenty of “Pray for Afghanistan” posts/imagery. The issue was it turned fully political - with the GOP saying the withdrawal was bad, and the Democrats saying it was good. All the thoughts about the Afghani people got sucked along with it.

Ukraine was a more unified response and you can say “pray for Ukraine” without one half of the people getting all upset about it."
398,Does working in a district office count as Hill experience?,"Lots of value in it. You're still a congressional employee or intern when you work in a district office. And a move to the hill later on is more of a reasignment than joining a new organization. You'll also get to know your boss' hill staff while you work back in the district, giving you even more connections in DC.

The hill office is usually focused on legislation and the district offices on constituent services, so there is a difference. But still a great opportunity if you want to make the move to DC one day."
399,Are we allowed to regulate ammunition?,"One is legal but a bad idea. We want gun owners to practice with their guns. 

Two would be unconstitutional because the courts have recognized a right to self defense, which requires a gun to be loaded."
400,"What does a country have to do to have a ""powerful passport""?","We can see some clues in a list of the world's strongest passports.

You'll notice the strongest passports are mostly rich and western aligned nations. In fact, of the 34 strongest passports, 33 are western aligned. (Or 32 of 34 if you dont want to count Switzerland as western aligned.) 

Our next clue is in what a strong passport is doing. The passport being strong means other countries want that countries citizen's to be able to visit very easily. 

This tells us that large amounts of the world want rich westerners to come visit, or are concerned about the ramifications of making it harder for rich westerners to come visit. 

Basically, most countries want the money that a European or, say, an American will bring with them when they come visit. They also want to allow ease of travel for citizen's to help with diplomatic relations. It's not very friendly to make it hard for a countries citizen's to stop by for a week. Most of the world wants good relations with the rich and powerful west, and the money their citizen's bring.

For a nation to strengthen its passport, it could choose to focus on making itself richer, and more aligned with the overlapping treaties that form the base of the western bloc's alliances. Alternatively. If it wanted to avoid big picture changes and just hyper focus on this topic, said nation could try to horse trade away things or rights in exchange for a foriegn power granting the country's citizens ease of travel. Maybe something like ""well invest 2 billion into your nation in exchange for a drop in the visa requirement."""
401,What is the Newtonian system of government?,"iirc, it’s less a specific slate of policies or a particular form of government, and more of an abstract ideal of balance according to simple, universally applied principles. In the way that Newtonian physics describes the movements of the celestial spheres just as well as a cart pulled by a horse or a brick thrown against a wall, a “Newtonian government” would similarly have a handful of simple laws that would contain and order the world of farmers and kings alike."
402,Can some people give examples of animals engrained in Us Political Culture?,[deleted]
403,Why is Russia so prone to dictatorship?,"Democracies happen slowly and gradually, and remain only when their economies and institutions are strong in the long run. Russia, despite its status as a world power, is a rather poor country. Half of its people make less than $5500 a year. Its history has been one of famine, theft and autocracy. The collapse of communism, while doing away with much of state's direct control over people, also contributed to widespread shortages of food and other commodities. Such desperation breeds competition for power and wealth, increasing the likelihood of bribery, embezzlement and coups."
404,How do other countries with widespread military-grade firearms ownership avoid the problem of mass shootings?,"All of those countries require you to have a license to own and carry a gun (which most states in the U.S. do not require)

Israel, Finland, and Switzerland all have (near) universal conscription which means that everyone is fully trained to use a gun safely in the military. 

 In order to get a permit in NZ, you need a ""lawfull purpose"" for using a firearm, which cannot include self-defense. You also need to take a written test, have two references, and undergo a mental health evaluation"
405,Why can’t we treat U.S. States as a hostile state and sanction the state like we do foreign governments?,"It's just a matter of definition and basic Constitutional law.  Once we start throwing states out of the country in order to impose sanctions, in what sense do we have a country any more?  Isn't this a fast track to dissolving America?"
406,"What exactly ARE ""US Gun Laws""?","Here's a quick overview:

Federally, the NFA or national firearm act was passed in the 30's. It explicitly forbids the manufacturing or selling of automatic firearms without federal registration. If you want an automatic firearm (which are extremely expensive and rare) you have to submit a lot of paperwork to the atf, pay a fee, and wait for approval. 

The NFA also covers rifles with barrels under 16 inches, shotguns with a barrel under 18 inches, and silencers. These all have to have paperwork submitted to the atf before you can actually take one home. These are tracked federally, and cannot be taken across state lines without notifying the atf. 

Federally, everytime a firearm is sold (from a retailer or some form of business) they have to run a background check. If you've committed a felony, were recently in some sort of mental institution or were involuntary committed, were dishonorably discharged from the military, or some other specific reason, you are forbidden from owning a firearm.  This background check system is referred to as the NICS, and is maintained by the FBI. 

On the state level, some states have more requirements for firearm ownership, others have the federal minimum and that's it. It varies wildly by state. Some states, like Illinois, require each and every firearm owner to have a license, which is processed and approved (or denied) by the state policy. Others, like Texas, have no restrictions. 

What's often talked about is the lack of state and federal laws regarding person to person sales (aka the loophole, except it isn't). Some states, like Illinois, require the sale to be logged with the state, and a file to kept for 10 years. Others, like a big chunk of the south and southwest, have no requirement, making it legally like selling a lawnmower or some other item. 

State laws vary wildy, and this is a very general overview."
407,Are there any bills that failed to pass due to low voter turnout?,"Voters don't vote for legislation. Legislators do.

The closest could be a ballot measure? But elections can't ""lose"" due to low voter turnout. There always a winner. Even if only a single voter showed up, whichever way that voter votes would win."
408,How to get a political job as a non-partisan,"A few thoughts on this.

First off, are you still a student?  If so, I'd recommend finding a polisci professor and talking with her about this.

That said, it sounds like you don't have a *degree* in economics, statistics, political science, etc.  Correct?  I don't know if this is a deal-breaker for certain organizations or not.

On to partisan politics: they're right.  You have to pick a party.  You mentioned Rove and Axelrod; their pinnacle achievements were winning presidential campaigns, but you don't get to run presidential  campaigns unless you have a demonstrated lifelong commitment to one party or the other.  Like it or not, a lot of party insiders are really true believers, and they just won't trust a ""I don't really identify with either side"" type.  It's ultimately a team sport, and you have to pick a team, and there are always going to be people who really do want to be there who will look better than you . . .

. . . unless you want to go pure data science/analysis/polling.  There are respected non-partisan polling institutes, and analysis type news publications (think FiveThirtyEight).  I know less about them, but your potential lack of a specific degree might hurt---but again, if you're a student, try interning.  They might just post job openings for their organizations, for all I know.

413,Is the aid to Ukraine like a loan that we will get back or just money we are giving away?,"It’s usually a gift, not a loan. The other comments here elaborate on how those gifts benefit the US too, but to directly answer your question, yes it’s typically a gift."
414,How do I Propose a Bill to become Federal Law?,"1) Be elected to congress

2). Right the bill and publicize it any way you can. Get enough people to support it and write, text, e-mail, call, etc a member of congress to convince them to propose it."
415,What would happen if the US Senate were to tie in a contingent election for Vice President?,"So this would come from the 12th amendment, relevant section quoted below:

>The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice.

So reading says, with 2/3 of the number of senators (so 67 of 100 senators if all senators are available), each senator get a vote and whoever gets a majority of the votes wins. Votes may only be cast for the two candidates with the highest electoral votes.

If the Senate is deadlocked in a tie, a plain reading of the text (specifically the text ""... two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary"") implies that only the Senators may vote on the Vice President, and the sitting VP is not able to cast a vote. The Senate could continue to debate and continue casting votes as they see fit. Any failure to nominate a VP would result in the office becoming vacant after inauguration.

Now obviously this is untested, and we've never had this situation come about in recent history, nor have we have any significant cases related to the 12th amendment on this issue. So it's possible the courts could rule the sitting VP does get a vote, but reading the amendment seems to imply only Senators get to vote."
416,Why is China called a communist state when it behaves like a capitalist/fascist state?,"Wait 'til you hear about the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea. 

Hint- two words in the name are accurate, and one of those is ""of""."
417,What is the true purpose of economic sanctions?,"Well, first off, you asked two separate questions:
What is the purpose of sanctions?
And are sanctions effective?
It seems you grasp well the purpose of them, they are a way to attempt to dissuade a country from doing things that don’t align with your interests, in a way that doesn’t threaten armed conflict. Now, as to wether they are effective, that’s much harder to say. See, you can’t prove a negative. You can’t say that without sanctions things would be the same as they are with sanctions, because we have no way of knowing. I happen to agree, however, that sanctions by themselves are not an effective strategy. Not only do they harm both countries equally, they also tend to harm the citizens of the countries way more than the rulers. Not to mention, it’s not like these countries we impose sanctions on just stop producing their goods. They can’t trade them with us, which hurts in the short term, but leads to them trading with other people, especially countries that are antagonistic towards those imposing the sanctions. This is what happened with Russia and Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis. The problem is, we currently don’t have a better way of punishing counties."
418,Why are both sides blaming the baby formula shortage on the government and not on the manufacturer?,"The baby formula issue is manufactured outrage. It isn’t actually meant to address the crux of the problem, which isn’t really the government’s fault. Technically without the NAFTA renegotiation we could just import more baby formula but that would require criticizing the Trump administration, so it’s not surprising the Republican tactic is to divert and distract by scapegoating immigrants and refugees instead."
419,Is there a coherent political ideology (besides Anarchy) that completely excludes police? Can an effective government exist without law enforcement?,"Police and Prison abolition is a well-articulated ideology held mostly by left-wing libertarians (including but not exclusively anarchists). I am not an expert but in general, from what I have read ""abolishing the police"" means replacing the police with some form of community protection system which would differ from the police in a few main ways

1. Be constituted by and fully and directly accountable to the people of the community. Mean people who participated in community protection would always be members of the community and their actions always be directly reported to the whole community and freely scrutinized. Force only ever be used as a last resort.
2. The purview of the community protection force (at least the part of it that might use force) is purely limited to violent incidents. Drug Use and Sex Work are completely decriminalized, and any law that targets marginalized people like sit-lie laws are taken off the books
3. This can only be fully achieved in the context of a broad transformation of the society away from one that values retributive over restorative justice.

420,Does the Russian invasion of Ukraine hurt the nuclear disarmament movement?,Ukraine had nuclear devices but no means to launch them. Ukraine didn’t actually have a nuclear weapons program so the nukes on its territory were more a liability than anything.
421,"From a historical perspective, how does the hyper-polarisation of politics usually end?","> it seems as though the Right and Left have never been further apart

It might seem that way, but I’m not sure it’s true. In the 1960s and 1970s, people were beating each other in the streets over politics. 

In the 1860s, we picked sides and started a war with one another."
422,Why don’t you see many people from Iowa running for President?,"Because it isn't that big of an advantage for them.  Them winning Iowa will be treated as a given and the other states will become battlegrounds.  This is what happened in 1992, when Tom Harkin ran for President and won Iowa easily but pretty much lost nearly all the other major battleground states.

And of course, Iowa has had a pretty terrible track record in the GOP primary when it comes to picking winners."
423,What would be the political implications of firing missiles at drug cartel bases in Mexico?,"There are no hard rules as to what constitutes an act of war. Would it be possible for the Mexican government to agree to let the US military attack the cartels? Yes. In secret? Launching missles internationally in secret? Nope. Not going to happen. Very hard to hide. Also very hard to fabricate.

The biggest legal problem that this plan has is that it's questionable in the human rights department. Countries are not supposed to use the military to enforce the law, and especially not kill people for breaking the law. That's the job of civilian law enforcement and the courts."
424,Did Bush SR. and G.W. Bush idea of national service extend to the military and culture?,"Both were actually at the same time neo-liberals and also neo-conservatives.  W. is a better distinction then his dad because George the first was more of a moderate Republican (which is why he lost and his own party hates him for it).  Neoliberalism is basically the economic philosophy of Margret Thatcher/what Ronald Regan was told.  So crush the unions, low taxes on the wealthy, kill the civil service and replace them with wage slaves so my friends can get rich; type of capitalism that was popular for a long time and is still the norm among the Mitt Romney type Republicans.  Neoconservatism is a foreign policy philosophy on the other hand.  It's basically that the USA should use military force to ""pacify"" some nations for ""freedom"".  We see this in the war on terror and Gulf war 2, and the great successes that both of those were.  I've always felt that when they talked about service they were really just talking about needing more cannon fodder."
425,How can people be anti-capitalist yet for social democracy?,"It's more that they prefer ""managed capitalism"" as opposed to actually destroying all capitalism.  This can also be focused on specific industries.  The idea of people making profit on providing health care is considered morally wrong to many Canadians for example.  But if you want to run a restaurant, and follow the laws that's fine.  So too bad US style health insurance companies.  But good luck on your pizza joint!"
426,"Does the Supreme Court (US) really overturn established precedent (roe v wade) on their own, as seems to be the case with this SC leak? Don't they usually just rule on cases brought to them?","This leak was the opinion written for an actual case, out of Mississippi.  The question before the court was whether Mississippi's law was valid given Roe and Casey. So they were answering the question posed by the parties to the dispute.  Procedurally it was pretty ordinary."
427,Videos have been released showing Putin looking unwell. Why would the Russian government be OK with releasing videos that make Putin look weak?,">These make Putin look unwell and frail. Doesn't the Russian government realise this? If they do, why release them without doctoring them to not make Putin look so weak?  


Russian media is highly controlled by the government but isn't all directly administered by it. These aren't all from packaged edits from the Kremlin but from events put on by the Kremlin for media to gather their shots and repackage themselves. Not to say this is some subversive effort by that media (because it is again highly controlled) but the content is less gatekept.

A 'positive' interpretation is that any leader under almost constant spotlight will have unflattering footage of them, especially for a job that takes a lot out of you. Look at any US President in the modern media age - when you're under the camera lens basically non-stop, it's only human to catch a moment where you don't look well or speak incorrectly. The more negative interpretation is that this *is* the good content and that yes, he is actually very unwell and in an effort to bolster his image, they arranged these events to show his strength and this is the best they could do right now - better than letting people imagine him truly on his death bed or immobile. 

>Should I assume that these videos are deepfake propaganda videos from Ukraine or western nations?  


No."
428,If Roe is overturned would it be possible to criminalize abortion even to save the life of the mother?,"There are many states that have passed laws that would trigger if Roe is overturned that criminalize everthing to do with abortion. In Louisiana simply giving someone plan B makes you an accomplice to murder. By Louisiana's new definition even aborting an ectopic pregnancy is murder. A woman in texas was even recently arrested for a miscarriage. 

Total criminalization is coming to at least some states."
429,How do diplomats negotiate concessions with countries they don't trust without insulting them?,"Diplomats don't negotiate with other countries, because countries aren't things you can negotiate with, any more than corporations are people (Citizens United notwithstanding) They negotiate with people who represent other countries, which seems like a pedantic distinction but it's the main point here. Diplomats strive to create good working relationships with their counterparts precisely so they can have meaningful negotiations regardless of what the latest political rhetoric might be. If you insult the individual, yes, that breaks down the relationship, but diplomats don't usually insult their counterparts. The equivalent of my country insulting yours is more similar to you being a die-hard Tigers fan and you hearing my dad insulting all things Detroit. It probably won't help our rapport but our relationship isn't gonna break down because of it.

Think of it like this: you and I are best friends but we only hang out at school because our parents hate each other. You and I can trust each other because we're in class, play on the same teams, etc. Etc. We know that our families aren't likely to budge on anything, so when we I need to use your dad's camera for a school project, we know we need to get your uncle (a neutral third party) to supervise. We can get past all the awful things our parents say about each other (and us) because of our individual relationships.

Now think of the same scenario but we don't share any classes, friends or hobbies. Doing anything productive is a lot harder as you probably won't give me the time of day, which is why diplomats spend so much time on relationship building, and why not having normalized relationships with the globe community is so difficult. 

We struggle to make progress with North Korea, Iran, etc. because we haven't built up the trust needed to make progress regardless of the situation. But even then, there are a few key people on both sides who know each other well enough to trust that when the US says they'll give food aid in exchange for prisoners, and they'll do it in a way that is hard for either side to back out, they'll work with us to get it done. You're just a lot less likely to work on time horizons or exchanges that aren't tit-for-tat if the diplomatic relationships aren't anything more than a cursory aquaintace."
430,"Assuming that Roe is in fact, overturned when the final decision is rendered, will its historical significance parallel that of the Dred Scott decision?","Not in the same way.  First of, as furious as I am about the decision, chattel slavery is way worse then banning abortion.  Also, so far, they haven't let red states enforce abortion bans outside of state lines, though the Texas abortion bounty law is also terrifying.  

But what's novel about this decision that, outside of criminal law, the courts haven't really eliminated rights.  They limit them all the time, but eliminating a right is new.  Even in criminal cases, they limit rights more than eliminating them.  

How this will play out remains to be seen, but the ""cold civil war"" thing is more relevant then ever with the 14th Amendment as a whole in jeopardy."
431,What would be the ramifications if Republicans had a more urbanist agenda that catered to cities (investing in transit and affordable housing)?,"People don't vote on policies, they vote on rhetoric, and policies are, (in addition to being policies)  in a sense, a form of rhetoric. 

Everybody (in theory) wants ""cities to be more liveable"" right? Any Republican running in a city is going to run on a platform of making their city more liveable. But they are going to focus on different things. A republican will focus on crime, government bureaucracy, and lower taxes. Do people who live in cities not care about those things? Of course, they do, in fact, Democrats have run on those issues and won (see the current Mayors of New York and San Francisco)

But when Republicans run on those issues their rhetoric is, more often than not, heard as part of the border's decades-long strategy to use those issues as dog-whistles, for white suburbanites. The Republican Party has made itself the party of racial grievance, where crime is about pathologizing, blackness,  complaints about bureaucracy is about ""welfare queens"" and lower taxes almost never benefit the lower class. That has screwed urban Republicans running in liberal and diverse cities. Whether they intend those policies to be dog whistles or not, so long as they have an R next to their name that's how they will be heard."
432,What Will Happen If Roe v Wade Is Overturned ?,"Overturning Roe v. Wade simply means that the Supreme Court is rejecting the notion that there is a constitutional right to abortion. This means that states will have the freedom to legislate their own abortion laws. In all likelihood, blue states will provide rigorous protections for the right to an abortion (as many already have under Roe) while red states will quickly regulate them, many even banning it outright or restricting access so much that it is effectively banned (e.g. Texas's ""heartbeat bill"" allows abortions only up until 6 weeks after conception when a fetal heartbeat can physically be detected, which is before most women even know they are pregnant). It is possible to pass abortion protections at the federal level, but this is unlikely given both the 50-50 split in the Senate as well as the existence of the filibuster.

I should add that, regardless of one's opinion on the morality of abortion, studies show that this will lead to more illegal abortions and/or women simply traveling from red states into blue states in order to receive one. This would cause both a disproportionate impact on poorer women and potentially overwhelm the clinics still operating in blue states."
433,How does HB813 ban IUD/contraceptives?,"HB813 defines abortion as anything after the moment of fertilization (text here: [https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1276214](https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1276214))   
How pregnancy works is, broadly, egg accepts sperm and starts dividing \[this is fertilization or conception\]. Not every zygote survives this process. If it does, some 5-18 days after fertilization the zygote tries to travel to the uterus and implant. Again, not every zygote is successful. Because somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of fertilized eggs never make it to implantation, and because the body doesn't even recognize there's a fertilized egg until it's implanted (you cannot even test positive for pregnancy until implantation), implantation is considered the start of pregnancy by the medical community. And an IUD works by making it difficult for a sperm to reach an egg, and a fertilized egg to implant. So if you're going by HB813's definition, IUDs are aborting unborn children."
434,Are Legislative Districts Constitutionally Required,"For the US house it's been required to be single member districts since the 60's to prevent the white majority taking all of the seats.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-member_district

>On Dec 14, 1967, single-member House districts were mandated by law (2 U.S. Code §2c), under the justification that they served as bulwarks against southern Democrats diluting the electoral power of African Americans by using strategically drawn at-large multi-member districts (they could, for instance, create a single statewide multi-member district elected by plurality vote, all but guaranteeing the white majority would elect all Democrats[4]).[3]

The 17th amendment does the same for the US Senate

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution

States are free to organize the state legislature however they want though."
435,What would happen if a US state tried to stop the enforcement of a federal abortion law?,[deleted]
436,"Theoretically, could one senator block all legislation by filibustering?","Answer: A filibuster can be overridden by a vote of 60.  

Presumably that third part candidate would just get voted down every time."
437,"Since Justice Jackson is already confirmed, what's to stop her being placed into SCOTUS immediately and tying the vote to overturn Roe v Wade?",[removed]
438,Why was Former Ukraine President Victor Yushchenko poisoned?,"Yuschenko was poisoned during his campaign for the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. His main rival for the presidency was Viktor Yanukovych, the notoriously corrupt incumbent from the pro-Russian Party of Regions. Russia was undoubtedly trying to sabotage the election. 

In fact, Yanukovych at first appeared to have won re-election, but Ukraine’s Supreme Court found a massive amount of interference and fraud and ordered a second round of voting with safeguards in place, resulting in Yushchenko’s victory. Yuschenko’s poisoning was only the most egregious part of this wider campaign of election interference."
439,"Before Roe v Wade is overturned, what is stopping the current Democrat-controlled Congress from passing a law to enshrine abortion rights?","Two parts to it:

* Filibuster: practically speaking, they'd actually need to get 60 votes in support to get past the filibuster. Functionally (and a bit circuitiously) they could vote to get rid of the filibuster with a simple majority - but that would require literally every Democrat on board - and both Manchin and Sinema have said repeatedly that they will not vote to get rid of the filibuster.
* But even if they did, they would need all 50 votes to actually pass it, which again, Manchin has already gone on record saying he wouldn't do - and to be honest, it would likely put many Democratic Senators even in a tough spot. That being said, it would also put some Republicans in a tough spot from states where support for Roe v Wade is relatively high (e.g. Collins).

And what's stopped it from happening before, well similar dynamics to the above and some convenient side stepping of the issue. Congress doesn't actually work on simple majorities (or rather the Senate specifically doesn't) as it stands now. So as much as people claim trifectas, having a majority in the Senate actually doesn't allow you to do much on your own (it does however allow you to prevent a lot, which is still hugely important). And a lot of Reps and Senators would have preferred this to be a non-issue. As much as the GOP nationally makes a big fuss of it, and Dems nationally make a fuss of defending it, there are a fair number of vulnerable members on both sides who have constituencies that would react strongly to action from either of them. The beauty of Roe v Wade being 'settled law' from the Courts and outside of their jurisdiction was that they didn't need to push the issue - it was 'settled law'. Much like how you still even see many GOP Reps and Senators who don't want to support same sex marriage but also don't have to oppose it because it's 'settled'."
440,Is it worth it to codify abortion rights?,"Yes and no.  The recent opinion attacks the Constitutional basis for a right to abortion.  A federal law provides an independent basis for such a right, unless the opponents of the law can show that the way it's written would run afoul of some other Constitutional principle.  Which is not likely to be the case here.

The bigger problem is that Congress can always pass a law invalidating an earlier law.  Depending on who has the majority, an abortion law might last for decades, or months.  It would be an incredible political football with no real stability, which is the main benefit of Roe and Casey (such as they were.)"
441,Could Biden simply ignore the Supreme Court like Andrew Jackson did?,"He can say whatever he wants about abortion.  The issue is that in the absence of Roe, each state is going to decide their own policy.  The federal government is on the sidelines in this fight."
442,"Sociologically speaking, what caused The Great 'AwOkening', i. e. the phenomenon whereby Democrats suddenly moved very far to the left on social policy from c. 2012 onwards?","Your question seems to be implying that the current social positions of the Democratic Party (transgender rights, gay marriage, pro-choice, etc) are far-left, radical even. Your use of the word ""woke"" suggests that you are right-wing (progressives stopped using ""woke"" years ago).

Democrats moved somewhat to the left gradually because of three factors:

Society's growing acceptance of people that didn't conform to traditional expectations of identity,

Political polarization over the last 6 decades,

And a slew of very public racially-charged shootings (usually by police) that sparked embers with the dearh of Treyvon Martin in 2011, caught fire with the death of Michael Brown in 2014 and made the flames bigger with the death of George Floyd in 2020.

I have questions for you; are socially liberal positions  bad or something? Does ""woke"" mean anything anymore?"
443,When can an election be seen as trustworthy?,"There are some objective markers of ""free and fair"" elections and they tend to be pretty obvious things like can an opposition candidate run, who does the vote counting and how, is turnout weirdly high and one-sided, etc.

There are other measures that different evaluation systems will use that are more specific to those organizations.

On a broad level, the vast majority of what makes elections trustworthy is do people genuinely trust them to deliver a fair result (note, not the result they *want*.) If they do, that tends to be the biggest indicator.

There are always going to be people who think any election that doesn't go the way they want it to wasn't fair and if they can produce actual, credible evidence of chicanery that goes beyond simple incompetence or localized mischief making then there's a discussion to be had. If all they can do is point to smoke and mirrors as evidence, they're probably not worth being given attention.

Australia, as far as I'm aware, doesn't *have* to let the UN in to monitor their elections though requesting UN monitoring may be a way to shore up confidence in an election (unless the goal is to cast doubt over the election regardless of what happens) or to defray concerns about there being problems."
444,"Is there an ideology where the economy is heavily unionized (i.e., workers have a large amount of protection and benefits, very good pay, representatives on the board), but corporate taxation is low?","Yes, it's the [Nordic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model)"

446,Why is the president of Ukraine asking for a no-fly zone if he knows NATO can't give it to him?,"Prime negotiating tactic, start at the extreme - what you know you will NOT get -  and then move incrementally towards getting the best deal you actually know you CAN get, and if you get more than that, it's a double win. He has 100% of the moral high ground here, so the West knows it has to put up some really good equipment and other aid as consolation. Smart move on his part, because continually and publicly asking for the no-fly zone will keep internal pressure from the citizens of other countries on their own governments to give more aid."
447,Why didn't Anita Hill's allegations cost Clarence Thomas an appointment to the SCOTUS?,"Which nominees that were rejected are you thinking of?  And which party were they?

I mean, Kavanaugh was 'approved' despite being manifestly unfit for office and having credible allegations against him.

448,Why did Biden lost Florida?,"Florida has more Cuban immigrants/refugees then it did before, which tend to be more conservative and capitalist as they’ve escaped from a left wing dictatorship.  Also, Biden just isn’t as popular or charismatic as Obama is.  

That’s the short answer anyways"
449,Am I understanding the Entrenchment Clause in the US Constitution denying equal suffrage in the Senate correctly?,"So that is a correct plain reading, but as with most untested and unlitigated Constitutional questions, whether it would work would come down to how such an amendment was implemented and the political/social landscape at the time and the SCOTUS makeup at the time."
450,Why is only 1/5th (as far as I can tell) of Russia's army in Ukraine at the moment? Why doesn't Russia send more given that things aren't going that well there for them?,"Because not 100% of an army are combat personnel. For every combat unit, you will need support units who might be trained for combat but won't be sent to fight directly.

The troops left behind are either support personel for their bases or specifically left behind for other purposes (reserve forces, defensive positions, etc).

Edit: I tried looking about numbers but 20% (best guess on my part) of the US Army are ""combat arms"" as an example."
451,Has the trade war between China and USA ended?,"No, it's ongoing. Tail end of Trump administration negotiated a purchasing agreement with China (basically, buy american soybeans and we'll take off the tariffs) that [China then resolutely ignored](https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-phase-one-tracker-chinas-purchases-us-goods), largely because enforcement was a joke. The tariffs have plateaued under the new administration but aren't gone. See here; https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart"
452,Why is Western Neoliberalism portrayed as being anti-cultural relativism when it is extremely pro-relativism?,"There’s no singular monolithic ideology to the economic process of neoliberalism. It’s obvious to anybody who’s not inside a partisan bubble that there is an ideological ecosystem with multiple poles. These also correspond with multiple sections of the capital class and sincere differences of opinion within that class. 

The part of capital which relies on the import of raw materials will have a strong incentive to promote the underdevelopment of whereever they import from. On the other hand people who see underdeveloped places as potential markets for manufactured goods will want to promote modernization (and therefore westernization) so that products can be marketed there. The more westernized the more easily a place can be integrated into the capitalist world system. 

If you follow the actual communications on the governmental level, the west really isn’t nearly as shy as you think about criticizing non-western places. It’s exactly because of this that there’s a section within the media ideological ecosystem that is dedicated to criticizing such ‘cultural imperialism’. The bigger factor is that you as an American or Canadian just does not see that much reporting about places outside your own country. It’s just not that interesting to most people, and most news agencies do not put money into covering international affairs except when it directly implicates American national interests.  Even a lot of stories that are of American interest, like US military involvement across Africa are hardly covered at all for the pretty simple reason that Americans don’t care and it’s more expensive to cover. 

The basic process is that capitalism overall wants places to expand to new places, as this is easier the more like us they are. However they don’t need to be exactly like us, just willing to morph in certain ways. Overall systems of ‘universalism’ will be the most market compatible, so that stands as a sort of pole a market system moves towards, but the market system can still work under severe deformations to universalism so will resist pushing a non market society if it risks triggering an anti-market reaction. 

I’d strongly recommend you check out the book Introduction to World Systems Analysis by Emmanuel Wallerstein. That is a book all about the relationship between the Core (west) and Periphery (Non-western) nations within the Capitalist World-System, and gets into things like the ideological ecosystem of the west as containing the three polls of conservative, liberal, and radical left in an ever evolving web, as well as the role of ‘special interest groups’ (as he calls them) in both core and periphery. 

I don’t think I’ve done a great job summarizing his points, but I feel like that book and world-systems thinking in general would really help you see the points you are making from a much wider scope. You are getting at a bunch of things that are all true phenomena buts it’s just not all fitting together and that’s frustrating, something like world-systems zooms out far enough to see that your own vantage point was creating blind spots."
453,Can a President Purposefully Have an Executive Order Challenged in a Federal Court?,"The executive branch has no authority over the judicial branch. The president can't control which judge will take his case. Or at least, that's the idea. It would take either some real Deep State kinda nonsense for that to happen, or our judicial system would no longer be independent and our democracy would more or less be dead.

The only way this could be a real strategic choice is if the president brought the suit in a circuit court that was known to be a bit more friendly to the president's perspective, but even then that circuit court could still be overruled by the SCOTUS. If there truly was something like this going on, where a VERY suspect ruling went down at the circuit level, the SCOTUS would very likely take the case just to clear up any concerns about judicial impartiality."

458,Is NATO partially at fault for the Ukraine-Russian war?,"The War Crime of Aggression, of invading another country and wantonly killing civilians, is always entirely the fault of the aggressor. If I murder somebody, arguing I had to do it because they might have entered into a defensive pact with their neighbors is ridiculous.

Maybe there were things the West could have done better, sure. Russian public opinion towards the West did sour when NATO began to be expanded — but back in 2001 Russia was absolutely willing to partner with NATO in the aftermath of 9-11 and treat NATO as an ally, not a threat.

Putin just grew worse and worse, more paranoid, more cruel, more draconian, the longer he was in power. Power does that to some people. The West gave him many chances to fix the relationship. In retrospect, I don’t think we could have prevented Putin becoming what he has become.

If we want to look at something the West could have done better, I’d look at the Yeltsin years and our involvement in the Loans-for-Shares program, where Russian state assets were rapidly sold off in a program of then fashionable economic “shock therapy.” Gangsters bought up the bulk of Russian capital and the oligarch class was born, creating the ecosystem that enabled Putin’s rise to power.

Instead of shock therapy we should have done something like a Marshall plan for Russia."
459,What would Burkean conservative policies look like?,"I's say he might fit better as either the all-but-gone far left side of the Republican party or the rightward side of the Democratic one. 

Basically, he seems to have a belief in liberty, rights, and a well-run free country while also thinking that the masses are too stupid and childish to make this happen for themselves and require an upper class to guide them to it. 

So, in the modern US, everybody would dislike him."
460,What is American and NATO (counter)propaganda?,"The thing about propaganda is that it doesn't have to be untruthful at all- the root word is the same as to propagate. 

If the truth about a situation is that bad for one side, all you have to do is make sure that side keeps hearing about it.

What should have been a quick, easy, cheap conquest is turning into a long, slow, expensive mess. That's all the US and NATO really need as psy ops fodder, and it's unquestionably true."
461,How much science-based decision making is done when passing anything?,"If you're asking about Congress passing legislation, the answer is very little science-based decision making happens for a lot of things.  Congress may commission studies and have subcommittees research into things, but at the end of the day, politicians gonna politic.

The good news is that for much environmental legislation (and many other laws implemented by administrative agencies) they pass the buck right along to the people in those agencies whose job it is to make the laws work.  The federal law passed by Congress will establish an agency and give it the power to make regulations over clean air or transportation or whatever.

462,What do more intellectually-minded conservatives think of current laws proposed and/or passed in Republican controlled states?,"This question is a bit impossible to answer unless you generalize. Even then, it is difficult as you need to define what an educated voter is. Are we considering college educated, only? What about trade schools? Advanced graduate degrees only?

Generally, even educated conservatives are still conservative—albeit, the group as a whole may have more refined views. For example, I oppose CRT as the junior high and lower level, but I’m fine with it being taught as one of many theories/schools of though along with other controversial schools of thought. I recall even being taught stuff like Feminist and Marxist schools of historical interpretation back in undergrad history class. 

On the other hand, my abortion view—by way of example—is probably even more conservative than the conservative voting populace as a whole."
463,What kinds of international policies could U.S Healthcare adapt to provide universal healthcare?,"I'm from the Netherlands, compared to the US I think these are the most important differences:

1. Access to basic healthcare is unconditional
2. Mandatory basic health insurance
3. What is covered by a basic insurance is defined by the government
4. Compensation for profesionals in healthcare is capped"
464,From a political scientists point of view — what scenarios are likely for the future of North Korea?,"The People's Democratic Republic of Korea (as the kids say) is a hereditary dictatorship - unlike some other regimes, transfers of power are orderly and have, as of yet, not been by coup. Successors are chosen and then lionized for the role in state media, preparing their legitimacy for when they take the throne. This stability is more common to absolute monarchies and other family regimes, where elites need not worry as much when the leader dies. Elites are more likely to remain in power supporting the family successor, and vise versa.

This being said, the DPRK does show signs of regime weakness. According to witnesses and footage smuggled out of the country, people have shown a increased willingness to be defiant about accusations from the police/military, so long as the offenses aren't political crimes. Foreign media continues to be snuggled into the ""hermit kingdom"" on DVDs and flash drives, and those who can afford it have quite the appetite for Western TV shows.

Perhaps the biggest threat North Korea faces is its dependence on its neighbors. Ironically for a state dedicated to Juche (self-reliance), the DPRK's economy is propped up by China. For now, China is willing to provide food and energy assistance to its totalitarian beneficiary because it fears sharing a border with a unified Korea (or should I say, a unified Korea under US influence). But should China's interests change, and the supplies stop flowing, the Kim Dynasty could unravel quickly. North Korea has almost always had food shortages, and the possibility of a second devastating famine lingers."
465,Has anyone heard anything about Putins health?,"Of course there are rumors. If you were at war with someone, you'd spread all kinds of rumors to destabilize their power base. I'm sure the west is responsible for some of these rumors and I'm sure some are true. We'll know in 10 years, or when he drops dead.

Best to not put too much stock in rumors."
466,Why use delegate system for Democratic primaries?,"Great question. The modern concept of a popular primary was invented only very recently--after the 1970 Kent State riot outside of DNC headquarters. Up to that point, the parties nominated candidates based on input almost entirely from party insiders. The nomination process was not transparent and voters had no direct input, and with LBJ not running and the DNC in a period of significant transition (they had only just recently purged the party of Southern conservatives and then their most popular leaders were either shot dead or stepping away, creating both a need for strong leadership and a power vacuum), Dem voters were fed up with this process, leading to the riots. This sentiment was vindicated when the ""backroom deals in smoke filled rooms"" selected party elite Hubert Humphrey, who then lost in a not-all-that-close election to a candidate JFK already beat just a few years ago. The fact that Nixon completely redesigned his political platform and may as well have been a different candidate was overlooked at the time.

So the Dems solved this problem with a reform measure to create primaries. McGovern and Fraser formed the McGovern-Fraser Commission and proposed the format for what would later become the very first primary structure. Under the McGovern-Fraser rules, party leaders were sidelined almost entirely. Each state ran a selection and whoever had the most support at the end of the selection period won the nomination.

Delegates are used because especially when the selection season is months long, it's a lot easier to use a proxy measurement that's in the scale of hundreds than in the scale of tens of millions. Think about it this way. There are 25 states done 25 left to go. One guy has a lead of 10 million votes. How much of a lead is that? Is it a lot? Can it be made up? Can you imagine, especially for voters, trying to figure out the state of the race and having to add up the eligible voter population among Dems in each of the remaining states? It would be completely inaccessible.

So instead, McGovern and Fraser proposed delegates. The delegates to each state are proportionally assigned--CA has the highest population of eligible voters, so it has the highest number of delegates. NH has less voters so it has less delegates. And so on. Now, ordinary voters can have investment in the process without having to do math that measures in millions.

The early results showed some promise. Voters seemed to be alright with the new system. McGovern left the commission in 1971 to run for president. He won...and then got absolutely destroyed in historic fashion. The next candidate selected by the process was Jimmy Carter. Carter fared better in the general election, but keep in mind that was the first election post-Watergate. William Jennings Bryan could have run and won. But once the Reps had a chance to move past the Watergate legacy, Carter fared much less well and lost in almost historic fashion against Reagan.

So as you can see, while the McGovern-Fraser rules were a step forward for the process, the early returns revealed that the process tended to reward highly ideological candidates that played well to the base but didn't compete well in a national election. McGovern and Carter both were utterly destroyed, and looking to the future, Mondale couldn't break the mold either. Something needed to be done.

Enter the Hunt Commission. The Hunt Commission convened in 1980 with the intent of fixing the process started with McGovern-Fraser and it created the process we used up until 2020. Hunt introduced one key change: superdelegates. The concept was that as important as voters are, voters have trouble thinking at the larger picture of effective campaign strategy, and that's where party leaders can help improve the process. Superdelegates were a way for party leaders to be able to weigh in directly for a portion of the process, hopefully electing someone much more effective nationally than the voter base was currently allowing.

Early returns for this process were much better. Sure, you still had Mondale win in 1984, but the process was still figuring out and he was clearly associated with the old Carter administration selected before Hunt. After Mondale, Dukakis was a much better candidate. He still wasn't particularly close, but his support was at least built across various constituencies in a way Carter and Mondale's wasn't. He showed the proof of concept by carrying states in the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Pacific Northwest, even if the Dems still had a lot of work to do.

Hunt further proved its effectiveness by continuing onward with Clinton, the first Dem president to win in a real, non-Watergate election since 1964. Clinton was the true nationally effective candidate that McGovern-Fraser couldn't seem to find, and he was followed by more of the same. Al Gore actually won the popular vote. Kerry lost, but it wasn't a tremendous blowout, and it was against a popular incumbent after 9/1\`1, so hard to get too bent out of shape there. He was followed by Obama, who was obviously an excellent candidate, then Clinton, who like Gore only barely lost, and then Biden, who actually won.

Before the 2020 election, one more reform was made. Starting in the Obama nomination years, voters started to get very concerned about superdelegates overturning the will of the voters. Of course, this has never happened, and since the introduction of superdelegates the candidates have been objectively far superior. Nonetheless, voters grew concerned that in a highly divisive field, superdelegates had a bad influence on the process, particularly as Sanders and Clinton had a very divisive battle in 2016. And so before 2020, superdelegates were reformed to automatically confirming the results of the regular delegates except in cases of a contested convention where no one reaches a majority.

EDIT: Quick correction. Kent State was in 1970 and was an anti-war protest, not a riot demanding increased representative democracy. The event I was thinking of was the 1968 DNC nomination riots. Thanks to u/cincyblog for correcting me."

You're missing the distinction between (c)(3) and (c)(4) organizations.  Donations to a (c)(3) are tax deductible but can't be used for campaign stuff.  A (c)(4) can do campaign stuff, but donations aren't tax deductible.

469,Does China actually own a majority of US debt? (Question expanded in post),"Most is owed to ourselves (US citizens) through mutual funds and Social Security administration purchases. Just googled this article that appears to have decent information on the topic.

As far as foreign governments holding our debt, China is the second largest behind Japan. Typically this is in the form of US treasury bonds, and maybe someone else can chime it that knows more about it, but I know they have different maturity dates and I'm not sure they can recall the money prior to their maturity date or not. The time frames are anywhere from 4 weeks to 30 years on treasury bonds, and I imagine governments would be parking their assets in longer term bonds than the shorter term ones."
470,"Broadly speaking, what are the Reddit community's biggest misconceptions about how US politics operates?","Probably that the President has all the power to improve the economy.  Realistically no President should ever run for re-election by saying they fixed the economy in their first term, since their general economic impact isn't really felt until after the mid term period of their second term.  For example Trump's good economy in his first two years was really just the wake of Obama.  This was the same story with W. Bush and Clinton."
471,Why isn't supplying arms to foreign countries deemed an act of war by their enemies?,"Sometimes it is deemed an act of war, or at least an act of hostility.  Sometimes nations respond by attacking the shipping that's transferring the weapons (even sinking ships on the open seas at times).  

Generally speaking, it makes sense to distinguish between a direct attack, and an indirect attack.  Supplying weapons is an indirect attack.  During the Cold War, the US and the Soviets both had an extensive history of supplying weapons to groups the other side was fighting; while never having their own troops engage in direct conflicts with the other side.  Proxy wars, as they are called, were quite common.  Most likely Russia isn't complaining because they simply view it as another proxy war; and also because they don't want other nations to intervene more directly.  Russia knows it can't afford to pick a fight with more nations, so they choose not to take any directly offensive action to counter the flow of arms into Ukraine."
472,Which European countries are traditionally known to be left wing?,"Sweden is probably the closest fit if we measure purely electorally. Sweden has been governed by a center-left party for 14 out of the last 22 years.

Greece and Iceland are not usually considered ""left-wing countries"" but it is worth noting that they have elected the two most ""left-wing"" Prime Ministers (Alex Tsipars in Greece, Katrín Jakobsdóttir in Iceland) in recent memory, all though both had to form a coalition with right-wing parties."
473,What negative effects of our current criminal justice system are often overlooked in the conversation about criminal justice reform?,"I don't know exactly what to call it, but basically the negative feedback loop of people in the system, but outside of it. I'll explain:

First, we have to look at the two key pressures which create this problem. The first player is the special interest groups: The people who offer counselling, drug testing, monitoring, rehab, etc... All these industries benefit for stronger and more ""treatment"" and monitoring. Second, the politicians. They look at adding more ""programs"" or different types of punishment for failure, as helping the individual. 

Let me give you two scenarios I saw CONSTANTLY with people right on the edges of the system and how it completely destroyed their lives because they lacked the means. 

1) Normal guy, living a normal lower middle class life, paycheck to paycheck, like many Americans. One day he does something stupid and gets a bunch of traffic tickets, one of which was reckless driving which gives the officer the option to tow your car. He doesn't have to, but if he's feeling extra grumpy that day he can.

Well tows are REALLY expensive to get your car out, and every day the cost just compounds. So he's unable to get his car out, at the same time, he loses his job because you know, he can't get to work. So he loses what little he had, but his mother has a crappy old RV junker (which is more than most people could be offered), and takes that and lives in that. (She lives in a retirement home)

This is just enough to scrape by and get another job while he lives in an RV (Again, most poor people don't even have this opportunity. He's more privileged than most people in the trap)

One day he gets cops randomly doing a ""wellness check"" on the guy since living in your RV is illegal in the city. So they arrest him, only to find out he hasn't paid those tickets that originally got him in this mess, so they send him to jail where you spend 1 day per 100 dollars, so he's locked for 2 weeks. Of course, he loses his job again, and when he returns, his RV has been towed and not only can he not afford to get it out, but he never even finds out who the hell towed it. 

So when he's released from jail, he's quite literally homeless, and that's how he began his life on the streets. 

2) Scenario two: In my state if you get a DUI you have to go through a really tough program or go to jail for 6 months. Most people avoid both, because they get attorneys who get the charges reduced, but if you're poor that's obviously out of the question. However, if you get a second DUI (In this state as little as a single beer is enough for a DUI), you aren't getting those charges reduced again regardless... So you have to decide, 6 months in jail, or the super expensive program?

Most rational people will do anything to avoid jail, so they enter the program. Well, the program is just a financial drain beyond belief. First off, you have to spend thousands of dollars doing ""classes"" - all of which can be done online, are super easy, pointless, and just cost money to speed through a crappy slideshow to get to the easy quiz at the end to pass.

Once you pass that, now you have 4 ""counselling"" sessions per week: 2 group, 2 one on one. Those aren't cheap if you don't have good insurance. They'll reduce the cost for uninsured poor people, but still, that's close to 250 a week alone in counselling costs. 

But you also have 3 random drug tests a week. So that's another 150 dollars a week   

You also have to ""report to the court"" once a week which can take all day, meaning you can't work that day

You also have to have an ankle monitor on because you're technically on house arrest, so that's another 150 a month  

But the best part, is you MUST live alone (rationale is another person can cause you to slip up), so you can't even have roommates, thus have to pay for your own place  

But it's not over, the breathalyzer for the car, another 100 a month, insurance premiums which go up, plus another second DUI insurance, which is another 100 a month. 

Now this is where this ""program designed to keep people out of prison and help them"" becomes a nightmare. We are at about roughly 1900 dollars a month just in FEES to not be in jail for all these stupid programs, and that's before we even consider being forced to have your own place.

But the whole time you obviously need a job to pay this incredible burden you have to live under... But how the hell do you work a job when you have 3 random drug tests, 4 counsellings, and 1 whole day of waiting in court? You can work a 9-5, but it's REALLY hard. And if you accidentally drink too much water one day right before your random drug test, they'll interpret that diluted water pee as you trying to mask your urine, making it an instant fail, and you go straight to rehab for 30 days during your next weekly court -- which means: You lost your job, and now have an eviction on your record because you can't afford to pay your rent. Car break down on the way to one of your 4 counselling sessions? Also considered a failure, but instead you're thrown in jail. 

At this point, most people realize it would have just been easier to go to jail for 6 months and wait it out than deal with that stress. Failure is so common, and the courts just look at everyone as criminals and scoundrels so they don't care a bit.

``````````````````

So yeah, those are just two examples that I've seen which are super super super common. So many people in jails in my state, just got trapped in this negative feedback loop caused by an overbearing system that just creates so much opportunity for failure"

477,Was it an objectively bad foreign policy decision for the US to have so extensively funded & trained the Mujahideen?,"The USA didn't train the Mujahideen.  People really overestimate how involved USA was in Afghansitan when in reality we had no ground presence there until the 2001 invasion.  All training was done by Pakistan who was also the party responsible for actually arming the rebel groups.  The USA's main role was more of a fundraiser and as a weapons smuggler and was generally hands off otherwise.  I wouldn't be surprised if the USA talked to China about Afghanistan more than they talked to actual on-ground Afghanistan fighters.

Also, I don't know if you are aware of this but some of the language in the text sorta hints you might not understand the relationship between the Mujahideen and the Taliban but to make it clear:  **Mujahideen =/= Taliban**.  The Taliban actually rose in opposition to the Mujahideen lead government in the 1990s and many Mujahideen leaders either fled the country or would form the domestic anti-Taliban groups in Afghanistan.  Many of the early Taliban fighters weren't even in Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets, but were actually in Pakistan.

I don't think the policy of funding/arming the resistance was a bad idea and it clearly worked.  The actual issue was our relations with Pakistan and pretty much giving them free reign to use the funding and weapons as they see fit.  It was Pakistan that decided to funnel most of the funds into Hekmatyar, who was known as one of the nastiest guys in a group of nasty guys, for their own interests.  It was Pakistan that decided to abandon him and decide to throw their weight behind the Taliban, who they armed and trained as Afghanistan broke out in Civil War.  And its Pakistan that essentially gave Taliban and other groups a safe harbor to lick their wounds.  The other controversial issue is our willingness and support of Saudi Arabia, whose education funding ended up being the basis for much of the Taliban ideology.

>invading in 2001 and toppling them surely only served to antagonise them & other terrorist groups further

It didn't actually.  The 2001 was devastating for them and they spent years calling for peace negotiations because they got destroyed so badly.  The big mess up in hindsight was that we should have taken up that offer, which many of our Afghan allies called for, and let a de-armed Taliban rejoin the Afghanistan government.  We didn't and years of Afghanistan government corruption and protection from Pakistan allowed the Taliban eventually to come back."
478,What are the premises of gun control as a platform?,"\> In a utopia where we can trust the police, maybe so. But I am of the libertarian left. (Not to be confused with the capitalist libertarian right.) If I know it's possible I might be targeted by violent crime at any moment, and my adversary might have a gun, and I believe I cannot rely on the police, then isn't carrying my own gun my only option?

It's stuff like this that makes the political compass useless. It's isn't ""authoritarian"" to expect that the police force...you know, works. It isn't virtuous and ""libertarian"" to believe that you should oppose basic social services because they sometimes have a miniscule failure rate. Literally we live in a society and the whole purpose of society is that we *don't* have to take the law into our own hands. That's like the foundational concept behind government. If you can't operate on that as a somewhat basic premise for the whole thing, then you're not engaging with the political system at all, quadrant be damned.

I mean, there's just so much to break down about ""carrying my won gun be my only option."" Do you really think the right way to resolve any and all potential crime threats you may face, no matter what they are, is to pull out a gun? Do you really think that pulling out a gun will always be a sufficient condition to prevent said crime? If he has a gun, and you have a gun, does he just go ""oh, touche, guess I'll go find someone else?"" This is such facile logic. It's incredibly ideological, and only works when you completely ignore the fact that more guns almost always equals more crime and more violence. That's when the ""good guys"" have guns, too.

Further, the ""left"" isn't trying to get rid of all guns. They have no problem with reasonably using guns for personal defense--if you're at home and your house gets broken into, for example. Guns are also a fine recreational activity as long as they are effectively regulated to make sure there is safe use of them. We use a similar argument for cars to restrict people's rights on purchasing and use based on arbitrary discriminations and don't blink an eye. But if you are thinking that you must oppose gun control because there's a hypothetical where you get mugged and the police don't teleport in front of you and a gun will prevent that...well I hate to break it to you but lots of people with guns get mugged, or beat up, or shot, or killed, or literally whatever crime you're thinking of. There is NO evidence that having a gun on your person makes you immune to crime. 

My advice? Drop the political compass ideology nonsense and read a book on criminal justice. There's going to be lots of options at your local library. It's perfectly defensible to disbelieve in gun control. But it's important to have a good argument for defending your beliefs, and right now the way you get that is by reading some better quality information."
479,"What is democracy, and why are democratically elected leaders accused of being dictators?","Now, I hope I'm not breaking rule #4 by this, but I not going to beat around the bush and hide the elephant in the room for long: I am asking this question in the context of the recent [general elections in Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Hungarian_parliamentary_election). In the wake of Viktor Orbán winning his fourth consecutive term, I have seen people - both Hungarians and foreigners alike - accuse him of being a *""dictator""* in spite of being democratically elected, or even the country as a whole of being a *""dictatorship""* despite just having had a democratic election. In fact, I have seen people compare us unfavorably to other countries, calling those other countries *""more democratic""*. Ironically, Ukraine is one of those countries, despite having banned all opposition parties.

What does *""more democratic""* mean? I could understand, if someone said that Switzerland (a direct democracy) is more democratic than Hungary (a representative democracy), but in these cases, it's nearly always parliamentary representative democracies being compared.

In fact, what does *""democracy""* even mean, if having a multi-party parliamentary system and democratically electing the ruling party and the prime minister is somehow not enough to qualify?

Can someone please give me a proper definition of *""democracy""*, and what makes a country qualify as one?"
480,Whats the diffrence between being right and being liberal?,"Being right-wing isn't inherently liberal. In the american context that was the traditional understanding. Typically though (and the American right-wing has since shifted to this) the Right is illiberal, favoring authoritarianism, minority rule, stratified social classes and a distinctly non-liberal economy, either in the form of an autarkic shell state (little to no trade outside the world) or in the form of aggressive mercantilism (state-backed private enterprise to compete with the outside world)."
481,What makes some countries more corrupt than others?,"Part of it has to do with where the wealth comes from. If it's a natural resource like gold or oil, it's easier for a few individuals to exploit.

Institutions play a role. The weaker and younger governments/courts/police forces/civil society are, the more people are willing to and able to get away with corruption."

484,"Why isn't the US or the west financing major infra projects in the developing world, as China is?","Of course, much of the conversation around this issue is poorly understood opinion nonsense. So the basic premise of your question here isn't really a very good one. The US DOES invest in other countries quite substantially. 

For example, do you remember Lindsey Graham and others decrying the budget ""paying for gender studies in Pakistan?"" It was a big thing a few years ago because it was absurd enough to get people angry over something that seems pretty obviously a dumb idea.

Of course, it actually wasn't as simple as Graham was suggesting. The foreign aid the US was sending to Pakistan wasn't for gender studies nor was it a blank check to the Pakistani government. Rather, the US had budgetary space carved out to support women's organizations in Pakistan, including some that focused on things like helping women get driver's licenses. This should be a pretty obvious thing Americans are happy to support--one of the reasons we don't fully get along with Pakistan is because of cultural and religious differences that have created a significantly less free and small-l liberal political system. Well, ensuring women have the same political and social freedoms as men is about as direct a way to work on changing that as can possibly exist. 

Another good example is NATO. NATO is essentially a foreign aid agreement where lots of countries band together in common purpose to protect their basic values both militarily and to a certain extent economically and politically. For a country like Germany or the UK where there's a lot of commonality and overlap already, this is mostly a matter of reinforcing tendencies already present, but in a country like Hungary, that is rapidly moving away from liberal democratic values, this collective authority is a form of foreign investment that is much more meaningful.

But to get to the later parts of your question, you may have noticed that these are two big time examples that have both seen major pushback from a portion of the American electorate. NATO has been under fire from some voters for ""not paying their fair share"" and, well, we already mentioned Graham's criticisms of encouraging American values in Pakistan. Essentially, we've seen these efforts curtailed a bit in recent years as American nationalism has become an increasingly significant part of the US political spectrum.

Part of that is justified--foreign aid isn't always productive, and anyone who remembers or studied Cold War history could tell you that. Whether it's Nixon style ""modernization theory"" or Carter style compassionate human rights focused foreign policy, history is full of recent examples of investments in foreign aid that didn't really work out. But those examples are largely overshadowed by the good examples--the Marshall Plan was literally ""hey let's give unlimited free money to Europe with no strings attached at all"" and it was probably the most successful foreign policy idea this country has ever had, directly contributing to the formation of NATO.

Essentially, you're asking a pretty complicated question. Right now there are a lot of Americans that want to focus more on domestic concerns--and they have a point. The US is lagging behind the rest of the Western world in most infrastructure metrics, and so even for some liberal folks it's a tough pill to swallow to fix issues in other societies without guarantees that they will bear fruit. But that whole thing implies that America used to be more willing to invest in foreign aid, and the demand certainly hasn't gone down.

So the talk about China ""taking over"" is certainly mostly done very poorly, but the basic point that China is filling the foreign aid void as America scales back its commitments isn't wrong. As Americans are less willing to take on risks that would expand NATO and maybe aggravate Russia or create a social security system in the Shah's Iran (only for it to revolt and become an US enemy), just to think of two examples, China is looking to expand its sphere of influence and is more willing to take those risks. Calling that ""taking over"" is a bit...limited, to be kind...but the point remains that right now the US-led global economic and political order represented by NATO is seeing some competition more robust than any point since the fall of the Soviet Union. That doesn't mean China will ""win,"" whatever that means, nor does it mean the West/US is screwed, but it does mean that our diplomats do need to consider that the American political and economic situation may not stay the way it is now without some effort on their part to maintain it."

486,What is the limit on who can become president?,"The reality of a lot of US law boils down to: “we’ll decide once it happen”. 

The law as it is does not stipulate what happens in this  exact scenario and would rely on basically a scenario to test it, and be raised with the Court to decide. (And obviously a tough scenario, hard to imagine the public voting for someone who felt so seriously as to renounce their citizenship). 

That being said, the US is actually rare in this scenario - the larger number of countries in fact won’t allow citizens to renounce citizenship if it would render them stateless. In the case of those that don’t allow dual citizenship, naturalisation usually will either just not be a possibility or has a mechanism to take a seamless transition (often a form of conditional approval, to take effect the moment you renounce your prior citizenship). Though there are exceptions."
487,Can a country be formally kicked out of NATO?,"There is no formal mechanism to do so within the founding documents of NATO. I.e. there is no clause within the treaty to say, under these circumstances or through these mechanisms, a member can be formally expelled. 

That being said, this was a question a few times, notably during the initial negotiations around NATO’s founding when the Canadian proposed including an expulsion clause. But more recently when concerns rose over Turkey’s engagement in Syria and Kurdistan, a common argument raised was that though there was no mechanism to do so, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (basically the rules on how to do rules) included the clause on “material breach” which in simple terms is to say that if one party of a treaty so seriously violated the fundamental aspects of the treaty, then the treaty could be, by unanimous consent of all but the violating party, be suspended in whole or in part. In NATO’s case, the treaty involves a long affirmation of the principles and values of the alliance - if the other members considered a country in egregious violation of these principles and values codified in the founding treaty, they could, according to the argument, unanimously consent that the violating party failed to meet those basic tenets of the treaty and thus suspend it in part (namely, the part that would include the violating country)"
488,Does China have grants funding students to work in US/Canadian biolabs?,"If it was money offered to a Chinese student (those students who are chosen for the grants) to help them go to Canada to study, that would all be done in China and in Chinese, so it makes sense that you can’t find info on it. I would think the student would need to prove to the grant provider (the govt I guess) in China his or her enrollment and maybe more info about the Canadian school. But they would not need to notify the Canadian school, professor, or classmates that they receive a grant from their home country. Canadian universities give transcripts, etc to a student for a small fee and they do not ask what the document will be used for. Sounds like something that could easily be true."

491,Could the Ukraine establish a No-fly zone using a Private Military Company?,"So this question could likely be broadened to ask ""Can Ukraine hire private military to reinforce their armed forces?""

For the no-fly zone, there are SOME private forces that have war-ready planes. But there are three major issues with using them. The first is these forces aren't large. No private company (or even multiple private companies) is going to have enough planes to rival Russia. So any hired force would be at a pretty big numerical disadvantage off the bat. Ukraine has hundreds of planes, Russia has thousands, so hiring 50 planes won't make a huge difference 

The second is supplying these planes. It's unlikely neighboring countries would allow a private military force to set up base within their borders with the current situation, and there are no private aircraft carriers in the world, so these planes would all have to be housed and supplied within and by Ukraine. While the US and other countries will supply Ukraine with weapons, supplying private citizens to fight Russia could escalate the situation, as that could be interpreted as (the US for example) hiring and supplying a private army to fight Russia. So ensuring these private planes are equipped with fuel, weapons, and maintenance would be far from assured even if they were hired.

The third is actually getting these pilots to fly. Most of the private air force units (at least in the US) do training missions alongside the US and other Western militaries. While I won't say impossible, I'd be surprised if these private pilots would agree to enter an active warzone where they are severely outnumbered to enforce a no-fly zone, especially since many of these pilots may be out of practice with live missiles and actual combat experience. It's one thing to have private pilots flying training missions versus them agreeing to enter a warzone (that frankly isn't directly in their benefit)."
492,What is the source of European economic power?,"A lot of the stuff needed to run the factories in the east is made in the west. Western investments are also oftentimes needed to build up factories + the factories that are already there wouldn't have anyone to sell to. I would hope that we could replace a lot of the current production with machines, although I wouldn't be too sure about that working. The west (including South America) also produces huge amounts of food, so I don't think we'd be entirely lost there. I would count Taiwan and probably Japan to the west, meaning the east would lack a huge amount of technologie.  
At the end of the day, everyone would be f\*\*\*\*\*, not just the west."
493,Are Sanders and AOC Democratic Socialists (like they say over and over and over) or Social Democrats?,"They are both Democratic Socialists, because that's what they consistently call themselves, and that's their primary target. It doesn't matter how you define those terms, they are what they say they are... so they are Democratic Socialists, regardless of what policies they present or votes they make."
494,"Which US Presidents have had a second term better than their first? Why don’t any Presidents go one and done, or the parties withdraw support?",One of the presidents in the 1840's did a one and done.  I forget which one exactly;  the short of it is he campaigned on a set of 4 goals for his administration.  He accomplished them all.  So he declined to run again because he already did everything he wanted to do.
495,serious question why dont african countries that are allies unite into one country?,"Countries like Nigeria already have hundreds of ethnic groups inside of them, and that makes them very prone to instability and slows down development. The Congo for example has been at war with its own minorities since it's independence. 

It's like uniting all of Europe at any point in history before the 20th/21st century when there is/was a common enemy as an excuse. But then add in religious divides, stark differences in wealth, completely different political ideologies and economies, and the natural instability that comes with extreme poverty. 

Basically impossible. Many African countries have only maintained their colonial borders due to outside interventions. Something like this would collapse immediately"

498,Why the questions about hot political issues in supreme court confirmation hearings ?,[removed]
499,"According to the Ukrainian government, over 12 assassination attempts have been made against Volodymyr Zelensky. Why would Russia prefer to assassinate him instead of capturing him?","A comparison to Iraq is a bit silly. The US took out the Iraqi army in all of 25 minutes, more or less. The entire country was occupied basically without any serious resistance.

Zelensky is mounting an effective defense that most experts believed impossible. Not only that, ideologically he's considered a hero and is easily winning the ""who does the world like"" side of the war. Russia wants to take him out because they're confident of one of three things: 1) he would be less effective at leading the military defense of Ukraine, 2) he would be less effective at winning the hearts and minds of the global community, or 3) losing Zelensky would be a strong enough blow to morale of the troops and citizens that Russia would be able to conquer the country more effectively."
500,Why the resurgence of homophobia?,"Well, for one thing, 2016 was not that long ago. The homophobic politicians and ideologues didn't really go away. They just put that issue on the back burner for a while and have now picked it back up with a new argument.

In 2012 the argument was hyperfocused on marriage, in 2016 on workplace and commercial discrimination. Now the argument is focused on schools and kids, they're saying, ""we don't oppose LGBT+ rights; we just don't want our kids exposed ""to sexual content"" in schools.""

This fits in really well with the Republican's broader midterm strategy. Ever since the first school closures at the beginning of the pandemic, Conservatives have been harnessing parents' (and non-parents) anger at the (real and imagined) failures of the education system. They started by focusing on reopening schools, then they added CRT after the George Floyd Protests, not they are adding the anti-LGBT+ rhetoric as well.

The other big difference is that Trans issues were not really a focus back in 2016, but they have come to the forefront today. While Homophobia has gone down dramatically in the last decade, Transphobia is declining at a much lower rate, and many people are hearing about or meeting Trans people for the first. The issues around HRT, GCS, and Puberty blockers also line up  well with the Conservative Covid/Vaccine skeptic rhetoric."
501,Is it fair game to assassinate the leader of an invading country?,"It's important to understand in questions like this that there is no unit of sovereignty higher than a country. That's why we can't make war illegal. Who would enforce it? And how could they do that without the consent and buy in of a country, which means the other organization doesn't matter anyway?

So in that sense, technically a country can do whatever it wants. Putin CAN invade Ukraine, and other countries CAN get very mad about it and do everything they can to hobble Putin's efforts. Ukraine CAN assassinate Putin, and Russia (or other countries) CAN retaliate by prosecuting that person for murder and taking diplomatic or military action as well.

The only thing that can hold a country's action in check is another country and that's more in a ""let's both put the safety on at the same time"" kind of way rather than a ""I'm putting the safety on for you/before I give this back to you"" kind of way. In this case, I'm pretty sure the entire world except for Russia would turn a blind eye if Ukrainian operatives took out Putin. But if Iraqis killed Bush in 2003 that wouldn't have gone over as well. There isn't a hard and fast rule here because the unit of sovereignty we're playing with is at the country level."
502,"Why is Carlson is asking for Ketanji Brown Jackson's LSAT scores? If they hey turn out to be low, isn't that just proof that affirmative action works if she graduated at the top of her class?","Well yes, it absolutely would show that. There is no other logical conclusion that could be made. So if there's such a clear flaw in the point being made, then why would Carlson make it?

Because it's not about that point at all. Carlson isn't engaging in a good faith examination of Brown's qualifications relative to other candidates. If he was, then he'd be just as upset about Clarence Thomas' selection and I've never seen him get bent out of shape about that. Hell, even Barrett was (comparatively) poorly qualified for SCOTUS nomination when she got the nod.

Carlson is looking for a way to cast aspersions on Brown's nomination, but because she's a fairly well rounded and solid pick, this is the best line of attack Carlson can come up with. So he spins it as much as he needs to get people talking, because that's what Carlson does. It's a pattern he's used time and time again."
503,Does 'the 1%' mean the top 1% by annual income or the top 1% by net worth?,"According to the Cambridge dictionary of English: the richest one percent of people, who are said to have most of the money, property, and power in society. So it sounds like net worth not income."
504,What is this called?,"There isn't much of a name for this position because it's not a very stable position for anyone to hold. Progressive economic issues sort of require an openness to social change in at least some areas, which means being socially conservative gets in the way of being economically progressive. Basically, believing one forces you to abandon the other.

Economically conservative but socially progressive doesn't really run into this problem. It's essentially ""you do whatever you want, but do it with your own resources."" It's very possible to jealously guard your own money but be perfectly happy with society doing whatever it wants outside of that island. It's not really possible to believe that economics should aggressively solve the problems of society and also believe that society shouldn't change.

And I get you used to believe that, but the point is used to. Most folks who hold this contradictory position tend to either be not very well informed about the issues they are talking about, or they are in a period of transition where you're still getting to a consistent belief system. There just hasn't been a population or political perspective that has been able to consistently hold these beliefs simultaneously."
505,Did the United States want to setup a military base in Crimea during the years of 2008-2020?,"No.

The value of Crimea as a base would be as a *naval* base. However, the U.S. can't move military vessels through Turkish waters to enter the Black Sea, so Crimea doesn't have any real value.

In theory, the U.S. could establish an air or ground base. However, those are invariably placed in the hinterlands where land costs are cheaper. Also, before U.S. troops are deployed into a friendly nation, a status of forces agreement is always negotiated - and no attempt was ever made to do so."
506,Is Chile now weak military-wise?,"First thing first: 

>Years ago Chile did very well military and fought against 3 countries by itself.

Which are the 3 countries you mention in your statement? The Pacific War was between Perú and Bolivia, on one side, and Chile on the other.

Chile's military is not weak, it has a decent budget and a capable navy. The country is ranked 47 in the global military ranking made by Global Firepower, below Perú and Argentina, and on top of Bolivia. Besides that, Chile, as all the other southamerican countries, has a ""dissuasion"" oriented military, prepared only for the defense of the territorial integrity of the country. Southamética remains, to this day, the most peacefull region in the planet. This increases the further south you go, reaching it's cenit in the southern cone. This means neither Chile, nor Argentina, Uruguay or Paraguay would support an invasion.

>Argentina has a dubious status

Care to explain what you mean? Argentina and Chile have a really close relationship. The last episode of tensions between the countries happened in the late 70s, and since both countries regained democracy relations began to thrive. The frontrier passes are always busy, since people from both sides go to the other country daily."
507,When will the people from Latin America assimilate in the USA?,"What do you mean they haven't assimilated.  By the first generation, nearly all of those folks speak fluent English, go to school just like anybody.  They work all kinds of jobs, join all kinds of clubs and churches.  We have piñatas and missions and a ton of Spanish words in our language.  Not to mention that there are something like forty billion Mexican restaurants in the United States.

You say they haven't assimilated.  I say *this is what assimilation looks like.*"
508,What do democrats see in Liz Cheney?,"Liz Cheney is one of the few remaining ""moderate"" Republicans (what many republicans would now call RINOs (Republican In Name Only)). Remember when Trump was nominated in 2016, there were MANY Republicans who spoke out against him: his rhetoric, his inexperience, his policies, etc. But after his election, most of the Republicans shifted significantly further right when they realized he actually won, and was actually very popular with the Republican voters. There was still a contingency of moderate Republicans from 2016-2020, but they were slowly eliminated from the government (people like Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Justin Amash,  Adam Kinzinger, etc.). Now there seem to be a handful of Republicans left who haven't committed to the Trump-style politics and policies, and Liz Cheney is one of them.

While Democrats disagree with her on most policy issues, they ""respect"" her as a politician and a person for taking (what they would call) reasonable stances. She is on the January 6th commission, has spoken out against Trump publicly on controversial subjects, and seems to harken back to the Republican party of the 2000's instead of what we have now.

It's the same way Republicans ""like"" Gabbard. Gabbard has few policy similarities with Republicans, but many Republicans see her as a reasonable, moderate Democrat, and would support her style of politics over many of the other Democratic leaders and politicians we see today. In 2020, many Republicans said they would consider voting for a ""reasonable"" Democrat like Gabbard over Trump."
509,"Why is the Biden Administration turning to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for oil instead of US oil producers?","The OPEC cartel intentionally produces less oil than they could to drive up prices and earn themselves more money.  They have wells that they could activate very quickly to increase production, but that they usually leave idle.

Whereas in the US there isn't spare production capacity like that lying around, or at least not much.  It'd take years for US to increase production by much, and given the expense of producing oil in the US many of them are reluctant to invest that money as there were some major losses a few years ago from investing in US oil production."
510,How popular are the Dombass separatists?,"Unsatisfyingly, there's no clean answer I don't think. 

So maybe helpfully, maybe unhelpfully, here's a few cuts on things we do know, especially compared to Crimea, and reasons those aren't necessarily good ways of proxy analysing it. 

To start, Putin's argument with Crimea (and with Luhansk and Donetsk) is largely some form of a 'defence and reintegration of Russians'. Crimea and Lunhansk / Donetsk are pretty different here already. While Crimea, as of 2014 polling, is predominantly ethnically Russian (saving discussion on how that came to be for another day) with \~65% ethnic Russians in Crimea (vs around 15% ethnic Ukrainian and 12% Tatars). Luhansk and Donetsk are a more even cut (47-48, 48-49) between those reporting themselves as ethnically Russian or ethnically Ukrainian. They are however, predominantly Russian speaking as their primary language - ethnic Russians and Ukrainians alike (for the most part). That's the slight shift in the rhetoric from Putin on 'defending' or 'liberating' Russians in Ukraine - while the argument was heavily drawing on ethnic majority in Crimea, that's a weaker argument in Luhansk and Donetsk - where the argument tends to draw on other gripes around policies the Ukrainian government tried to undertake on language recognition. That all being said, neither ethnicity nor language group necessarily determines support. Ethnic Russians aren't inherently going to support breaking away to Russia, many ethnic Russians will be proudly and patriotically Ukrainian by nationality and take that identity first before ethnicity. Russian-speakers, even those upset by those language recognition policies, won't necessarily want to breakaway either. And to be frank, there probably are some number of ethnic Ukrainians in those regions who may actually support breaking away too. All to say, useful to note the difference between Luhansk and Donetsk vs Crimea but ethnic or linguistic lines aren't necessarily a trustworthy proxy on support for separatist movements. 

Polling always has difficulties though can usually control for some those to a large extent to get at more comfortable numbers. I don't think we have anything close to that here. In part because there are dynamics on who can reliably conduct a valid poll - which is just logistically difficult here given pressure on voicing opinions, logistical hurdles of trying to poll people in an active warzone, and a bunch of other potentially skewing dynamics (trying to go pre-active conflict has its own issues too). One of the more frequently cited polls from IRI got a sample from the Donbas that was controlled in 2017 by Ukraine still - which obviously is not great at getting to the core of separatist controlled areas and the opinions there - where most of the support for separatist movements would be. But it does include overwhelming support for maintaining the whole of the Donbas region in Ukraine in the areas they did poll (again, which were the Ukrainian controlled territories so obviously huge asterisk) at around 73%. 

Apart from that, what we have is the referenda and counter-referenda, none of which can or are viewed by anyone close to impartial with any grain of credibility from either side. 

How much support they actually have within the separatist controlled regions or even if that's a majority, we probably can't know. Though probably safe to say, there likely is a significant contingent of support, but probably also less than those separatist movements would argue there is."
511,How do I better follow what is happening in the three branches of government on a weekly basis?,"[Rollcall](https://rollcall.com) is great for following Congress — they keep the reporting focused mostly on the technical, procedural aspects of lawmaking.

512,How many bills pass unanimously in the senate and then fail to pass in the house?,"To be frank, I can't remember (nor can I find) a scenario like that. If you cared enough, you should ask that ""someone"" to source their claim, because as far as I'm aware it's not true. Any bill that get unanimous support in either the House or Senate isn't likely to get shot down in the other chamber.

Since this ""someone"" is making the claim, you should ask for proof. I'd be intrigued if they can fine any (let alone enough to support the claim it ""happens all the time"")."
513,Why has no one stepped up to be a Intermediary between Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict diplomatically a-la French president Sarkozy stepping up when there was the war between Russia and Georgia in 2008?,Macron has been doing this for over a month.  He just had a lengthy phone call with Putin a few days ago.
514,Why is the South so much more conservative than the rest of the country?,"It's driven by white supremacy. The south had slavery of course, but after the civil war, there was continuing exploitation of black laborers by wealthy southern whites. It was not quite slavery, but wealthy southern whites encouraged the racism because it made black workers easier exploit. The racism crippled the labor movement as white laborers were more reluctant to form coalitions and unions with black laborers.

Cotton farming was still a big thing in the south after the war, and instead of using black slaves, they used black sharecroppers. They were technically free but they tended to be underpaid, and many were snared in debt bondage (a system which is always rigged such that the debt peon never gets out of debt).

Have you heard of the Great Migration?  In the early 20th century, black people in the south migrated in large numbers to the north to work in factories in Chicago, Detroit, and other places, where wages were better.  Southern farmers and industrialists were furious about this because it resulted in a labor shortage. Southern governments tried to stem the flow by forbidding northern labor agents from talking to black people, they shut down train stations near black communities, and sometimes police would just show up at train stations and tear up the tickets of black people trying to leave.  But there wasn't all that much they could do and some white employers were (gasp!) forced to raise wages.

The pre-war slaveowners encouraged racism because that made slavery morally and politically acceptable.  The post-war white capitalists continued to encourage racism because that made it easier to exploit both white and black laborers (but blacks in particular).

I think the invention of cotton-harvesting machines contributed to a lessening of racism.  It definitely made southern cotton farmers less upset about the black labor emigration.  Cotton harvesting machines made cotton farming less labor-intensive and therefore reduced the demand for exploited labor.  Mechanization in other forms of agriculture must have had a similar effect.

I think that in the latter half of the 20th century, southern racism mostly coasted on inertia and has been going down.  Things down south are definitely nicer than it was back in the 70s."
515,Why did the USA not receive sanctions or international backlash after the illegal invasion of Iraq?,"Neither the invasion of Ukraine or Iraq was 'illegal' because there's no such concept without some body to enforce law. So when people claim either is 'illegal', they're simply expressing disagreement with a certain government's policy (incorrectly).

In terms of sanctions or international backlash, it's not too hard to see why. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is viewed as an incremental threat directed at Europe and Russia is not trusted on the international stage. In contrast, the U.S. invasion of Iraq was viewed as a way of removing a government that most nations viewed as illegitimate and the U.S. *is* trusted on the world - no one seriously believed the U.S. was attempting to colonize Iraq."
516,Iraq fell out of the news after ISIS was expelled. How is the country doing these days? Is the oil industry doing well and paying for the country's expenses? How stable is the government?,"Things are somewhat better, with very strong emphasis on the 'somewhat'. There is no raging sectarian civil war, but that's about it. Hatreds between the Sunnis, Shias and Kurds are as deep as ever. Most of the Shia (except Muqtada al-Sadr and his supporters) are marionettes dancing to the tunes of Tehran. Most of the Sunni still harbour nostalgia for the reign of Saddam, when they were at the top of the food chain. And the Kurds are independent in all but name. Corruption is as rife as ever. Government jobs are doled out as patronage, rather than being filled on the basis of merit. The sectarian 'muhasasa' political system (identical to that of Lebanon, which is currently famous for all the wrong reasons) has ensured the creation of sectarian fiefdoms."
517,"What are the differences between Liberals, Leftists, Progressives and Socialists?","Liberalism is a political movement that is all about individual freedom and rights.

Progressivism is a political movement that cares about social reform and progression, a movement forward contrary to conservatism which prefers to keep things as they are.

Socialism is a wide political idea that in its core cares about social ownership of the means of production.

A leftist is basically someone who is more towards the left side of the political spectrum in the place they currently live in.

> Where I'm from

See, that's where things get confusing. Because political parties nowadays are all about framing and political ideology is not something that is very strong amongst the people anymore.

On the international political spectrum both the DNC and GOP (assuming you're from the US) would be right-wing parties. But since the DNC is ""lesser right-wing"" in the American spectrum they get called leftists.

Both parties are also liberals since both care a lot about individual freedom. One more to the other, on certain aspects, but they still care about it.

The DNC are called socialists as a form of attack because during the Red Scare in the US and the days of McCarthyism the term 'socialist' basically became a slur for people on the left. It's ironic because the average socialist hates the DNC just as much as the GOP. That's because as a liberal party they think private ownership of property is an individual right that society isn't allowed to interfere with whereas socialist think that the private property should be under democratic control of the masses."
518,How can I tell if the news I receive is subject to propaganda?,"Can you access foreign news?  In China, they block foreign websites like Reuters, and using a VPN to get around the block is illegal.  In America, you can access foreign news such as The Guardian and BBC.  Most Americans choose to ignore them, but that's another matter.

Also, look for disagreement among the news organizations. In America, you get lots of news sources that disagree with each other.  The fact that CNN and Fox News say different things and love to shriek at each other is at least a sign that the press in America is still free. By contrast, in China all the news sites agree that Xi Jinping is a wonderful man."
519,Why do people have such rigid partisan views?,"Most people's political opinions are not based on their own reasoned analysis but rather group affinity. What they believe is what the group believes and they value group membership more than they value the practical application of policy.

Even if you start from a reasoned position on one particular issue, the community you find yourself in tends to influence your beliefs on all other issues more than the people on the other side do.

Imagine for a moment you feel strongly that gay people shouldn't be subject to random beatings for holding hands in public, but you don't have any strong feelings about abortion either way. Your first belief is going to lead you to associate with gay rights activists. But despite the fact it's tough to imagine two issues less linked than abortion and gay rights, spending all that time around gay rights activists is likely to make you care much more about expansive abortion rights."
520,Could a country seize a Russian embassy and move the Russians to a basement somewhere?,"Could they technically? Sure - in the way theoretically a country could almost do anything - but for what gain and for what cost. 

I think first there has to be the understanding of how embassies work and what their status is. Embassy buildings aren't (*usually*) buildings just picked out and handed out by the receiving country. I.e. France wouldn't be 'giving diplomats a basement or a warehouse anyway. Countries find their own embassy locations (though sometimes, especially in cases of particular relationships with particularly impressive embassies, they are leased via the government - think of embassies located in historical buildings or locations owned by the national government for heritage protection). 

The big thing is, embassies are also protected under international law. While it's a common misconception that they're 'soil of their country' - that's actually not the case. That being said, they are guaranteed in international law from intrusion or disruption from the hosting government. That usually manifests as basically something closer to diplomatic immunity within the bubble of the embassy but not necessarily total sovereignty of that land. For example, Julian Assange pretty famously took up residence in the Ecuadorian embassy, with their permission, in London - to avoid arrest and extradition by the UK. Even though the UK police said they could (they couldn't), they weren't actually able to just get a warrant and go in and arrest him the way they would if he was just in a regular British office building or flat. There are international legal protection that protect a hosting country from enforcing their laws into those protected buildings of diplomatic business. That being said, when Ecuador rented that building, the land does not magically become territory that belongs to Ecuador - it's just given extra protections. International law equally protects diplomats themselves. So while people usually see the annoyances of diplomatic immunity (i.e. diplomats parking in no parking zones in New York or some more egregious cases) - it is meant to serve as a universal mutual understanding that diplomats are there on behalf of their country, to represent their country diplomatically - and thus should be protected. 

So to your question, could a country just forcibly shut down an embassy? Sure but it would come at huge diplomatic cost. Your embassies and your diplomatic staff are now at risk and you would be seen as a clear aggressor. And if for some reason you tried to forcibly move the staff to another location, it's borderline kidnapping of diplomatic officials. Wars have been started for that. 

That being said, governments can and do eject or expel ambassadors and sometimes wider diplomatic staff. But that's done more professionally than to seize and shut down an embassy."
521,Who decides each individual country's oil production at OPEC?,"OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), 13 countries in all, negotiates among themselves to decide the output.

The intention is to keep prices at a maximum. It would be illegal for any group of companies to do this in most countries, because it's a cartel, but this is above that type of law.

Sometimes, the members squabble, and one or more of them will refuse to stick to the limits. In that case, Saudi Arabia might deliberately hold back in order to compensate, thereby keeping prices high.

It's hardly a perfect system for the OPEC countries, but it does work in their favour. Of course, it's awful for everyone else.

There's a silver lining, though: By keeping prices high, people and companies are more inclined to invest in green energy, which is helpful for the environment."

What I have heard is that the Russian military is underprepared and undersupplied, but it is just a larger and better-equipped army than Ukraine's so despite the failures of planning it still has the advantage"
525,How bad will it be for the west if it was China handing out sanctions?,I imagine it would look like mutually assured destruction.  I'm willing to bet that 10's of millions of Chinese jobs depend on exports.
526,How can NATO intervene outside of NATO members?,"""International law"" is what nation states make of it. There's not some world government that enforces treaty conditions, it is up to the parties to resolve disputes and decide how things are meant to be interpreted. International organizations like the WTO, UN, etc., serve as forums and arbitration venues, but only have power as far as the parties in dispute agree to follow it's judgement. This is why you virtually  ever see winning armies at Hague, why the US likes dragging smaller countries through the WTO (""accept the judgement or we'll inflict far worse economic issues on you anyway""), etc.

I say all this most to say that...NATO went to Bosnia and other places abroad because the members in NATO agreed it was a good idea to do so. There are arguments to be made (and I'm sure were made) that instability on it's periphery is not good for the NATO security situation. But ultimately, the members NATO wanted to get involved and thought it would be a good idea to do so as a unit, not individually"
527,How would free public college change the way public colleges are governed.,"State universities already receive significant funding from the federal government through Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, parent PLUS loans, federal work study, the GI Bill, etc. The cheaper a campus, and the lower the income of the community it serves, the more likely it is that most students are using federal funding to pay for most or even all of their tuition, and we don't really see the federal government exerting more control over those schools than they do over higher-tuition flagship universities with a lot of out-of-state and foreign students who aren't using financial aid. So free public college wouldn't necessarily translate into more control, it would depend on how the program was implemented. 

It would be pretty reasonable for the government to put some kind of restrictions on how much universities can increase their tuition if the government is footing the bill, like how Medicare and the VA can set the rates they'll reimburse healthcare providers so they don't bleed them dry. So in that sense, the schools' budgets could be impacted which can obviously translate into a lot of decisions. But state governments and market factors (schools know they can't just like, quadruple their tuition overnight if they don't want to lose all their students) already govern tuition increases, so that wouldn't be a significant change. 

Because most colleges already rely on federal government funding to such a great extent, they're used to cooperating with provisions like non-discrimination laws, staying accredited, Title IX, etc, and their states probably already have similar requirements. So that's not going to change. 

Theoretically, the government could add other requirements to get the money, either up front or over time. But they'd still be governed by the Constitution (so they probably couldn't get away with making restrictions on free speech or assembly a prerequisite for securing funding). And state universities have a fair amount of power to advocate for their own interests. If some random congressman decides they're going to stick an amendment on some budget bill saying that every college needs to add an Icelandic Studies major if they want to keep getting funding, you can bet that every representative with a public college or university in their district (which is pretty much all of them) will be getting calls from administrators, professors, students, the owners of small businesses that serve students, parents, alumni, etc letting them know what the impact would be. Conservatives hate unfunded mandates on state government institutions, and liberals hate restrictions on student rights and academic freedom, so I don't see anything but the most reasonable restrictions getting through."
528,How does the US primary election work?,"Each state is different. There are *open primaries*, *closed primaries*, and *semi-closed primaries*, and each state usually has one of those three options.

In an open primary, on the day of the election, you get to select one party's ballot and vote in that primary, regardless of your political affiliation status.

In a closed primary, you must be registered with the party ahead of time in order to vote in that party's primary.

Semi-closed is kind of a middle ground between these. If you are affiliated with a party, you can only vote in that party's primary, but unaffiliated voters may select which ballot they want to use.

Almost always, even in an open primary, the thing stopping Republicans from voting in a Democratic primary or vice versa is that by doing so, they give up their voice in their own primary."
529,UAE and Israel's agreement from 2020 - why did it happen?,"It's still probably a little too early to get a lot of good historical scholarship on this. I agree with the basic point of your question that this seemed to be a bit odd and the causes for such an agreement were not immediately clear. Top policy makers and historical experts could probably answer this reasonably well now but those folks often aren't writing for popular audiences, and 2 years isn't really enough time for it to be historical enough to start getting written about outside of academic inner circles."

Edit: 

So, even quick google searches will bring up numerous incidents. For example, [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/asia/india-pakistan-border-ceremony.html), written in January 2020, states: ""Last February, as part of their chronic feud over the disputed region of Kashmir, their warplanes bombed each other’s territory, the first time two nuclear-armed powers had ever done that."" Wikipedia even has [a page over skirmishes on the border.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Pakistan_border_skirmishes) The conflict is an ongoing argument over control over the Kashmir region.

532,Would the Keystone XL pipeline mainly supply refined product to other countries?,"The idea is that the refined product would be sold to whomever want's to buy it.

534,Was Russia/Putin Prepared for these sanctions over Ukraine?,"Prior to this invasion, sanctions to this degree of severity not only had never been applied before, but there was serious doubt this extent of sanctions would even be reasonably possible. I can't see inside Putin's head, but given the unprecedented scale of these sanctions and the amount of corporate self-sacrifice necessary to achieve them, it's pretty easy to say with confidence that Putin couldn't possibly have expected this much hurt. He knew for sure there would be some sanctions, and that they would be pretty severe, but he definitely didn't expect THIS."
535,Were Iraqis hopeful about the US invasion in 2003?,"""Welcome"" is a strong word. But the historical scholarship has more or less reached the conclusion that immediately after Hussein was deposed, there was an air of hopeful optimism that the US would help rebuild the country. While Hussein had a period where he was an effective if repressive ruler who clearly made the lives of his citizens better, that all but disappeared after he started the disastrous Iran-Iraq War and the economy and society never recovered. 

Opinion polls aren't really the right way to go about this. I'm not sure most American-based polling institutions would even know how to accurately poll Iraqis and account for the varying factors required to get a representative result. Fortunately, we do have good traditional historical primary and secondary sources that suggest Iraqis weren't exactly happy to be conquered, but saw an opportunity in having America and its immense resources ostensibly willing to rebuild the country.

However, whatever goodwill did exist was quickly extinguished as the US made policy mistake after policy mistake over the course of the actual occupation. What should have been a chance to repeat the Germany/Japan magic was instead tapping into the failures of Cuba and the Philippines. The insurgency was not present from day one. It was a reaction to US occupation after it flubbed the chance to get it right.

There are a number of excellent sources on this topic. One of the best ones that I've read is Rajiv Chandrasekaran's *Life in the Emerald City*. It's shorter and more approachable than the ordinary history tome because it was written by a journalist who was in Iraq at the time. It may not have the deep historical dives of Lawrence Wright's *The Looming Tower* or Douglas Little's *American Orientalism* but it has enough detail to make the argument well. The historical evidence here that Bush had better choices on his desk and chose the wrong ones is extremely well documented, so basically any modern history book discussing the Iraq War will make the same basic argument. Just heading to your local library will unearth a lot of other good options."
536,Why is Alexei Navalny allowed to write from jail?,"You're hitting on it with your final question. The people being ruled, no matter what system, want a certain amount of freedom and consistency in the law. Crack down on those things too hard, and the people will fight back, causing the government to potentially be overthrown and replaced. In democracies this is a pretty basic idea, but it applies to autocracies as well. Freedom is a spectrum, not a binary. 

So by jailing Navalny, Putin's regime benefits from quashing some dissent, but play that hand too hard and it back fires. How much you can do that depends on the regime. Stalin had no problem murdering folks capriciously just for basic disagreement. His immediate successors could not get away with that even within the same political system. Russia's current government is nominally more committed to basic freedoms than the USSR was, which Putin can only go so far in quashing dissent. This appears to be a good example."
537,"What does eastern Europe mean by ""the West?""","\> Is it just the political ties of countries in western Europe? That seems odd because why does it matter where the U.N. or whatever is located?

""The West"" is a phrase that makes a lot of sense if you've read history books talking about how the modern geopolitical understanding has developed. ""The West"" isn't *directly* a shorthand for ""western civilization"" but it's pretty close. The modern understanding of ""the West"" is basically an evolution of folks who have embraced the legacy and tradition of democracy, starting in Athens, heading through Rome, towards Enlightenment Europe and political structures that embraced those values. 

So basically, it includes all the countries that have their basis in democracy stemming from the Enlightenment or want to do that. The US and western Europe are obviously thought leaders in this coalition, especially the major powers like the US, UK, France, and Germany. Obviously a country like Canada--based on UK political principles and friends with other Western countries and geographically in the heart of the west--is a part, too. The EU and especially NATO, also is largely committed to those values, so a country like Poland that has a bit of history going both ways but has recently been committed to NATO and the EU, would also be pretty clearly Western. 

But what if a country like Turkey joined the EU? There are very few cultural connections between Turkey and most of the heart of the West. Ethnically it's the same story. Even from a geographical perspective, they're not very ""west"" at all, and the values of the political system aren't fully in alignment with traditional western values. But if they joined EU, that's very clearly binding them to the West, so how much does that matter? A country like Israel shares many of those same concerns, but they're clearly part of the West as well. Countries like Ukraine and Moldova and Georgia are also traditionally not really aligned with the West but here they are wanting to join the EU...so at what point have you crossed the tipping point into being Western? It's not entirely clear.

\> But Russia or Poland or Ukraine seem way more like America culturally than say Japan which is usually considered part of ""the West""

Japan's a bit unusual. Japan is a part of the West for two reasons. One, looking back pretty far in history, Japan was notably more imperialistic and friendly to Western countries than the rest of the continent. Literally, Japan sought to be known as the ""white"" people of Asia back in the late 1800s when white, Western colonialism was seen as a good thing. But far more importantly, after Japan lost WW2 their whole political system was rebuilt from the ground up with help from the American occupation, so their government is based on Western principles in a way the rest of Asia isn't. That alliance has persisted since then as well, so just makes sense to consider Japan as part of the West.

\> Do people in Russia worry about Asian cultural influence?

Japan and Russia actually border one another on Russia's eastern border. They have gone to war before. Teddy Roosevelt won a Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating peace between them in 1900ish. So now that Japan is part of the West, Russia is probably concerned about D) all of the above in terms of Japan.

\> because things like democracy or openness seem like objectively good things. Even if you are a dictator you would never openly say you are against freedom and equality.

Yes, but these things are always a spectrum, not a binary. Think about it this way. Getting promoted at work is objectively a good thing, but it can still come with negative aspects. More responsibility, more accountability, change in role, no longer doing some stuff you liked about your job, etc. True, you'll pretty much always take the promotion because more pay is the thing that matters the most, and if a boss tried to say you don't want a promotion/raise because it comes with those bad things you'd tell that boss to shove it, but the point is *good thing can have bad aspects*.

So yeah, dictators don't say democracy is bad...but they do say that democracy comes with other bad things like anxiety, depression, social fragmentation, inefficiency, etc. The point of a dictator is to find a way to give the minimum amount of freedom/equality/democracy/etc and they do that by emphasizing how giving those things is a double-edged sword. Putin pushing against the West is done to undermine the West's commitment to those values by ""exposing"" the flaws in those values."
538,How did Transnistria come to exist?,https://youtu.be/-wi0BJrKOwo this should answer your question
539,"How would a hypothetical transition from ""liberal democracy"" to ""social democracy"" affect the narrative of the (American-led) ""liberal world order"" discussed in foreign policy circles?","I see no reason why international liberalism and social democracy cannot coexist. My glimpse into this balance came during the 2020 Democratic Primaries. When asked a question about trade, Sen. Warren replied that she wanted ""unions at the table, environmentalists at the table, small businesses at the table."" I imagine that social democrats would have little problem with trade, so long as labor and environmental standards are met. 

While a social democratic world order may not include perfectly free trade, there's no reason why it wouldn't uphold the liberal principles of reciprocity and common identity, of institutionalism. Because social democracy has an inherently economic focus, that makes it rather adaptable to other ideologies on non-economic issues."
540,elected dictator?,"Is it possible for you to ask someone's permission to steal their stuff?

This is kind of the same problem. These are contradictions in terms. If they give you permission, it isn't really stealing, and if you're going to steal, why do you need permission?

Dictators aren't elected. If you're elected, then you're only a dictator if you stay in office even when you're not elected, which means no, a dictator can't be elected. Also why would someone run for office if they're going to be a dictator? What's the point of going through a campaign if you're just going to ignore the election process anyway?"
541,"Why does Putin continue to go through the song and dance of being ""democratically elected""?

That is the phrase used by political scientists to describe the Duterte and Erdogan regimes, among others. They face little institutional opposition and act extrajudicially, but maintain their power bases through the manipulated support of voters. Elections are irrelevant to power changes but important for maintaining the justification that the leader carries "" the will of the people."" If they can't show that they have the people's ""support,"" how can they justify their sweeping powers?"
542,Finland and Sweden joining Nato?,"It has been suggested that NATO could agree upon a fast track membership option for Finland and Sweden joining NATO, suggesting that Article 5 obligations could apply before full membership if the members agree. However, NATO must be acceded according to the democratic principles of each country so this could take some time. **Another option would be to seek security guarantees from individual NATO countries through treaties** as an interim measure such as the Taiwan-US agreement (Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty).  Certainly such an agreement with a few weighty NATO allies **US, France, UK, Germany etc. would deter a Russian invasion**.

543,Why is Japan so successful even though it is noncompetitive?,"The LDP is a bit of a different breed from most parties in that historically its often operated more as a conglomerate of parties instead of being one unified group.  The LDP was made up of numerous factions that all had their own ideologies, platform, and campaign workers and thus were basically parties within parties.  This has changed a bit due Koizumi-era empowering the LDP leader but even now the LDP is an extremely broad ""big tent"" party with no real comparable parties anywhere else and more comparable to coalition groups.  What this means is that elections were still competitive, but they were often between LDP members and not other parties.  Koizumi infamously lead the LDP to its largest electoral victory in the 2000s, while pretty much running on a ""anti-LDP"" platform as the whole election ended up being a war between the ""reformers"" and the ""traditional"" members of the LDP.  

What this also leads to is a single-party state where the party institutionally is comically weak historically.  You don't see the LDP swarming around a single leader or group, and historically the PM/Party Leader was more of a compromise candidate that all the factions approved of and acted as a good face of the party.  That position was a bit stronger under Koizumi and Abe, due to the fact those two were shockingly popular and lead to massive electoral victories, but generally most power is concentrated in local factions and clans that due most of the work and often will due their own thing.  This has prevented a real strong-man from taking control of the party, which is something that often happens in other single party states, and instead lead to a history of ""revolving door"" leadership that didn't end until Abe figured out the magical recipe for keeping your PM job in modern day Japan."
544,"Would America back Japan, South Korea or Taiwan?","The United States has formal treaties with both South Korea and Japan that compel the U.S. to defend those nations from external threats. These treaties are actually far stronger than NATO in terms of the obligations they place on the U.S.

Taiwan and the U.S. have no such treaty, nor does the U.S. station forces there. However, it has been the policy of the U.S. for many years to oppose any military incursions into Taiwan. Whether or not any particular President commits to this policy is anyone's guess."

547,"In 2018, the Trump administration refused to enforce sanctions against Russia, despite being signed into law. The administration also eased sanctions against Russia in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

Sanctions never really hurt the elites in such nations, who take their cut of the pie before anyone else. No matter how bad it gets in Russia, Putin is still going to have food on the table and a roof over his head. Their major impact is to hurt the middle class and drive them into poverty - and dependence on the regime. Since the power base for authoritarian governments is the dependent underclass, this generally means they sell a narrative of an outside enemy that must be united against and the (now impoverished) people don't have much choice except to follow along.

Sanctions also reduce commerce, meaning that the average citizen has less direct contact with information from the outside world. In most cases, this means they're getting less accurate information and in virtually all cases, it means they're getting information biased against those from the outside world."
548,Why did prominent Democrats such as John Kerry and Ted Kennedy endorse Obama over Clinton in 2008?,"So each politician has their own reasons that we may never know for their endorsements. But we can review the media at the time and make some assumptions and conclusions.

John Kerry ran in 2004 with John Edwards as the VP. So when Kerry endorsed Obama, it was seen as a slap in the face of Edwards, not Clinton. Kerry, at least publicly, seemed to somewhat endorse the ""dark horse"" mentality of Obama's 2008 campaign. He wasn't an entrenched politician and was to the left of Clinton, both things Kerry seemed to hit on at the time.

Ted Kennedy has apparently always favored the younger up-and-comers rather than the status quo presidents (like someone he was related to). Kennedy was also very supportive of Obama backing his failed immigration bill while in the Senate. These two factors influence Kennedy to support Obama over Clinton, with whom he'd made connections with during Bill Clinton's time in office."
549,What would be the pros and cons of replacing the United kingdom's monarchy with a ceremonial presidency?,"The [monarchy](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/has-the-queen-done-a-good-job-during-her-time-on-the-throne) is generally much more popular than [the sitting government](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/government-approval), and retaining the monarchy is [supported across party lines](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/zzfjr9fmfc/Attitudes%20to%20monarchy%202021.pdf). The main drawback, therefore, is taking a portfolio of powers and responsibilities from a fairly trusted and respected institution, and handing it over to a political system that lacks a lot of public trust and confidence.

However, sufficient levels of scandal could change the dynamic; Elizabeth is more popular herself than the monarchy as an abstract proposition. Without that, however, I think cultural inertia will stave off republicanism for quite some time (only the very youngest generation is republican).

As for the exact method, the [Commonwealth of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Britain_Bill) proposal called for a president jointly elected by the House of Commons and a House of Lords reconfigured as a democratic upper house; I think that a joint election is the likely form. The UK manages to elect Speakers of the House (a similarly non-partisan position with some political power); it would not be too difficult a feat to do the same with a President."

552,Russian Invasion Megathread,"Has Russia chosen a very bad time to start the invasion?:

* They could have chosen to attack when the COVID-19 pandemic was crippling Europe, instead of now when Europe is mostly vaccinated."

555,Are there more reasons for a nuclear retaliation than a nuclear attack?,"In a realistic view, not really.

Nuclear weapons and the threat thereof are generally more useful in a negotiation context and to deter attack by conventional forces. As such, it's much better to *have* them and not use them because you can use the *threat* of them over and over again (a la North Korea) but you can't un-detonate a nuclear device.

In a last-ditch defense effort to resist the advance of a conventional military the leadership of a nuclear capable power might consider utilizing nuclear weapons against the invaders, perhaps hoping to damage their forces enough to survive the onslaught or even just as a final middle finger to the invading nation.

Even that is....a stretch. 

The use of nuclear weapons is not something that any nation takes lightly and doing so raises the potential of an in kind response from other nations or from a dramatic shift in opinion about the war itself.

Plus there's just the fact that most people, even leaders, are not sociopathic enough to consider a suicide run with a nuclear weapon worth exploring seriously."

557,How exactly does the oligarchy work in Putin's Russia? Why does he need them to hold onto his money instead of holding the money he laundered himself?,"It's less about holding onto money as it is holding onto power.

The oligarchs are Putin's key supporters, they provide funding and support for him and his government in exchange for favor with Putin. They also control large sections of the Russian economy as well as the media.

Money is part of it but less on the individual level and more on the state level. Putin himself is a very wealthy person in his own right but when you're talking about money on a state level, it's nice to have a bunch of billionaires who support you and can cut you a check in exchange for some cherry opportunities later on.

Individually, the oligarchs aren't as strong but together they represent a significant power base that Putin depends on to stay in power.

Historically, being a warmonger would have been worse. A terrorist just kills a few people, while a warmonger triggers wars that kill millions.

563,Why do we need to expand NATO?,"To force Ukraine to give up the choice of ever joining NATO would violate the sovereignty principle, that a country should be free to manage its own affairs, including what international organizations and military alliances it may join. The sovereignty principle is more important than Putin's anxieties of a possible NATO member on Russia's western border. Sovereignty is such a fundamental pillar of how we define countries that the US, itself a violator of the principle at times, has an obligation to defend it.

I remember watching the news in 2014, when masses of Ukrainians marched in the streets to protest Russian interference in its government and the end of EU membership talks. I remember seeing the parading patriots in the streets when Yanukovych resigned and fled. I see them as a sister people, yearning for freedom and self-determination. Isn't that worth protecting?"

Some of them are just ""for show"" or only hit a few main points, but there are plenty of calls that are more in the weeds. Every single call has dozens of people on both sides, listening, recording, and taking notes. Both leaders work with teams on exactly what they're going to say, and how they'll respond to the other party. 

If they need a translator, they'll use one. Some in person meetings don't have recordings, but almost certainly every phone call does. They're not worried about leaks because the people who have access to recordings are often the most trusted team working directly for the head of state. A lot of calls have official transcripts released."
565,What would happen if a NATO member attacked a different country first?,"No, one of the defining features of NATO is ""[collective defense](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm),"" which is fundamentally different than ""collective offense."" Article 5 of the [North Atlantic Treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17120.htm?) states, ""The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all\[.\]""

NATO members are not required to support the offensive actions of another NATO member. A notable example of this was [France's refusal to invade Iraq](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/france-no-troops-to-iraq/) in 2003."

567,"why where do hand washing regulations not exist, when mask regulations exist in almost all countries?","It’s really easy to enforce and verify compliance with a mask mandate. Are they wearing their mask? Yes? They’re in compliance. 

How would you enforce and verify compliance with a hand washing mandate?"
568,So... did Russia invade Ukraine?,"In the shortest answer to most people, yes. Russia has invaded Ukraine. 

The longer answer to it has a few different angles. 

From Russia's official position, what they have done is recognise independent breakaway states from Ukraine. And now with these independent states, he is moving in 'peacekeeping' forces. So his argument would be, at least officially, would be that he has still not invaded Ukraine - instead two parts of the country have seceded and are independent, and have allowed him to put his troops on the ground as peacekeepers. Thus in his argument, it's not Ukraine and he's not invading. 

For basically everyone else, the territory is officially still Ukraine, and Putin has officially moved his forces across that line - hence an invasion. To them, the land is still Ukraine. And the 'peacekeepers' are still Russian military forces. Thus to them, hard to call it anything else but an invasion. 

The asterisk on has the war officially begun, arguably it began a long time ago but this is a dramatic shift. That asterisk being that there has been armed conflict in the East for quite some time in which officially only Russian 'volunteers' with Russian provided equipment were actively engaged. This was a bit of a flow on what Russia admitted but basically started with no involvement, to Russian volunteers only, to official material support, to wink-nod confession. In that sense, Russia already had troops on Ukrainian soil, but not officially and never to this scale."
569,"Why has the US historically backed democratic movements in Central and Eastern Europe, while backing right-wing dictatorships in South America?","First interesting fact is we have something called the School of the Americas. This says South America but they did also support the East. What I can say is every leader they helped place was later overthrown with our support as they had become despots. In example, Noriega, Pinochet, Quddaffi, Roberto D'Aubuisson to name a few. Democratic is actually the incorrect word. It is Democracy. It has evolved from the cold war actions to bring Democracy to Communist and terror run regimes. 
    The School of the Americas is charged by P.L. 100-180 (10 USC 4415) with the mission of developing and conducting instruction for the armed forces of Latin America, using the most doctrinally sound, relevant, and cost-effective training programs possible.
   Kennedy ordered the school to begin teaching “anti-communist” counterinsurgency. The School of the Americas began training in riot and mob control, special warfare, jungle warfare, intelligence and counterintelligence.
Obviously it has faults lol"

573,Why evacuate the US embassy in Ukraine and not the US embassy in Moscow?,Because Ukraine would be the country getting invaded.  This isn't a diplomatic maneuver like withdrawing the ambassador (at least not entirely.). They're worried the embassy could be obliterated and everyone inside it could be killed.
574,Is there anything Trump could have done in his 4 years as president to have avoided the current situation in Ukraine?,"Probably should not have extorted Ukraine's President into starting a phony investigation of his domestic political opponent by withholding critical military aid.

[Y'all remember that one?](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49800181)

That made the US look exceptionally weak. All the other pandering to Putin was an issue, too, most notably [his siding with Putin over his own intelligence services solely because of his ego.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812) That made the US look so easily manipulated that Putin probably thought disinformation and a little pandering to right-wing US media would let him off the hook for whatever he wanted to do in Ukraine. 

Ultimately, to answer your question more directly, he could have prioritized investments in NATO countries closest to Ukraine, such as Romania and Poland, without alienating the rest of NATO or insulting them by repeatedly threatening to pull out of the alliance. But that would also have required him to prioritize a budget for things like military material assistance to Ukraine, infrastructure investments in NATO allied bases, and bigger rotations into Europe for US Army units. However, his process and budget priorities were too chaotic and prone to personal whims for anything effective to have been done on those fronts during his presidency. Ultimately, all he had to do was be a little less incompetent and corrupt, and Ukraine would be in a better place now than it is."

576,How can any nation sanction any other in the age of cryptocurrency?,"Because cryptocurrency, while not exactly a scam, is much too close to a scam for any nation to rely on it for something like foreign policy.  El Salvador's holdings, by the way, are around 1% of GDP if I remember correctly.  

Reason two is, that's not how sanctions work.  If Russia is sanctioned, the terms of the sanctions might be ""No US government or private entity will buy any oil or gas from Russia."" It doesn't matter if Russia owns every bitcoin ever minted, we're not buying what they're selling."

579,Why is libertarianism not generally called pro-capitalism? Is it just a way of saying you support a more extreme form of free marker capitalism?,"Besides endorsing an extreme form of free market capitalism (very different from what Adam Smith or the vast majority of pro-capitalist economists would endorse) Libertarianism comes out of the Utilitarian Neo-Classical Economic tradition (eg John Stuart Mill.) 

Before Mill, Utilitarians tried to calculate the greatest good for the greatest number using units like Hedons (pleasure) and Dolors (pain, displeasure). But the problem was that those units are so subjective that it’s impossible, or at least wildly impractical, to measure them.

Mills solution was [preference utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism) — instead of maximizing Hedons, you maximize preference — and free markets maximize preference. And you can accurately calculate how to maximize preferences using [indifference curves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indifferencecurve.asp). These insights are what separates neo-classical economics from classical economics.

But anyway, Libertarinism also draws from this tradition. Not only do they see the economy as an engine to maximize preferences, but there’s a ethical aspect as well, where preferences are the only good by which all other goods are measured."
580,Do LibLeft Societies even exist?,"Well I'm not really sure what you mean by liberal left society, but if you mean a more liberal society then America there are lot's of examples.  Canada is an obvious choice in that it's actually abnormal for the Liberal party not to be in power nationally.  There have only been 4 Conservative Party (in it's various forms over time) Majority governments.  All the rest were Liberal majorities, and beyond that so were most of the minority governments too!  Conservatives can win provincial elections, and obviously win in some areas regularly.  But nationally it's a bit like the whole country is like a bigger California."

584,Are Reddit politics accurate?,"No, they're not accurate.  It also depends which particular kind of 'accuracy' you're talking about; as there's a difference between the kind of articles that are posted, what represents the median voter, and what the users say.

In general, reddit leans very strongly left.  It also leans progressive, and has a much younger userbase than the voterbase.  Iirc it also trends whiter and more male, more educated, and more affluent.

Individual subreddits can of course vary wildly.

R politics is generally regarded as being garbage (at least amongst the people I know from several subs).  The articles posted there are generally at least technically correct, but sometimes misleading, and the overall selection of what gets posted is highly biased.  The comment sections are useless and highly biased.

The phenomenon of rage/anger at a group due to media exposure (including social media) is well known.  Fortunately there's also strong evidence that as long as you stick to your plan of discontinuing reading about politics on reddit you'll turn back to normal.

Things are'nt as bad as reddit says, though they are quite serious."
585,Why Can’t The Supreme Court Revert To Archaic of Atavistic Precedents?,"I'm a little confused by what you're asking. Are you asking if there's a legal mechanism in place that in general prevents the court from reversing long standing precedent? Because that's one of those questions that's too broad to be answered. Every case the courts hear has its own relevant source of law, so the answer is inevitably going to be ""it depends."""
586,"Is there truly ""Lawlessness"" occurring in US cities currently?","NYC guy here. Here’s what I consider a very honest answer: it’s a little worse than it used to be, but it’s nowhere near as bad as Fox News and other conservative outlets make it.

The details: homelessness is definitely up, and that’s due to a few factors, but a lot of it is Covid. Shelters and hospitals had to accept fewer people because of spacing issues, and with homelessness being up, there is more public drug use and more public ruination (I’ve seen to twice—I never used to see that). That sort of thing is always in cities—part of the charm of city life—but it is definitely more than usual. 

In terms of safety, most neighborhoods are about the same, but it seems like rougher neighborhoods got a little rougher. My wife and I still bring our kiddo to the park, get on subways, etc. Life as usual. 

What is definitely up, though, is my parents asking me how I can live in a war zone. Their concerns don’t match my reality in any way. I think conservative media outlets try to paint city life as anarchy because cities tend to embrace more liberal policies, which tend to work well in larger cities. 

That’s my take. Other cities may be different, but we have family is SF, and it seems to be the same out there. A little rougher, mostly due to Covid, but not nearly as bad as many outlets say it is."
587,Has this terrible political system ever been attempted?,"Yes. The Romans had three legislative bodies that did not necessarily have to agree with one another to create laws.

The *Assembly of the Centuries* was dominated by wealthy men.

The *Senate* was deminated by wealthy men from aristocratic families who had served public office.

The *Tribal Assembly* was dominated by the common people of Italia.

Generally, the Senate was the most power of these three institutions, having the power to legislative over nearly all matters. There were a few subjects that were reserved to the other bodies, though. For example, Roman Elections were mostly a matter that was dealt with by the *Centuries*, while the *Tribal Assembly* mostly dealt with law related to common people.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, we don't know *exactly* how these branches of the legislative interacted with each other as the texts are lost to time, but we do know that each law did not explictly require permission from every branch.

A good way to imagine this is like how the US Senate can legislate on treaties, without the approval of the House of Representatives."
588,What would happen internally in Russia if Putin pulls back his troops?,">What would happen internally in Russia if Putin pulls back his troops?

Same thing that happened during the 2018 buildup, or the 2021 buildup... nothing. This is by far not the first Russian buildup on Ukraine's border. 

Putin doesn't need to invade to accomplish his goals. All he has to do is do a buildup on Ukraine's borders every few years and that will probably be enough politically to permanently keep Ukraine from joining NATO. 

This is all money well spent in the eyes of Russian authorities."
589,What is the extreme of liberalism?,"I think you might have to redefine your terms.  At the very least, are we talking about the moderate-left political ideology or the liberalism that is neoconservative?"
590,Under what circumstances would the Jan 6 storming of the US capitol have been acceptable?,"Either we are a nation of laws or we aren't, and if we aren't then a Jan 6 type event would be the least of our worries.  We have laws and systems in place to address our grievances with government; there's no clause in the constitution that allows citizens to just overthrow a government they don't like.  Having said that, I'd like to point out that you can dislike the outcome of a political process as much as you want but *disagreeing* with the outcome of a political process is not a legitimate grievance and you (singular) have no \*legal\* recourse other than voting.  If the republicans thought the 2020 election was fraudulent (spoiler - it wasn't, and its a completely disingenuous argument anyway) there are legal channels to investigate processes and results and while they never mentioned that on Fox (*quelle surprise*) those challenges did happen and the results were confirmed multiple times.  Sending a horde of misinformed reactionaries to 'protest' (that term is used generously here) is a terrible idea.    None of the Jan 6 insurrectionists had a clue as to what actually happened, and in this case it is absolutely unacceptable to attack your fellow citizens, destroy public property, or enact violence in order to effect your desired political change.

If Trump had somehow remained in office illegitimately (lol 'green bay sweep') I do not believe the capitol would have been overrun by some imaginary cabal of leftist antifa troublemakers; thats not how the left typically operates.  The far right loves to fantasize about their absurd civil war on the 100% made-up ""DeEp StAtE"" but the 2A types are going to be very unpleasantly surprised when it turns out their gun fetish absolutely does not save them from a supposed tyrannical federal government.  Not only is the right using guns as a wedge issue to stoke the culture war, they are taking your rights away legally using the very political process they love to decry.  If the federal government really was tyrannical, they would have no issues dropping a few dozen drone strikes on any actual insurrectionists, no matter how many AR15s they are clutching.

I encourage all Americans to travel outside of North America.  Not only will you find many, if not all, of the same freedoms enjoyed in the USA - you will see many of the systems that are somehow completely impossible in the US actually working to benefit the citizens of other, non-American countries such as universal healthcare, gun control, affordable housing and college, etc."
591,Why do Republicans believe that the US is a Christian nation and that the separation of church and state doesn't exist?,"What it means to be a ""Christian nation"" is not settled and I think that conservatives who say this probably don't actually agree on it. 

Usually, they argue that the United States was founded by Christians who explicitly drew on Christianity to justify the establishment of the country and constructed the American form of government based on ""Christian values""

That's not total B.S. but it's way more complicated than that. The United States was not created by one totally homogenous group of people. The ""founding fathers"" were hundreds if not 1,000s of people who contributed to the legal foundations of the American government, who all had very different philosophical, religious, and political ideas. Most were Christian but not all, and many were non-conforming Christians who had beliefs few on the contemporary Christian right would recognize. Religion and God-centered philosophies were a big deal for many of these people but not for all, and some explicitly wanted the government to be secular."
592,How does Cuba preserve its regime without having nukes?,"By avoiding conflict and maintaining a local power basis. If Cuba would do what North Korea does in terms of dealing in anything illegal it would be invaded. But by avoiding conflict over these types of things they're quite safe from being invaded. They can't develop nukes however, America would never allow it in their sphere of influence.

Both governments can only negotiate about sanctions if they're willing to give in to demands designed to erode their power base. Both would be way better off if they had nukes, because then they could negotiate about something other than their grip on power. Kim Jong-Un can't afford diplomacy without it because his local power base is completly build around the military and the fear of a foreign invasion, while in Cubas it isn't. That's the reason Kim Jong-Un needs nukes so bad. But he's on thin ice because Russia and China don't necessarily like him becoming too powerful (dangerous)."
593,Would a congressional stock trading ban really make sense?,"The other scenario is when a senator or rep gets wind of a highway project that's coming up and buys property on the outskirts of a town or near a hwy intersection, then either develops it or flips it as comm'l property after the highway gets started. 

Not covered under this ban, and it happens all the time. But hey, baby steps, I guess."
594,Must Trump concede in order to run again in 2024 without contradicting himself?,">Does this statement refer only to winning an election, which Trump believes he did in 2020, or both winning an election and being sworn into office?

It would refer to only ACTUALLY winning an election. The process of the 2020 election happened, and Biden was sworn in. So Trump (by any legal and political definition) was not elected President in 2020. Trump can claim he won all he wants, but if it was litigated his attorneys would almost assuredly agree he WASN'T elected and his statements are more politics.

>If it's the latter, doesn't that mean Trump must concede in order to be eligible for reelection in 2024 according to the 22A?

The 22nd amendment doesn't say he must concede, and he can claim the election was stolen all he wants. We know he wasn't elected, so that's all the amendment cares about."
595,"Why do we keep hearing about how inflation is due to the extra money printed, but much less about pent up demand?","There was more demand partly because people had more money, partly because of pent up demand. Simultaneously there was less supply because of supply chain issues. Also, interest rates were low which disincentivized savings.

We hear more about the money side probably because it’s easier to understand and for political reasons.

You’d get better answers asking on r/askeconomics. Answers on economic questions here tend to be very partisan."
596,"Is the PRC's ""wolf warrior diplomacy"" born out of weakness or out of strength?","Big talk comes from a position of weakness.  They are a legitimate threat, without a doubt; but don't confuse firepower with strength.  Any nation that fears it's own people as much as the CCP seems to isn't operating from a position of strength.  If you're so fragile that you consider mere knowledge of the past an existential threat, then it's hard to imagine your administration surviving a true test."
597,Why is Myanmar is suffering from a food shortage?,"In very very simplified terms, the vast majority of it isn't food shortages exactly but rather a collapsing economy in which a broader band of the population no longer has access to affordable food. 

Food insecurity was already somewhat of an issue as it was in Myanmar, so it's not necessarily as if this came out of nowhere. But with the coup, a lot of industry, manufacturing, and very importantly banking came to a near total halt. A lot of Burmese are unable to access their money and many just don't have any now due to lost wages (either through unemployment from their industries shuttering or otherwise reduced). They're then unable to access food and are cutting back or going hungry. Farms are also struggling with access to capital to keep running, especially on tight harvests.

To lesser but still important, there's also dyamics of reduced foreign investment, contractions on trade (and with even the trade still going on limited by reduced capacity on supply chain process), rising prices of staple goods, etc. 

But the core of it is that the entire economy has been both in freefall and shuttered in large part, sending a larger band of the population into poverty levels that fall below the threshold of being able to afford food."
598,How can we tell if the Armed Forces of Ukraine will crumble in the face of war like the Afghan National Army did?,"The Ukrainian army has been effectively at war with Russia since they began their occupation in 2014.  This has led to a growing Ukrainian nationalism and greater professionalization in their military.  The nationalism factor is a big deal, because the Ukrainians were never a bunch of tribal factions fighting each other like in Afghanistan.  This has been a nation for centuries, and is quite western by comparison to Afghanistan which never really had much civilization."
599,"Why hasn't Russia tried to destabilize/invade the Baltic states after 1991 like it did for Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine?",Because they were in NATO when those things happened.
600,Is media political pressure good?,"It can be, and in the past, it certainly has been. Especially when investigative journalism was more widespread. Watergate was driven entirely by the media. But it's a tool that's been used for both good and bad - Pulitzer and Hearst both developed a reputation for shaping the news to benefit themselves personally.

I personally suspect that the death of investigative journalism is part of why disinformation has become so much more powerful over the past decade, so I would argue that media applying political pressure is still overall a positive force."
601,Do the NRA and Republican Party ever work alongside one another?,"> There are a few instances in which the NRA has utilised its lobbying efforts towards Republican candidates

A few? The NRA [grades](https://www.nrapvf.org/grades/) politicians nation wide and encourages their members to only vote for approved NRA politicians. And you can see for yourself that the vast majority of their chose candidates are Republicans. This isn't exactly a controversial issue."
602,What would happen to global microchip supply if China invaded Taiwan?,"Taiwan absolutely would go scorched earth for microchip production, not allowing China to produce chips. There are already rumors of major plants being rigged to blow important components.

On the eve of an invasion Taiwan would basically remind the world they can either defend them or have massive microchips shortages for at least 5 years while domestic plants are brought online. As a bonus, China wouldn’t be able to produce as much electronics and thus would have a massive GDP decline even without boycotts/sanctions."
603,Is N. Korea and Cuba bad publicity for communism via the view point of China/Vietnam or the existence of more communist nations despite their bad reputations are more important to them?,"I am not sure there’s any charitable view of China and Vietnam’s governments that would describe them accurately as ‘communist.’ Both countries maintain certain institutions from their revolutionary origin but China is one of the most aggressively capitalist, perhaps mercantilist, countries on the planet and Vietnam’s VCP is a de facto oligarchy at this point. They don’t criticize Cuba and NKorea on Communist grounds because they don’t care and typically maintain a ‘we have our own interpretation of what that word means, other countries have theirs, it’s all cool.’"
604,"Is it true that continuing relations with Saudi Arabia, despite its poor human rights records, is partly attributed to the kingdom's recent liberalisation? Is continuing relations better than sanctions?","As I understand it, the US-Saudi relationship has more to do with Israel. US also overlooks human rights violations in China because their are other priorities that need to be taken into consideration, such as containment of North Korea."
605,What is the difference between a full term and an unexpired term?,"Full Term is when someone serves for the entirety of their term (six years in the senate, 4 years white house etc). An unexpired term is when someone vacates a seat before their term is up, and the seat is filled by someone until that first person's term would have been over (So Senator X serves for four years and is replaced with Senator Y who serves the remaining 2)"
606,What would be NATO's response if Russia invades a NATO member that borders the Black Sea?,"Depends on the circumstance but invading Bulgaria or attacking Bulgaria’s military would trigger Article 5 and require NATO to defend it. Bulgaria would have to decline to cite Article 5 for anything else to happen. Practically speaking even if some NATO members (Germany) are lukewarm about defending Eastern European members others are not out of necessity due to their proximity (Turkey, Romania, North Macedonia)"
607,"Since it's usually held that the rural-urban divide aligns with the conservative-liberal divide in American politics, what accounts for rural areas in the New England states that vote predominantly for Democrats?","Most of those places you're imagining as 'rural' aren't very rural. For example, Massachusetts has no unincorporated land - every scrap of land within the state is incorporated into some city or township.

Upstate Maine would legitimately count as rural, but it also leans heavily Republican."
608,Why is nationalism so frowned upon in Africa when the very countries that exist now are overwhelmingly puppet states carved out by Western countries to more easily extract resources?,Somewhat confused by the premise. I have an answer but first; Do you have a source describing someone doing what you’re talking about? What event or statement sparked the question?
609,Was there a time in US history where debating policy in presidential primaries made sense?,"This is one of the chief arguments AGAINST primaries, actually. There's a reason other democracies don't use them like we have in the US. I've said it time and time again: primaries are NOT for the general population. They are matters of internal governance for committed members of that given party for just this reason. Primaries are a reasonably decent mechanic when they are seen from the right perspective. When they become a national discussion throughout the entire electorate, then primaries are actually detrimental to the process."

612,Could partyless elections help reduce polarisation? Especially if laws are created to prohibit special interest groups from endorsing any particular candidate?,"I'll pose the counter-question of how you'd realistically prevent groups of people from endorsing candidates.  Even accepting your hypothetical of a country where you could ban a group from doing so, how could you prevent something like the leader of that group saying, ""hey, in my personal capacity, I just think Congressman ____ seems like she really supports a lot of the causes I do,"" which then is basically a wink-wink nod-nod endorsement.  At some point, you'd have to ban individual people from endorsing political figures, which even if legal, is either a totalitarian state or going to be totally ineffective."
613,Why do countries hold military exercises in extremely provocative places?,"Because it is an exercise in case of military action there. An exercise isn’t just running around the woods, it’s going to involve the huge amounts of logistics involved in preparing for military operations in that area. It’s a lot easier to do warfare if you are already used to how all the trains, ports, and roads work in the area you’re going to be operating in. 

As far as the international relations goes, it says exactly that: we aren’t launching anything right now, but we are loudly demonstrating that if a military campaign were to happen here, we are preparing for it. It’s not really a “lie” at all."
614,Nebraska is the only state in the US with a nonpartisan legislature. Has this had any meaningful impact on Nebraskan politics? Is Nebraskan politics unique in any way because of this?,"The legislature is also unique in that it is the only state legislature with one chamber. Nebraska does not have a house or a senate (though, the members are referred to as senators). It’s commonly referred to as the state unicameral. 

The division still exists. It’s evident that senators such as Blood, Morfeld, Hunt, Wayne, etc. are democrats while senators such as Slama, Linehan, Hilgers, etc. are Republican. See also [Ballotpedia Breakdown](https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_State_Senate_(unicameral))

The Republican faction however also is broken at times between the more moderate wing and the far-right wing. Remember, the vast majority of the unicameral is GOP-affiliated. I will note that this set up does prevent *some* (albeit, not a lot and minimal) partisanship. Recently, for example, Wayne (D-North Omaha) and his neighbor to the east, McKinney (D-North Omaha), were on the side of advocating for school choice (they represent a majority extremely low-income, African American majority constituency) along with many right-wing state politicians.


As an aside, the state court system is also set up in a way to prevent partisanship."
615,If a Civilian of one Country Assassinated a Person of High Political Power in Another Country Like A President or Priminister Would It Automatically Start a War?,"It really depends on the context. Are the two countries already so hostile that they just needed something to push it over the edge?  Is the country of the assassinated leader militaristic or colonial, is it looking for a pretext to start an invasion? Then it would probably start a war.

If the two countries are allies or even neutral, then it probably would not."
616,How has Botswana stayed a democracy?,"The big issue with most theories on how states will act in comparative politics is that they always have exceptions - that's not to discredit them - but people and thus countries are always a little more complex. We use them to help explain phenomena but we can't use them as a rule.

On Botswana, in very short terms, there are two elements to the question - both related and tied to each other but technically different. Botswana has been comparatively stable among other post-colonial independent, resource rich and focused states in the region. It is also a democracy, though a flawed one (flawed not being a negative critique, you could also call it limited - but effectively it is not competitive. The same way Singapore is often called the world's most successful non-democracy - it's a democracy but not a competitive one).

On history, stability, and democracy, good to start with that point. Botswana is stable and yes, is a democracy, but one in which the ruling party has never lost the leadership of the country since independence. The Botswana Democratic Party has always held the Presidency, and has always held it for long successive administrations (10+ years each), each serving as the Vice President to the President preceding them, making only 5 since independence in the 60s.  I'll come back to the impact of that in other ways but that is a very stable way to run things - arguments aside on how it happens - that has meant a relatively unchallenged reign on authority in the country from a unified party with a clear line of designated succession (in that sense,  though yes elected, it's not a competitive democracy with reasonably competitive factions).

Those leaders have each identified, 'trained', and successfully handed over power to their successors after long reigns. In theory, this then is the same theory of stability as monarchies - there's a stability in having longer term leaders who are preparing known candidates to replace them, who will then do the same. In that way, they are almost in themselves, a chosen dynasty. And on the subject of monarchy, the first in that line of succession was President Sertsei Khama, who first led the independence push for Botswana from the British. He was the grandson of King Khama III (and himself kgosi - or king), which ties into again, the stability of transition in power from prior systems (the monarchy, and the monarchy as it existed under Empire) into democracy in independence. (Seretse Khama's son, Ian Khama, the great-grandson of King Khama III was also one of the 5 presidents so far). Unlike many newly independent former-colonies, it wasn't a revolutionary restart of governance as much as it was a transition in line with what they had known. It leveraged pre-existing systems of government into the new.

This was made even easier by the relatively homogenous ethnic composition of Botswana. While most former colonies in Africa were Europeans drawing lines that ignored existing tribes, governments, and communities, Botswana (though not perfect and a history into itself) was largely homogenous ethnic Tswana - so again, unlike many others - they weren't facing as much of an internal divide on ethnic lines. Where one did exist - with white descendants of settlers in Botswana, they handled differently. Despite a relatively minor part of the country (I think sub-5%) they, like most colonial settlers, held an outsized share of the wealth and resources.

On the resource intensive end, they controlled that through again, a 'glide path'. Unlike other efforts to immediate nationalise natural resources or land by force, or worse, allow them to be taken over by independent parties, the government at start moved to buy out the diamond industry control - that sounds minor but it avoided much backlash from those external parties with interest in it and avoided any major disruption in which thrid parties felt like they had a shot at controlling it. The share of control on that industry was always firmly in the hands of a foreign corporation or the government, with no in-between. It also made clear to that white minority that they weren't facing a government that would forcibly seize their assets - and thus, presenting less antagonism between an ethnic minority with resources and the governing body.

Also a bit of a tangent anecdote but important - Seretse Khama quite scandalously for the British, South Africans, and even Seretse's own uncle who was then the regent for Seretse as kgosi, married a white British woman. The South Africans were strongly enforcing (and defending) an apartheid regime and the British (for many reasons) also found scandal in it. And as the wife of the kgosi, Seretse's wife was meant to be the mother and queen of their tribe, which his uncle saw as impossible with a white woman. But she famously embraced their tradition (and lucked out with her arrival coming at the start of a hugely beneficial rainy period), was welcomed by the people and embraced, doubled down by the fact that so many external parties opposed it. But more to the point, it was seen as a union in that even already managed ethnic division with the white minority in Botswana - and did quite a bit to focus even that already ethnically homogenous population to identify collectively under the banner of their country rather than ethnicity - in essence, it was basically a marriage of union (even though one not politically founded to do so).

All that to say, they had a 'glide path' to new governance rather than the vacuum that many other newly-independent former colonies in the region did. And where potential vacuums or areas for revolutionary zeal could arise (power vacuums from unclear succession, competing ethnic divides, opportunity for takeover on resources). One more element was precedence setting on the role of military intervention. Without precedence of civil war or need to take independence by force, the precedence for military control on civilian government didn't exist. And the leaders it had took steps to avoid it developing - partially through that clear line of succession in which military control played no part, and in its leaders delineating the line between them (Ian Khama held rank as general before his administration, and loudly stepped down from that military role before taking up his civilian leadership in government).

All that said and done, stability tends to breed stability. A stable government, especially one with that clear a line of succession with long-terms and of the same party and agenda, means they have the space to invest more in infrastructure, support for the population, and public programmes (especially with stable funding from natural resources clearly under their control), rather than losing money to fighting off tensions and challenges from minor parties (a very different but similar way in which China is able to invest in these huge multi-trillion dollar public infrastructure projects because they can safely plan for 20-30 year projects without fear they'll need to fight for funding or approval). That stability not just politically but on implementation means even less of a vacuum for challenging factions. To paraphrase Legally Blonde, stability leads to better delivery for the public, and better delivery for the public leads to a happier population. And happy people don't just go kill people (or revolt or stage a coup).

That all being said, it's a relatively short history. Stability breeds stability but instability also breeds instability. It has worked up until this point but things can and do fall apart. Unemployment is still high and the HIV/AIDS crisis is no joke. Surrounding instability, especially for an export focused landlocked country, can very quickly spell disaster for such a single-industry focused country. Again very different example but if you look at Venezuela, oil funded government programmes made for a relatively stable (though distinctly not democratic) governance for some time, until it fell apart and all hell broke loose. The country has been remarkably stable but we're looking here at a relatively short history of just over 50 years of independence. They've benefitted from a stable stream of strong and effective leaders who made good choices (for stability) but it also really only  takes one really bad crisis or one bad leader to ruin things.

That being said, the model has takeaways. I think a lot of the effort in Rwanda since the genocide there in the 90s has taken a similar stream of emphasising a national identity to occupy the space of ethnic tensions that existed before, maintaining a very strong (where some would also argue is a limited though 'benevolent' democracy with clear control from one leader) that is emphasising and banking on huge investment in public infrastructure to continue feeding that stability.

tl;dr: Botswana is very stable, only kinda a democracy - and it didn't create its democracy out of thin air, but really just  transitioned its traditional tribal monarchy to meet a democratic system - but it made good decisions to ensure stability and set good precedents for future stability - but has also been quite lucky."
617,Can political party’s run in multiple countries?,"It depends on the laws of each particular country but theoretically yes. 

This is often the case of parties that represent nationalities or ethnic groups that have large Diasporas or no one nation-state of their own. 

Examples include Sinn Fein, (as mentioned), The Worker's Party, People Before Profit, and The Green party  in the UK and RoI, and the Armenian Revolutionary Party and the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party in Armenia and Lebanon, 

This is not the same thing as ""running in multiple countries"" but many parties are members of political internationals, alliances of like-minded but fully autonomous parties around the world. In the U.S. the Republicans are members of the International Democratic Union as are the UK's Conservatives. In Britain, Labour is a member of the Progressive Alliance, the Liberal Democrats of Liberal International. 

Parties in E.U Members states also join together to form Europarties, which compete in elections for the transnational European parliament."

619,[US] Should we return to aingle-issue bills?,"Yes, but to do that you first need to get rid of the filibuster (or dramatically change it). It's the #1 reason why these huge omnibus bills are the norm now.

Virtually every bill which addresses an actual issue gets filibustered as a matter of process now, which makes it require 60 votes to pass. Since politics are so polarized and the Senate is so closely split, getting 60 votes on anything means getting at least 20% of the opposing party to vote for your bill, which isn't going to happen. So the only bills that have any chance of getting passed fall into one of two categories: reconciliation bills which can bypass the filibuster, or bills that address such direly important crises that NOT passing something would make the situation a lot worse very very soon.

The first category, Reconciliation Bills, only comes up a limited number of times. Depending on the ruling of the Senate Parliamentarian the majority party can only pass 1-3 Reconciliation Bills per term (2 year period). So they only get *maybe* 3 bills to pass without worrying about the filibuster, so they try to cram as much into those 3 bills as they can becasue they know that if something doesn't make it into a reconciliation bill it isn't going to pass. Even then, they need to get 50 members of their party to vote for the Reconciliation Bill, so when the Senate is evenly divided as it is now it's even difficult to get 50 members of the same party to agree. Biden's Build Back Better bill that's currently stalled in Congress is an example of a Reconciliation bill.

The other category is when an urgent emergency comes up which requires legislation to be passed NOW or the emergency will get worse. Examples of this include federal funding running out (when there's a risk of a government shutdown) and an appropriations bill needs to be passed, or when the Debt Limit needs to be raised, or when there's a natural disaster like a hurricane or pandemic or something and they need to pass relief funding, or if there's a big recession and the economy needs to be bailed out. In situations like these EVERYONE from both parties agree that *something* needs to be passed to address the crisis. The minority party can't score points from their base by being obstructionist, so they HAVE to come together with the majority to pass a bill or they'll suffer electorally. Since both sides know these bills HAVE to pass they both use it as an opportunity to cram in as much unrelated stuff as they can get away with, hoping that the other side wanting to pass relief for the crisis will make them willing to accept something else they don't want.

Get rid of the filibuster and you'll start to see a LOT more small, single issue bills. But until the filibuster goes away big omnibus bill are all we'll get."
620,Can a sovereign nation join or integrate voluntarily with another sovereign nation?,"The meaning of the word ""sovereign"" when we refer to countries is that there is no higher authority, they get to make up whatever rules they want for themselves.

So if two countries want to merge, they absolutely can. If the two countries both decided to swap their entire populations and go live in the others' houses for the next decade, they could do that too.

However, it is extraordinarily rare that countries actually want to combine together.

The outstanding question in your hypothetical scenario is whether *both* nations are on board."
621,Can the interests of future generations be adequately represented in the political system?,"For the most part, no. There is no institutional protection for future generations.

The only thing that protects them is our care for them.

For example, parents may be inclined to vote in the interests of their children."
622,Can a political campaign hire foreign nationals?,"They can. There's some extra hoops to jump through in terms of reporting but it can happen.

They'd need to meet all of the normal US based hiring restrictions of course. 

If you want to get strict about compliance they can never be allowed to buy/donate anything that is used on the campaign because that would constitute an in-kind contribution."
623,Are there nations with presidents (or other head of state) with indefinite term lengths and yet recallable?,"There used to be some systems that were sort of like this. Westminster Parliaments, for example, would maintain the current government as long as it held a popular mandate as demonstrated by passing its top agenda items, and elections would only be triggered if one of those votes failed or if the PM/monarch called for a new election. However, most of those systems now require a vote every so often regardless, such as the UK that now can't go more than 5 years without an election. 

Democracies are just mostly moving away from those kinds of situations as we have realized more and more that regular elections are essential for a healthy democracy."
624,"The only US Presidential elections to have under 50% voter turnout are in 1920, 1924 & 1996. Why is that?","1920 and 1924 in particular were due to women having just been granted the right to vote, with interest in voting lagging. The article you link touches on this:

>For example, a 1924 study of voter turnout in Chicago found that ""female Chicagoans were far less likely to have visited the polls on Election Day than were men in both the 1920 presidential election (46% vs. 75%) and the 1923 mayoral contest (35% vs. 63%).

If you look at the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#/media/File:US_Vote_for_President_as_Share_of_Population.png) in that article of turnout as a share of total population, you'll see that 1920 and 1924 both actually had all-time high turnouts by that measure compared to previous elections (with 1912 being a local minimum)."
625,How come the US is unable to make the Middle East democratic by force?,"This is actually a really great question that has some pretty in depth discussion. You should read Rajiv Chandrasekaran's *Life in the Emerald City* because it looks at this exact question through the lens of Iraq. 

But before we dive into specifics, it's important to note that West Germany and Japan weren't exactly ""by force."" In both of these cases, the government that the US went to war with completely collapsed. When the US was making democracy, it wasn't actually imposing a system on these countries by force, but rather the folks who were opposing the US had already lost and were outside of any formal power structures in society, replaced by folks who were pro-democracy. Democracy cannot be imposed by force--it requires legitimacy from the people being governed in order to maintain stability. No one has successfully imposed democracy by force on anyone.

Additionally, there were very specific policy decisions made in Germany and Japan that enabled the US to be successful. They prioritized getting society running again as quickly as possible. This makes a big difference. To illustrate this, let's revisit Iraq. Chandrasekaran makes the argument that the US won the war but lost the occupation and that the US had a chance to bring democracy for real if had made better policy choices. Specifically, he points out three major mistakes that the US didn't have to make (and in fact did not make in Germany and Japan).

First, the US simply did not plan for the logistical needs of the occupation. Despite being warned that Hussein's regime's collapse would likely cause total anarchy, Bush ordered as few troops as possible into the country and focused them on areas of high priority to US economic and military interest, not to areas of high priority to Iraqi society. The result was the widespread looting that occurred after the US won the war easily stripped away many of the key institutions Iraq needed to recover. Part of this was dealing cultural blows--museums were destroyed, dulling the sense of civic engagement that is essential to any nation seeking to rebuild. But even more essential, hospitals were emptied of any useful equipment or medicine. Schools were just empty classrooms devoid of even desks, let alone books or other learning tools. When the US won in Germany and Japan, the army rushed in and fully occupied the country well in excess of the minimum troop requirement to secure order, ensuring that the brief period of anarchy attached to any regime collapse didn't hamper the country's ability to recover.

Second, the US made the decision to disband the entirety of the Iraqi army. The rationale here was that the army had been Hussein's primary tool of enforcing his repression and Hussein's tools of repression needed to be disbanded. While this sounds good at first blush, the US did not disband the army of either Germany or Japan despite them having this same problem. It was ultimately a very poor policy because Iraq, Germany, and Japan all had devastated economies at the end of their wars, which included jobs being scarce. Disbanding the army only added to the ranks of the unemployed, but now you included military folks in that number. It shouldn't take much to consider the problems attached to that.

Third, the US took a very aggressive stance to de-Ba'ath Iraq. Again, on the one hand it makes sense to purge the political loyalists to Hussein, but what Bush's team did went far beyond that. Anyone who was registered member of the party became unemployed...but because Hussein required any and all public servants to join the party, this meant that your entire civil architecture disappeared overnight. Not only did this add to the unemployment problem, but it also took away the people most experienced in some form of running a functional government. Once again, in Germany and Japan the US considered doing this but ultimately just went after the folks at the very top of the party structure, recognizing that a most schoolteachers just signed that piece of paper because it's what they needed to do to work, not because they were actually active Hussein supporters.

So as you can see, the reason that democracy in Iraq failed wasn't because it was incompatible, it was because the US did a crap job of making the right decisions to allow it to flourish. This is especially a shame because Bush had advisors in the State Department pushing to make the decisions consistent with lessons learned in Germany and Japan, but he chose to run with the Defense Department's plan every time. Had we made different choices, there is a real chance that Iraq would be a democratic ally of the United States today. 

The only other state in the Middle East that's seen enough of a total governmental collapse and US occupation to even have a chance at instilling democracy is Afghanistan. But Afghanistan had some unique challenges.

First, the US didn't REALLY ever completely conquer Afghanistan nor was it ever a total collapse. Sure, the US was able to render the Taliban basically toothless...but at not point did the Taliban ever abandon their claim to be the government of Afghanistan. That means the US literally was trying to instill democracy by force and as we've already discussed, that doesn't work.

Second, Afghanistan is a uniquely fractured country. It is incredibly tribal even to this day and there isn't much of a national identity to unify Afghans under one national identity. That's a very difficult place to start with when trying to establish a democracy. Given that some parts of Afghanistan are basically ""unconquerable"" because of its natural geography, this makes it nearly impossible to get spirit of cooperation necessary in all party to establish a democracy.

A lot of modern history books on the Iraq war will discuss this idea that winning the war in Iraq was the easy part and that the US COULD have won the occupation with different choices. Chandrasekaran's is a good start, but looking at others will get you a lot of the same theme. I'd highly recommend picking up a book on this subject if you really want to deeply explore this question."

631,What are the foundational arguments against decoupling?,"To put my cards on the table, I'm in favor of whatever policy gets us to 100% renewables in the states the fastest, while respecting the rights we currently have. 

I'm not tied to either idealogy but I believe the argument against de-coupling is that it's based around incrementalism. If you want proof of this, consider the below chart:

[https://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GSR2021\_16t9\_Figure\_2.png](https://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GSR2021_16t9_Figure_2.png)

I think the argument isn't a technological one. If the problem was one that had a 100 year timerame, then incrementalism would make sense. The analogy I use is that of tarmac at an airport: if you have a football field worth of runway, you have the luxury of ramping up slowly. If you have fifty yards, you have less. Scientists can debate about how much we have, but it's probably less than 20 yards."
632,What does the question of voter ID mean in US Politics?,"First. the US does not have a nation ID card.  It's been proposed many times most recently in 2005 with luke warm results and eventual opposition from both sides.  It's being proposed again and we will see.  I wouldn't put money on it.  But generally the Democrat leaning voters have light support for it and the Republicans have light opposition.

Second, we have no unified nation voting process.  Each state makes their own.  This means basic questions like where do you vote?  How long are polls open?  What information do you need to vote?  Do you need to register in advance?  etc are questions with (over) 50 answers.

The problem when talking about voter ID as pushed in Republican states is they often very transparently try to favor their side.  The first problem is the main identification allowed in the US is the driver license.  Many city dwellers do not have a driver's license which favors Republicans.  Additionally, they often add say a gun license, but don't allow a student ID.  This again favors Republicans.  Democrats will often say this disenfranchises minority voters because the law has better protections for not disenfranchising minority races, but has no protections for disenfranchising young adults or the homeless.

I would add that often the voter ID laws used by Republican's often have other non-ID parts that are also designed to make it harder for some people to vote (that just so happens to benefit Republicans).  Changes like requiring advanced registration far in advance, closing polling places in cities so lines are longer, reducing hours of the DMV in the time leading up to an election to make it harder to get a ID, etc."

634,What do people mean the party in power does bad in midterms?,"This is largely considered a ""Modern Era"" rule in politics, so we are really talking about from Harry S. Truman onward.

So yes, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives ""Nearly"" uninterrupted from 1930 to 1994.  But the first of those interruptions was Truman's first Midterm in 1946.  Democrats regained control in 1948 when Truman was re-elected, but then lost 27 seats to Republicans again in 1950.  
  
The next midterm with a Democratic President was 1966 under Lyndon Johnson.  This time Democrats lost 48 seats going from a majority of 295 to 140 down to 247 to 187, but still maintaining control.  
  
And the last midterm with a Democratic President before 1994 was Carter's midterm in 1978, Democrats lost 15 seats in that one.   
  
The biggest loss was Bill Clinton's first midterm where Democrats lost control of the house by losing 58 seats and haven't really recovered since."

But as an aside, I think this is actually a really good example of the problem with term limits. Obama was a popular president. And yet he was prohibited from running, so the party that by most accounts was doing a pretty good job was forced to run someone other than their best candidate, but because everyone's standards for the Dems were based around Obama and they weren't ready to move on from him, Clinton suffered from not being Obama syndrome and Trump won.

>The population is turning more diverse, which usually favors the democrats.

It is also a great tool for radicalizing the majority and base of the Republican Party. So in the short term at least, the increase in diversity is radicalizing the Republicans to turn out.

>Trump is/was very unpopular with moderate voters and still has lots of influence, which should be turning moderate voters away from the GOP.

Voters have a short memory, and the fact that Trump is no longer on Twitter and the media no longer reports on him that often has pushed him out of many people's minds, and politicians generally see improving favorability once they leave office. This might shift if/when Trump actually runs again in 2024, but his influence is not being pushed on most people, so they don't see Trump anymore.

>So, why? If so many things go in the favor of Democrats, why don't they see this translated into (bigger) election victories?

Republicans (both politicians and right-wing media) are very effective at messaging, and people generally blame whoever is in charge for the current problems. The botched Afghanistan withdrawal (at least from a public image perspective), lack of immigration reform, inflation, the constant resurgence of the coronavirus alongside defeatist messaging from the White House on the coronavirus, Biden obviously not being as mentally fit as he has been in the past, etc. Presidents and their party generally lose in the midterms, so it isn't surprising to see Democrats expected to lose ground in 2022."
638,Why was neoconservativism rebranded to neoliberalism?,"It didn't.  I think you might be misunderstanding what Neoconservativism is as it doesn't refer to an era nor are any of the people mentioned actually neoconservative.  It never changed to neoliberalism which is a different thing altogether and normally refers to economic policies, while neoconservative is based around foreign policy.

Neoconservatives are a specific faction within the Republican Party who originally consist of former Democrats who left the party after Henry Jackson failed to win the Democratic primary in 1976 (thus the name neoconservatives or ""new conservatives).  To keep it relatively simple, neoconservatives believe that the USA is good of force in the world and thus it is the responsibility of the USA to spread American values globally, even by force.  Paul Wolfowitz, Paul Bremer, Richard Perle, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Elliott Abrams are all notable neoconservatives.  They had influence within the Reagan administration had a lot of influence during the first half of the Bush II administration before the Iraq debacle sorta tarnished their image but they are still around and have influence on notable GOP figures.

My guess the confusion stems from the fact that ""neocon"" was a common pejorative for any politician that was viewed as a hawk but in recent years ""neoliberal"" has become more popular as a pejorative online, since Neoconservatives haven't really been in any power since 2006."

644,At what point do Covid deaths alter political lean?,"NPR did a good article on this recently.  
[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/05/1059828993/data-vaccine-misinformation-trump-counties-covid-death-rate](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/05/1059828993/data-vaccine-misinformation-trump-counties-covid-death-rate)  


But it doesn't draw any strong conclusions, because partisan affiliation is obviously not something the CDC would track. The closest they can get(the methodology in the link above) is partisan lean of a region and death/hospitalization/vaccination rates of that region. In that context, the greatest predictor of vaccination status(which is also the greatest predictor of being likely to die of covid) is party affiliation.   


That said, there are only two states that have had more covid deaths than the difference between voters in the 2020 election(and these numbers include deaths all time, not just post election), they are:  


Georgia (Dem+12k) Covid deaths: 30k  
Arizona (Dem+10k) Covid deaths: 25k  


Unknown is how much a death or hospitalization would have a splash effect. In other words, would someone who survived hospitalization vote differently, or would survivors of a covid victim change their vote? Also unknown are the amount of deaths above average because covid floods the health system.   


It's pretty safe to say that covid deaths already cut at the margins of the GOP base, but it would be a minor factor-probably less of an electoral factor than doing a 180 and taking on a strong push to get vaccinated, wear masks and other best practices, which would serve to disillusion their base and open them up to be primaried."

647,Would a law prohibiting a specific individual from entering a country constitute a bill of attainder under any country’s law?,"Bills of Attainder are primarily related to English legal tradition. For nations whose legal system doesn't derive from England, prohibitions on Bills of Attainder wouldn't be relevant.

In the specific case you're mentioning - entry into a nation - they also wouldn't be relevant because the legislature wouldn't bother. They'd just call up the equivalent of the INS and ask them not to let the person in. You don't have a 'right' to travel to a nation if you're not a citizen and a nation doesn't need any particular reason to keep you out."

652,Why did do few state governors run for president?,"I'm surprised no one thought of the most obvious answer as to why there are so many more senator than governor candidates.

654,What obligations do US states have in forming governments?,"The Constitution is largely silent on what form state governments have to take. Article 4, section 4 of the Constitution merely provides that 
>""The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government...""

There's some other important restrictions placed in the Constitution. Article 1, section 10 prohibits the states from granting titles of nobility, the 13th amendment prohibits them from establishing slavery, the 15th amendment, 19th amendment, and 26th amendment prohibit voting discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and age. But even within these parameters the Constitution leaves an enormous amount of room for the states to organize themselves as they see fit."
655,Has there been any evidence of corruption of the Supreme Court?,"> Have there been any circumstances in history in which there has been corruption?

Sure. One of the most glaring examples was Abe Fortas, who had various scandals but [ultimately resigned after it was made public that he'd accepted a secret retainer from a friend/Wall Street financier under dubious circumstances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Fortas#Ethics_scandal_and_resignation). If he hadn't resigned, he likely would have been impeached.

The higher approval rating for the Supreme Court mostly just equates to the fact that people expect the Supreme Court to be reactive (all they have to do is rule on laws), while they expect the president and Congress to be proactive (they need to pass laws). One of these bars is much easier to meet than the other."

658,How did Malta end up with some of the most progressive LGBT legislation in the world and simultaneously the most conservative Abortion legislation in the world?,"Sometimes political spectra are weird, man. That's really the short answer. Things that are connected together in one system may not necessarily be in another system, or they may even decouple or entangle over time. 

Back in the day, for example, in American politics evangelicals were strongly divided into two camps: one advocated for a small government while the other was felt government should be an instrument for moral reform of society. It's really strange to consider that this used to be a dividing line between opposing factions because today in American political evangelical circles, they are staunchly for BOTH these things. 

I don't know that there's a truly definitive cause for why these things are somewhat decoupled in this particular political system when they aren't in many others. Sometimes things just go a certain way because that's how they went."

The United States has had a RPR in about the same range for a hundred years. What might be confusing you is the notion of 'proven reserves'. As technology gets better or the price of oil rises, more oil becomes 'proven' because it becomes more practical to extract it."

665,How could I get involved politically?,"*At 14 through HS I would start working on your knowledge base.*

1. Start educating yourself about the election process and how representatives gain office from local/municipal, state to federal.
2. Start educating yourself on the different departments within those governing bodies operate - how they are funded (self generated, taxes, grants, etc.), who is the director and the chains of command.
3. Start educating yourself on the issues - both side of the arguments and what may be causing those issues and challenge your own assumptions. 
4. Start talking to your peers about the issues and gain an understanding of their positions.
5. Do not antagonize your peers on these issues. At those ages, even though you may think so, you or they do not have a firm grasp or well rounded view of all the issues. Plus, HS is hard enough socially so don't ostracize yourself.

*After HS focus on growing your knowledge and continuing to challenge yourself and grow.*

1. Get a job and enter the workforce and learn about people and their motivations.
2. If going to college, join clubs and civilly debate others on issues, perhaps learning to argue both sides of the issues.
3. Your 18 now, so go vote and maybe work as a volunteer on campaigns in local/municipal, state and federal elections.
4. After college or near the end, narrow down your key issues and start volunteering at organizations with the same goals."
666,Why are Americans wanting critical race theory to be taught in schools?,"It's not that people on the left want Critical Race Theory taught in grade school.

It's that what is actually being labeled as CRT, isn't. CRT is being used as a blanket term to attack any education about history that focuses on race. And bans on CRT end up having a chilling effect on teachers who are intimidated to maybe just not touch on race at all in fear that their lessons may receive the CRT label from critics.

As an example, usually anti-CRT laws state that schools cannot teach that one race is superior to another or is inherently racist. Which sounds fine, except that the 1619 Project doesn't do that and is universally lumped into the type of concepts critics of CRT want banned."
667,How has COVID deaths affected Ds vs Rs? Are there regions with likely dramatic voting shifts due to COVID deaths it has it hit both sides fairly equally?,"So it should be noted early on, many Democratic locations were hit harder due to higher population densities. Since the vaccine came out, Trump voting counties have significantly higher COVID death rates than Biden voting counties. 

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/05/1059828993/data-vaccine-misinformation-trump-counties-covid-death-rate

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/17/counties-voted-trump-higher-covid-death-rate

So knowing Trump counties have a higher death rate, and COVID kills the elderly at a significantly higher rate (and the elderly happen to be have a high proportion of Republicans), we can roughly all agree that COVID is killing Republicans at a higher rate than Democrats now.

Is this enough to shift the balance of an election? Probably not. COVID deaths are still relatively small compared to the overall voting population and even if all the deaths are in one party, would only shift very close elections."
668,"In your opinion, why is Japan so socially conservative despite being one of the most developed, educated, urbanized, and democratic societies on Earth?",">- LGBT Movement is also practically non-existent; while homosexuality is pretty tolerated and most don't have an issue with gay sex between partners, gay marriage is out of the question, to say nothing of transgender rights and issues.

This is actually a bit outdated.  LGBT rights have actually become a big issue and recently it was ruled that gay marriage bans are unconstitutional, leading to a flood of expansion LGBT rights in  a lot of local districts.  The current climate is pointing to gay marriage probably becoming legal as numerous politicians and parties have openly supported and there isn't really a strong anti-LGBT movement in Japan for the most part.  

And honestly the main reason why Japan is conservative in some areas compared to similar western countries is probably best explained that Japan isn't a ""western"" country but an Asian country.  The culture and history is extremely different and thus certain issues manifest differently.  If you compare Japan to other Asian countries, they are generally notably one of the more ""liberal"" countries in Asia really only being surpassed by Taiwan.  I'd also argue Japan's ""conservatism"" is overstated on the internet but that is a whole other topic."

671,Is there a way to balance conservatives and proggresives and still not get more and more divided?,"To stop the division, make the division greater. 

Right now we have such a powerful federal government that deep splits inevitably lead to conflict- there's only one prize, the federal one, and everyone fights for it. It's like having only one pizza and trying to please a vegetarian and a meat lover. 

If you devolved more social policymaking to the states instead, you'd get less of this. State governments would be very responsive to the will of their voters, and if you didn't like your local state government moving states is far simpler than changing countries. 

The downside of this is that people would have to give up on having a say in the local politics of the other states- if Texas bans abortion and Oregon supports it at public expense, then the citizens of Texas and Oregon would have to say ""Well, that's their business"" and let it be."
672,"Seeing as how covid has disproportionately killed more GOP voters than Dem voters, is it possible there will be districts that switch over in either direction due covid deaths?","First, you're expressing this in a popular - but somewhat inaccurate - way. COVID has disproportionately killed more *old* voters than young voters. It just so happens that old voters tend to skew more towards the Republican Party.

Second, the total number of COVID deaths is not particular high. Not in the sense of 'altering the electorate' high.

Third, those people were likely going to die from something anyway. You have to look at it from the perspective of years-of-life-lost. A 20-year-old dying means losing decades of voting. A 70-year-old dying? You're only losing a few electoral cycles."
673,Other than the increased amount of work and the commute what stops a governor/state level representative/mayor from running in two elections and doing both jobs?,"For state offices, it’d be state-by-state. The US Constitution says basically nothing about eligibility for state office, except for certain antidiscrimination rules (you can’t say “only whites may be elected governor”). However, you might run into trouble with residency requirements, ballot access requirements (some states don’t let you run in multiple elections simultaneously), or other things in state laws or constitutions."
674,Why has President Biden imposed sanctions on Nicaragua?,"Ortega threw his entire political opposition into jail.

Like there’s reason for sanctions alone from that basic fact. Not even newspapers critical of the regime are allowed to operate anymore and the editor of a major newspaper was thrown into jail without due process.

Plus, Daniel Ortega ran for a 4th term as President after changing the constitution in 2014 (previously Presidents were limited to 2 terms). So this would mean Nicaragua has collapsed into a dictatorship - which means you get sanctioned. Them’s the shakes.

Some of the people in the comments here look awful silly defending all this. Read the news more and elevate everything to ideological warfare less. Or at least talk to some actual Nicaraguans unhappy with the situation.

EDIT: Some additional information on the kinds of sanctions levied on Nicaragua:

Now here's a time where it might actually be helpful to read [the list of sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0481) actually placed on Nicaraguan officials.

We have sanctions on 9 individuals:

* Three mayors of small cities
* the Minister of Energy and Mines
* The ambassador to Egypt
* The President of a Nicaraguan government-affiliated think tank
* A managing director of an electric distribution regulator
* A superintendent within the Public Ministry
* The Vice Minister of Finance.

So what's important here is that the sanctions merely withhold these 9 individuals from accessing US bank accounts and buying US property - that's it. The sanctions aren't a trade embargo, which some people seem to have mistaken it for."

During the later 1800's it was extended to civilians; most required a reason or condition and absentee ballot had to be requested either in person or in writing.

The U.S. Constitution gives the power to the states under Article 1, Section 4 which provides  that it’s up to each state to determine “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections.”

Oregon was the first state to go completely by mail in 2000. During the pandemic, however almost 25% the population voted by mail. Other voted early or on election day."

There are limits to plausibility and some things would go so far that most judges wouldn't be willing to go along with it.

A longer term counter would be that the chamber of congress that opposes such could refuse to pass budgets, thus resulting in most of the federal government shutting down due to lack of money."

You could refer to control and majorities, though. Republicans gained control of the WH, Senate, and House. Or by gaining majorities in Congress they gained control of the federal government. Never heard it called a trifecta, though - not entirely sure that's an accurate conceptual framework."
680,Why would Maine voters vote for Susan Collins?,"In short, because politics rarely ever operate as simply or consistently nationally as pundits and the public think about them, especially around the blue-red turf idea. While a lot of people are party-line voters, that doesn't matter so much for more people than you'd think. 

Having said that, I'll try to oversimplify and treat the state as one consistent block. 

The core of it: Maine (and New Hampshire and Vermont) have a huge mentality of state identity. And with that, Susan Collins capitalised on three key parts of it 1) being a ""true Maine"" gal 2) being known for being a Mainer and 3) again trying to distance her and Gideon on what that means.

On the first:

I haven't worked super extensively in Maine politics but New Hampshire carries the same, and any state or local election, I can tell you one of the first questions from the public when learning about a candidate is always where they're from. As an illustrative example, I once sat in on an 'endorsement debate' near Derry, NH - basically where the candidates for a local seat field questions from those attending and it's generally understood that's where the local political influencers decide who they'll endorse. One of the most popular candidates got the question, ""Did you grow up here?"". To which he said - ""I have lived in the greater Derry area for the last 40 years of my life, my wife is from Windham and my kids have all grown up in Derry schools. But I was born in Lawrence and moved here when I was 14"". And the audience take away was that he was from Massachusetts (Lawrence, MA is a 15 minute drive away from Derry). 

All that story to say, they take it seriously. People in Maine draw a similar hard line around the idea of who is 'one of us' in terms of being a Mainer or a Maine-iac. Susan Collins is undeniably in that line - she's from Caribou which is the most hardcore of upcountry, beautiful land, and a life of grit and hard-work -- picture lumberjacks in red flannel shirts sipping whisky in a small town pub after a long day and that is Caribou. It's like someone in Texas being a cattle rancher or someone in Florida being a Cuban-American orange grove farmer with a food shack on the beach. You just can't get a more stereotyped background to represent the state. And that's her background to a tee - her family is from Caribou, coming from a multi-generational family business in lumber, with family representing the area in local politics for generations. Sara Gideon, despite a long life in Maine, is 'from away' as they say. She is originally from Rhode Island and Mainers think about that and knew that and Collins pushed it hard. If you're from a state where populations are transient or often from out of state (used to be a time not long ago where it was rare to find someone in Florida who was ""*from* Florida"") that may seem odd but to them it's almost everything. 

On the second:

A lot of it is name recognition and affiliation. 

Susan Collins has been Senator for a long time and apart from some tension around abortion rights and Supreme Court nominees, she has been able to maintain a rather centre of the road reputation that is more popular in Maine statewide politics (with the exception of Lepage). And with that, people in Maine have known her for a long time and have heard her name for a long time and to be frank, haven't been given a ton of reason to complain except for those issues cited above which were quite recent at the time (but we'll get back to that). 

So they all know her, they know her as 'one of theirs' and most hadn't been given extreme reason to be upset with her. Sara Gideon, despite being Speaker in the state legislature, obviously didn't have as high a profile. So the campaign needed to 'introduce her' to the public a lot more - which again in a state that values the idea of 'one of ours' for someone who is technically 'from away' is difficult. Especially since Gideon's role there was a bit masked during most of the campaign by the fact that the state legislature wasn't meeting because of agenda and COVID. 

And on the third:

Collins took all of the above and pushed it hard. Gideon had to introduce herself and Collins took every opportunity to hit the hard points - that Gideon is 'from away', that Gideon isn't a known quantity in what she does (while Collins had a long history in the Senate now and in Maine politics), that Gideon (self-described) was not a middle road moderate but a progressive, that Gideon didn't have the same values as Maine, and that Gideon was 'from away' and reflected the needs of people 'from away' not of Mainers. 

Some of these I've already covered a bit but another part of it is that yes, Gideon was a self-described progressive. Probably not to the extent a lot of people in the country consider particularly progressive but for Maine, who apart from Lepage, has a general tendency towards electing middle road moderates (on either side of the aisle) on most things statewide, it was easier to paint her with the wider attack on Democrats as all leftists. 

That plus Gideon's being 'from away' also was hurt by the fact that she wasn't a known name, and with that needed to fundraise to keep up. Which did mean getting a lot of external help. She got hit for the number of out of state fundraisers she was doing - with attacks that she was flying to New York and San Francisco and South Florida and DC and LA more than she was in Maine (not true but the attack and idea landed). To make that worse, Gideon's team did rely quite heavily on DNC and national Democratic supporting groups - which led to a lot of national focused talking points - when again, Maine cares most about Maine, not feeling like they're getting the messages from DC. And with the idea that they don't like hard line rules on party A or party B, no crossing sides, a lot of the national attack messaging points were trying to associate Collins with Trump -- which again, didn't work because Mainers generally 1) already 'knew' Collins so trying to change her reputation there was an uphill climb 2) Mainers generally like the idea of 'compromise' and working within that middle band of moderates on both sides of the aisle, so a hardline TrumpTrumpTrump was actually a positive than a negative. 

And with that - Collins painted it well as Gideon being aggressive and mean and one-minded and out of touch with how people in Maine are. She sold it as, you know me - your long-term friend and senator Susan. I'm just here trying to talk to you but this out of owner doesn't know how we do things here and is being mean and nasty to me, your friend Susan that you know. She hit on that a lot especially towards the end - that Gideon was being mean spirited, and that's not what Mainers value. You ever see a neighbour or an aunt or someone that you like get in an argument where you know they're wrong? But then the person they're arguing with crosses the line and suddenly you don't care if they're wrong or not, that's *your* person and nobody talks to them like that. That's the argument basically Collins tried to make and it was effective."
681,Can we push for rules at the state level that regulate congresspeople running for election at the federal level?,"No, that wouldn't work. State level restrictions or requirements on congressional candidates have been tried before but they were struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. The House of Representatives (and the Senate after the 17th Amendment) represent the people, not the states. Therefore the states have no right to regulate Congressional candidacies or campaigns beyond what's necessary for purely operational concerns (e.g. minimum signature requirements or monetary fees for ballot access to ensure efficiently run elections)."
682,Why did Biden expand Remain in Mexico?,"He was forced by court order after lawsuits from Texas and Missouri.

Edit: it's not really an expansion. Any immigrant trying to cross into the US from Mexico is subject to it. I'm fairly certain that was always the case.

Edit2: it does appear to be an expansion, likely due to increase in immigrants from places like Haiti, who speak other languages. He also expanded the exceptions to the application so it's not all bad."
683,"How is it that a state that sends Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul to the Senate can elect a Democrat as Governor, even a moderate/conservative Democrat?","Actual Kentuckian here.  It's a complicated answer, but one part of it I always flag when I see (usually feral) redditors asking a (usually much less polite) version of this question is that once one party and especially one candidate gains a real foothold in a state, the other party often chooses to spend their money elsewhere.

Kentuckians are relatively blue, for what their electoral history suggests, as Beshear's election shows us.  So why McConnell?

He's a successful politician who managed to win enough times that he could cement his power.  At some point the Democratic party decided that, rather than throw money at him trying to unseat him in increasingly expensive races, they'd put that money to use in other, closer races.  Their party structure atrophied, and now they only run joke candidates against him.

Last election, when Georgia went blue (and when the only way to beat McConnell was to mobilize black voters in our urban areas) instead of a charismatic, left-moderate young black candidate they ran some white centrist lady who had been a fighter pilot, looked like a mean volleyball coach, did a lot of shouting, and had no appeal or coherent vision for the key demographics in play.  And of course they underfunded her.

McConnell's campaign strategy was to literally laugh in her face. And it worked."
684,"Suppose a state chose to enforce a gun control law in defiance of a SCOTUS decision, what would happen?","Good intuition - you guessed the answer already! History tells us that the federal government will try legal, financial, and political pressure first, but yes, ultimately the authority of the federal government is backed by the armed forces.

In 1954, the Supreme Court decided *Brown v. Bd. of Education*, declaring that all state laws that established segregated schools violated the 14th Amendment. (The actual history of *Brown* at the Supreme Court is more complicated...there were lots of follow-up cases, but you don't need to know that now.)

In Little Rock, Arkansas, pro-segregationist groups threatened to hold 'protests' at Central High School to prevent black students (""the Little Rock Nine"") from entering. The Governor of AR, Orval Faubus, deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists and block the entrance to the school.

President Eisenhower held a meeting with Faubus warning him not to defy the SCOTUS ruling to no avail. At the request of the Mayor of Little Rock, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to enforce integration. (He also ""federalized"" the Arkansas National Guard - placed it under federal command - though whose orders they would actually have followed without the presence of federal troops is probably an open question.) The nine black students were literally marched into school by the Airborne, and were guarded by a mix of Airborne and AR National Guard troops for the rest of the year."
685,"Why is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine now, and not when Trump was still president?","Not everything in the world revolves around who's President of the USA at any given time.  Putin has had a long term campaign to destabilize Ukraine, and prevent it from gaining the security it would have under a NATO nuclear umbrella. Also to destabilize NATO, and you can see that now with the Russian back effort to weaponize refugees."

He actually worked with criminal elements as a partner to keep his properties well-valued and to keep his personal brand going - hence the trail of criminal associates he's had."
689,How have Biden’s immigration policies differed from Trump’s?,"Biden hasn’t actually done anything differently and has kept Trump’s more draconian border policies in place. The perceived increase in immigration at the border is largely due to things outside his control - increased violence in Honduras, Guatemala, a collapse of government in Haiti, etcetera. There are more people applying for asylum but that’s different than people formally immigrating, so we need to keep the different types of migration separate. 

and the solution of a ‘border wall’ remains as stupid and inefficient as it has always been. Texas is probably doing that only because it’s a way to pander to the Republican base. Nobody with a hint of knowledge about the border knows it would accomplish anything."
690,"Since the unvaccinated make up most COVID deaths, and conservatives are more likely to be unvaccinated, why does the Republican party seem to be staunchly against the vaccination?","The right-wing political establishment has lost control of the right-wing voter base.

They got the presidency and the Senate and they got their judges and their massive tax cut. But now there's a problem: the crazies have realized that they *like* politics and they *like* power, and they're strategically distributed across the country just perfectly. Social media has allowed them to believe they they're a majority, and they don't want to go back in the racist, sexist, bigot closet.

So now, they've decided that vaccine opposition is the latest culture war to fight and there are enough either true believers or grifters on the Right that they can find someone to vote for who shares their views. Whereas previously the ultra-conservative zealots could be safely ignored (because the country was more evenly split) now the Republicans need every vote. And alienating the anti-vaxxers will cost them more voters then COVID will kill."
691,Why is there so much difference in quality of life and things like corruption between democratic countries?,"I'm currently reading a book on this very topic called *Why Nations Fail*. That's probably one of the best places to start looking at this topic in some depth.

But if you want my woefully insufficient answer, a large part of is that the actual democratic institutions of these various places are wildly varying in quality. To look at your examples, Mexico's democracy is barely functioning which trickles down into the quality of their policies. Meanwhile, in Denmark and Sweden we have democracies that have functioned at arguably the highest level for quite a long time, which has directly affected the quality of their policies.

There's obviously a lot more to it, including the question of why Mexico's democracy is so inadequate compared to Sweden's or Denmark's, but if you'd like a deeper look into those things then take a look at the book I recommended."
692,Writing Fiction: How do US elections work before election day?,"There are usually a few debates in the month before Election Day. That's where candidates are going to interact the most. I don't know how much interacting they'd do in private, but they could be stuck in a green room together for a little bit and have to talk there."
693,Who determines what constitutes misinformation?,"I think one of the issues is that we, the public, seek quick answers for things that require a nuanced explanation, so a lot ""dumbing down"" occurs to translate from a fuzzy set of weighted possibilities, into a solid conclusion. 

This makes things ripe for misinformation, at the very least because of misunderstanding. Either the author misunderstands the study they're writing about, or the reader misunderstands the implication the author was trying to convey.

On top of that, there is often a motivation for the author to convey some point, or to at least put this ""new information"" into a larger context. We seek to find order, or some narrative, in the world around us, and authors - in their drive to grab our attention - have learned how to do that. But this more often distorts the reality of the new information, especially since the context it exists in is entirely too complicated to convey in words, let alone a short article. 

But all that is to explain why people can disagree on more or less ""honest"" reporting. Misinformation often refers to *unintentional falsities*, usually due to what I described above. *Dis*information only refers to *intentionally false* information meant to mislead.

Disinformation is often easier to call out, because the claims are usually blatantly false, however the fact that politics are so divided prevents people from paying attention to the correction via confirmation bias. And sometimes, disinformation is unclear, or makes claims that can neither be confirmed or denied, which makes them even more believable for those who want them to be true, even without any supporting evidence. The most clear example of this would be Trump's ""Big Lie"" that has repeatedly been debunked in courts, yet still persists.

So who determines what constitutes *dis*information? Anyone who can prove it is false, I guess. That's really all you have to do.

edit: That last thing I said is a bit too simplified. Proving it false is only enough to show that it is *mis*information. In order to claim *dis*information, you have to show that it is not only false, but there is reason to believe that the person who made the false claim did so for an ulterior motive, not just out of ignorance."
694,Rise of Catholic Influence in the US?,"I don't think there is a rise of Catholicism as much as a convergence of Catholics at the same time.  First keep in mind Biden is the second catholic president ever the first being Kennedy, considering that 22% of the US population is Catholic Catholics have been woefully under represented as president.  Regarding the Catholics on the SC of the 114 justices only 13 have been catholic, so again an under represented group, with the vast majority (90+) being protestant.  Of the six Catholics in the SC five are very conservative which is not very reflective of Catholics in general which are pretty evenly split between parties.  What the right wing justices do have in common is their desire to overturn Roe V Ware and that is likely the reason at least 2 of them were appointed.

&#x200B;

The Catholic church is no more connected with Fascism or White Nationalism than any other church and I world go as far to say they are less likely to be involved in both of those groups simply because they are not welcome.  Catholics are not considered Christians by many ""christians"" and groups like the KKK considered Catholics equally despicable as people of color, many a Catholic in the south had a cross burned on their lawns."
695,Did they do the Second Default bill yet? Google isn't helping.,I think I heard the vote is tomorrow or Wednesday.
696,What are some great ways to make a name for yourself in your community?,"If you want to become and elected official I encourage you to simply throw your hat in the ring at the local level.  It's a pretty low barrier to entry, not a lot of signatures to get on the ballot and not a lot of money -literally a few hundred dollars.  Then it's all up to you, if you want to get your name out you need to put in the work.  Again at the local level this is easy to do, my father was a local politico and knocked on the door of every person in his district well into his 70's -imagine how many doors you could knock on and how many people you can talk to at your young age.  Start going to public events and talk to the people running them, let them get to know you.  If church is your thing, that's another good place to start and even if it isn't it's not a bad thing to get to know the church leaders in your community.  Finally start putting in some work for elected officials in your area, start scratching their back and they will scratch yours."
697,Why has corruption remained a problem at the highest level of Brazilian politics?,"It may have something to do with democracy being rather young in Brazil. I wanna say that Brazil was under a military junta as recently as 1983? Often the younger a democracy, the more shaky it is. In addition, it's worth looking at Brazil's economy and strength of the rule of law. Corruption is usually born out of desperation somewhere. People take bribes and skim off the top do so either because the chances of getting caught are low, or because the competition to have enough to live is so intense that breaking the law is a risk worth taking."
698,Why isn't prostitution legalized already in most first world countries?,"But, it kind of is legal under certain circumstances in UK, Germany, Australia, etc.


Just not the US because I think it was historically somewhat Puritan based and is just catching up with some things."
699,"Could it be argued that the European countries and the USA are primarily responsible for most of the problems in worldwide politics and thus, economics?","Let me put it this way: think about a world history where Europe and the US didn't exist. Would all the problems you're thinking about go away? Of course not. Your thought here is far too simplistic.

Let's look at the Middle East. You talk about the issue of colonialism as the source of all problems there. Well, for one thing, that's not really correct. It wasn't the US or Britain that started the civil war in Syria. It wasn't the US or Britain that put Mubarak in Egypt or made him super corrupt. The US was actually supporting Saddam Hussein in Iraq for quite a while...until he decided to invade Iran unprovoked, and then did it again later in Kuwait. These are just a handful of examples. Anwar Sadat wasn't murdered by the CIA. There's as much internal strife here as there is external.

Plus, if America and Europe just fell below the sea forever, do you think other countries wouldn't fill that void? As you've already suggested, Russia and China have expansionist ideals. A good part of the US and European policies recently have been about opposing Russian encroachment. What happens if those protections go away? Even if we forget about that, why are we only looking at the *recent* colonization? Before Europe's rise, the Middle East was conquered land by the Ottomans. The Ottomans took it from the Byzantines (Romans). The Byzantines took it from the Greeks. The Greeks took it from the Persians, I think, and before that, we had Assyrian and Babylonian empires ruling that land. Before THAT is was the Hebrews conquering that land. 

That area has been war torn and full conflict since human kind developed society because the kinds of urges that led the US and Europe to create conflict there are urges in all of humans. Sure, the US and Europe have led the charge in most recent history, but to think of them as ruthless aggressors and everyone else as peace loving innocents is woefully simplistic."
700,"With Russia threatening to invade Ukraine, and after election interference, troll farms, constant state sponsored cyber attacks and scams, could an effective sanction be for the international community to block Russia from the internet completely?","Russia tested a national intranet, separate from the Internet, back in 2019. No idea how that went."
701,"How much is the issue of crime and homelessness in massive cities due to Democrat decisions/legislation, and how much of it is coincidental because (D) voters tend to gravitate to massive cities where these problems are extremely likely to happen regarldess?",You vote Democratic. You vote for Democrats. You vote for a Democrat.
702,Are Russia and China’s talks about annexing Ukraine and Taiwan coordinated?,"No, Russia and China don’t have this kind of relationship. 

They cooperate where their interests intertwine. In Afghanistan and Syria, for example. And while their opposition to American hegemony makes them allies of convenience, there’s a fundamental distrust there that goes back to the Cold War. As well, Russia is far more hostile to American interests than China, whose own interests are actually pretty intertwined with America’s. Obviously China is vehemently opposed to American influence within what it views as its sphere, and China steals our trade secrets and embeds spies, but fundamentally, whereas Russia actively tries to destabilize American society, China benefits a lot more from ongoing American stability. We’re still it’s largest export market, and they own a shitload of American Treasuries. 

There’s no real credible threat to Taiwanese border integrity. If anything, Taiwan is in the best position it’s been since the Kuomintang fled mainland China. Biden has made several overtures acknowledging Taiwan’s existence. It’s not a full break from our foreign policy of formal non-recognition, but it’s still significant. China huffs and puffs about Taiwan, but for now at least, it’s all just rhetoric. 

Russia, on the other hand, will invade Ukraine any day. Whereas China has no strategic advantage to be gained by invading Taiwan, Russia very much does in Ukraine, which offers farmland, land routes and most importantly, access to warm water ports. In addition, there’s a very real cultural and demographic divide between East and West Ukraine. Most eastern Ukrainians speak Russian, and consider themselves ethnically Rus, or native Russians. Honestly, its ‘invading’ forces would be welcome by most eastern Ukrainians. Most

 American media misrepresents the ongoing civil war there, and there’s a common misconception that Russia is just fomenting unrest to make a land grab. It would be ridiculous to have ever expected Russia to abide by a pro-western Ukraine gov hostile to its interests. It would be like expecting to live with a Pro-ISIS Canada government. Russia has always viewed the access to warm waters and a land route to Europe that a friendly Ukraine provides as critical to its national security. 

Also, Russia isn’t trying to annex ALL of Ukraine, just the half which goes roughly as west as Donetsk. This half  satisfies those strategic security interests. And Russia has a legitimate claim, here, in that were the people of eastern Ukraine allowed to self-determine their future, they’d overwhelmingly vote to secede from Ukraine and more likely than not agree to Russian annexation.

But, answering your question, China is indifferent to Russia’s claims in Ukraine, as Russia is to Chinas claims to Taiwan. Neither has anything to gain by the other’s territorial aggression, in this case. And whereas Taiwan is symbolically important to China, Ukraine is strategically important to Russia. East Ukraine is important enough to russia that it’s worth pissing off the entire West to them. Taiwan just isn’t THAT important for China. This is just not an area where cooperation makes any sense. That said, China will almost certainly join Russia in voting against any UNSC retaliatory action against Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity bc China doesn’t want to be put in the hypocritical position of having to defend its pretty similar violations of international law norms in Hong Kong and the South Asian Sea."
703,How much blame would the Biden administration get if Russia overwhelms Ukraine in early 2022?,"Not nearly as much blame as Afghanistan. First off, Biden is having actual communication with both sides along with our allies, France, Germany, UK, and Italy. 

Russia has been threatened with some fairly detrimental deterrents, such as international trade sanctions if they invade. Also, the US is already bolstering the Ukraine with munitions. 

If Russia goes in the fault is 100% on them at this point. The Biden administration is handling this pretty well from a PR perspective at this point in time."
704,Is there any less obvious reason for the whole Russian-Ukraine border thing?,"No idea whether they are committed to actually invading at some point, but I think at this stage it is part of a hybrid ""testing the west"" strategy that also includes their tacit approval of Belarus actively sending refugees to the Polish border and the various (mis-)information campaigns they have been running and some other stuff. 

To stay with the Ukrainian border issue: Them amassing the troops is in my reading not necessarily just in preparation of an invasion. I don't think they are on a one-way street towards invasion. Rather they are building various pressure points and a trying to see what the reaction from NATO/the EU/the US is. If they meet no opposition, they may go ahead. If the EU f.e. mounts some kind of response that makes it impossible to do a proper invasion, there still might be cracks in the EU foreign policy and their commitment to Ukraine. If NATO massively moves troops into Ukraine to prepare for an attack, well at the very least you can turn around and use that to paint them as warmongers against innocent old Russia."
705,Where are the farmers (in this bill)‽,"The bill does a few things that benefit farmers and rural communities, albeit without explicitly naming “farmers” in the legislative text. 

First, it postpones pay reductions for physicians who accept Medicare. This is especially important in rural hospitals (e.g. farming communities) where the majority of patients use Medicare to pay for health care services. 

Second, it includes a bill that supports suicide awareness and prevention. In times of economic hardship, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are often increases in farmer suicide. The suicide of health care providers in rural areas is also important to address if the goal is to ensure farmers maintain access to care."
706,Why is the OSHA covid mandate only for employers with 100 or more employees instead of all employers?,"I believe regular testing is an option too.

Most rules exempt small businesses of a certain size because it’s a pain to enforce. There are LLCs with 1-2 employees strewn across my apartment building, much less the entire country. There’s also the understanding that the bigger a company, the more resources and ergo responsibility an employer has. There is little excuse for not following through on federal requirements once you reach a certain size."
707,"Why don't both Democrats and Republics want to have more moderate candidates, statistically speaking?","Low voter participation means that the stronger your voter’s beliefs, the more likely they are to overcome participation inertia and the more likely you are to win. 

Single issue voters have the strongest beliefs and the strongest believers are also the most extreme."
708,What if the US just straight up recognize Taiwan?,It wouldn’t be rational for the PRC to invade but they’d still do it. Ultranationalism is nutty like that.
709,"With a phone call between Biden and Putin on the schedule, I started to wonder how does a conversation between world leaders usually sound like?","Well apparently these high ranking calls between world leaders actually sound like this:

>	The President: I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it’s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.

>	President Zelenskyy Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100% but 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

>	The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.

>	President Zelenskyy: The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.

>	The President: Well, she’s going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people"
710,Can i be an internationalist as rightist?,Define ‘internationalist’ and ‘rightist.’ What are the contradictions you’re thinking through here
711,How do the policies and ideology of Bernie Sanders compare against those of Clement Attlee?,"Domestically, I think they’d be pretty similar. Attlee’s social programs legacy aligns with what, if he had a magic wand, Sen. Sanders would likely want to achieve. Examples of Attlee’s successes which Sen. Sanders echoes: the establishment of a national health care system (NHS vs Medicare for All), the strengthening of organized labor, and broader social programs like vastly increasing the role of government in creating affordable housing. 

Where they begin to diverge, I’d think, would be on foreign policy. Attlee’s station as a prime minister was obviously much different in terms of time and powers to a modern U.S. Senator. But given Sen. Sander’s positions on modern foreign policy issues, it isn’t difficult to see why they might end up making different decisions had they been contemporaries.

Attlee, for example, supporter and initiated the UK’s nuclear weapons program. It is difficult to imagine Sen. Sander’s doing that. Attlee was also a quasi-imperialist, whereas Sen. Sanders is anything but. (This last point is a bit nuanced; Attlee oversaw the drawdown of British involvement in a number of arenas due to their cost, some of which had disastrous outcomes the world wouldn’t come to understand until decades later. He managed the transition to the modern British Commonwealth from the harder version of imperialism that preceded it. Still, were Sen. Sanders in charge of U.S. foreign policy I think we’d see a very different tact.)"
712,Why are the same people who are pro gun also pro police,"Those are some pretty big generalizations. I'll share my view. 

What is pro-gun? What makes one pro-gun? 

Most people I know of who are pro-gun see the gun as a tool. Guns don't fire themselves, they need a person to do so. That person's intent may be good or bad, the gun is still just a tool. 

Shooting is a sport. It's not abnormal to like sports, so this seems natural. There is a sizeable portion of people who use a gun and never kill a thing with it.  Target shooting is fun, and challenging. 

Rural living is different. There is a reality that the police can't help rural folks based on distance traveled. If someone is breaking into your home, they will be gone by the time police arrive (This happens in the city too). If you want to protect your rural home, you likely have a gun.  Personally, I don't like to kill. But I'm very glad I had a shotgun when the rattlesnake showed up in my front yard. I'm to chicken to get close enough to the rattlesnake. 

What is pro-police? Does it mean blindly backing police? I don't think so. Does it mean overall believe in a strong police force that enforces the law? I think that is the correct definition. 

As I'm sitting here trying to come up with reasons why one would be pro-police, the answer keeps coming back to why not? 

Are there bad police? Yes. The majority? No. If you were a victim of a crime, would you call them? Unless the answer is no, then you'd be pro-cop too. 

When the police have to deal with people like Michael Brown (hands up don't shoot guy), there is no good outcome, and it leads to people losing faith in the police, which is very unfair to them."
713,Why was a texas abortion law allowed to stand but the less restrictive Mississippi ban is being heard by SCOTUS?,The court only declined to issue an emergency injunction preventing enforcement of the Texas abortion law while substantive challenges to it are being litigated.  There has been no ruling on the law’s constitutionality yet.
714,"What members of the federal Congress voted against additions of new states, and why?","This is on Wikipedia which you can use to find other sources.

Use the different words for state admission. I literally found the information you wanted for Hawaii in about 20seconds.

Admission, ratification, act, vote, etc.  

The first one is free but I'm not going to all your research for you. Hawaii Admission Act. Google it."
715,Is newsnation doing something right or are they just a different flavor of propaganda?,"If you're looking for something to trust, while nothing is perfect, the best you're going to get is the wire services: AP and Reuters."
716,Is Enes Kanter the only prominent Gülen supporter to recognize the Armenian genocide?,Is Enes Kanter actually a ‘Gulenist?’ He went to a school vaguely affiliated with Gulen when he was a kid but that does not a Gulenist make.
717,What is North Korea's democracy like?,"There isn't.  It's ""Democratic"" in name only, like the ""Socialist"" in *National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis).  They have ""elections"", but those are just for show.  It's pretty much the definition of a dictatorship, with a single family having ruled for decades."
718,"[American Politics] Why do Right-Leaning folk (Republicans, Libertarians, Trumpists) hate the Left?","I consider myself left-leaning, but I'll attempt to best articulate the ""hate against Leftists"" from right leaners and moderates. The main problems seems to be the ""woke-ism"" on cultural issues and impracticality of major economic decisions. 

Most of them really don't care about the over-the-top evil stuff that the conspiracy theorists are crowing about. This is a minority view, and none of my Newsmax-watching co-workers really pay attention to that stuff. This isn't to say Q-anon and other conspiracies are not a major problem, but they are still confined to the fringe right (for now).

It's the Critical Race Theory, defund the police, white people are inherently evil, higher taxes, higher gas prices, cancel culture over saying there are only two genders, shutting down the economy, and commie-socialism that annoys them more. Having more of THAT stuff be in the future of country seems to be scaring the center-right moderates. 

However, I think the biggest problem for our country's future is 2020 election results and the fallout from that. I think the number of registered Republican voters who thought the election was ""stolen"" has been rising and is way too high. The number of times I've been asked to explain how much the election results swung at 3am in Wisconsin is enough to get me worried, even after I've explained it multiple times. It happens every couple of months. 

""How do I know that mail-in ballots were legit?""

Questioning the legitimacy of an election is a sore spot for me because I was one of those who entertained the idea that Trump conspired with the Russians in 2016 way more than I should have, which ended up being a nothing-burger. Two failed impeachments, a year plus investigation into Russiagate that uncovered nothing to act on. While I think the Democrats had greater causes for concern, the fact that we rejected the legitimacy of the Trump presidency for pretty much the whole term makes the Left look like hypocrites for decrying the Right's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the Biden presidency. 

Was there 2020 Election fraud? No, there wasn't. There wasn't a Trump-Russia conspiracy either. While Russia DID try their best to interfere in the election, and factored into a Trump victory, there was no evidence to support that Trump had a direct line to Russia to coordinate a campaign. Trump won the Electoral College with the help of voters that believed in him or distrusted the political establishment long before Russia thought to exploit that distrust, and that's what mattered."
719,How does gerrymandering work? and how is it even allowed?,"Gerrymandering for partisan political advantage is constitutional.  Gerrymandering specifically to stifle minority votes isn't.
One reason the issue is being talked about more now is that the Supreme Court eliminated parts of the Voting Rights Act of the 1960's which required some states to pre-clear their changes with the Federal government (which was based on the long history of those states suppressing votes in the times before that).

Democrats are trying to fight back, but they don't have enough power in the Senate to get things done.  The filibuster applies to voting rights changes, and they do not have enough votes to eliminate the filibuster, nor enough votes to do it in spite of a filibuster."
720,What drives the Russian Government to wanting Ukraine and the other Baltic states back?,Russia knows there won't be World War 3 over this.  They're good at pushing absolutely as much as they can without serious blowback.  If they take over Ukraine it'll be a death by a thousand cuts scenario until something justifies their final putsch.
721,"Why do many Americans take issue when the President is not elected by popular vote, but are not upset over the fact that the Senate gives equal voting power to all states regardless of population, and has (almost) equal powers to the House (which uses population)?","People complain about the senate being ""land voting instead of people"" all the time.  It just tends to get drowned out by the Presidential elections.  There is also a divide along party lines, since the current situation favors the Republican's/rural States vs the States with more voters who tend to go Democratic.  The flip side, of course, is that the Democrats have an advantage in the House since they're more popular with more people.  The problem is that the Republican party has decided that it can rule without a majority of the population supporting it by using the system against the voting public.  And that's a big threat to democracy."
722,Can you be a patriot and not love your government?,"That guy might have meant country or nation when he said government.  I hope.  I think that in a democratic society (the only type that's legitimate) the citizens should be highly critical of the parties and people in charge.  Especially when those elected members are the ones that you voted for.  It's like loving a pizza restaurant, but disliking the current management after you got a bad pie.  It's not that you hate pizza now.  It's just that the guys in charge aren't doing things right."
723,"What is the ""christian-democrat"" ideology called in American politics?","It sounds something like ""compassionate conservatism,"" which had its heyday (at least as a brand) in the George W. Bush years. That was before I was paying much attention to politics, but as I understand it the core idea was to use government to promote community support to the disadvantaged. The Bush White House released an [official statement](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/04/20020430.html) about how it defined the term.

Caveat: I don't express any opinion on the actual policies of the Bush administration. I'm just talking about the stated philosophy."
724,How do conservatives view adults with disabilities and assistance?,"The ADA was established with bipartisan support. The stance of conservatives has always been if it isn't broken, don't fix it. Therefore, if you need it, have it. Just look at all they do for disabled veterans. The *most recent* evidence of this is the bill that passed in the House 424 to 3 to fund mental health treatment for law enforcement and other first responders."
725,Can the Republicans rely on practical unknowns like Youngkin to win big next year?,"Probably not. Virginia is sort of an exceptional case - no President’s party has held that governorship after winning the Presidency, with I think one exception. McAuliffe was also a generally clueless candidate who didn’t run very well, and Youngkin had a personal fortune to bankroll his campaign that a lot of people just don’t have. 

We already know who the GOP is putting up in key races in the coming years and the only unknown I can think of, really, is whoever the Republican candidate for PA senate is since Parnell dropped out. In GA, they’re running either Eric Greitens or Herschel Walker, both of whom are well known. In OH, it’s JD Vance or Josh Mandel - also known quantities. 

If the GOP wins back governorships it will be through juicing turnout while disenfranchising Democratic voters as fast as possible. Individual races are too variable to say one way or the other its best to run an unknown."
726,Why is Biden releasing gasoline from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep gas prices low?,"Only the Sith speak in absolutes. Of course Biden genuinely wants to reduce carbon emissions. But folks do still use gas and high gas prices create different economic problems. Of course Biden should care about that.

Politics is about balancing competing priorities. Having a good economy where Americans can afford things is desirable. Curbing carbon emissions is desirable. Sometimes these things conflict, and you can't pursue both at the same time, or you can in some ways but not in others.

Put another way, if you feel you spend too much time watching porn, do you celebrate impotence? Of course not. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean you'll accept literally any solution to that thing."
727,Wouldn't a Chinese invasion of Taiwan lead to a war with NATO?,"No. NATO's collective defense provision is Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which says:

> The Parties agree that **an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all** and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

> Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.

Article 6 elaborates:

> For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:

> * on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France, on the territory of Turkey or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;
> * on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.

Article 5 doesn't cover attacks on NATO members' expeditionary forces outside the North Atlantic region. It doesn't necessarily cover *Hawaii* (which is outside North America and the North Atlantic), let alone Taiwan."
728,Why would a government keep information that incriminates themselves classified? What is stopping them from simply destroying the evidence?,Simple reason is they might need to reference things in those documents. Just because you don't want other people finding out doesn't mean you don't still need to know what's in them.
729,Is School Board a good starting point for a political career?,"Any elected position can act as a springboard for a higher elected position. It gives that person practical experience in governing (which, like any other skill, needs to be practiced) plenty of opportunities to make connections with other local political figures (elected or appointed), chances to attach their name to various initiatives and projects, as well as increasing name recognition which is crucial for politicians. 

If you look at the [list of current US senators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_senators), I counted four who have ""school board"" in their experience. 

Any practical experience in politics, governing, or activism will help. It'll help you build community ties and figure out local political dynamics. In this sense, the tv show Parks and Rec is actually a great practical guide. The main character, Leslie Knope, starts off as an unelected bureaucrat but uses that position to build relationships, governance skills, and name recognition which helps her obtain higher elected office."
730,"Why shouldn't, doesn't Biden tweet his successes? I believe this would negate a lot of the negative press he is getting.","He does. [Half the things he's tweeted lately are about the infrastructure bill,](https://twitter.com/JoeBiden), declining unemployment claims, about new initiatives for Native American tribes, etc. The other half is about what passing the Build Back Better law would do.

Tweeting about something doesn't force the media to cover it."
731,Why isn't concept of protected classes a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment?,"Protected classes are there to remedy both past and ongoing discrimination.  In this sense, they ensure that the Equal Protection Clause really does apply to everyone.  We can't say that any form of discrimination is unconstitutional, because all laws affect some people more than others.  So protected classes is how we draw that line."
732,How will the broadband portion of the infrastructure bill be distributed?,"Each U.S. state will be given at least 100 million dollars in funding as a grant for broadband development. There is 42.45 billion to give out in total.

H.R. 3684, Division F, Title I, Section 60102 (c)

(2) Minimum initial allocation.--Of the amount appropriated pursuant to subsection (b)(2)--            (A) except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph,

$100,000,000 shall be allocated to each State; and

(B) $100,000,000 shall be allocated to, and divided equally  among, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.        (3) Allocation of remaining amounts.--

(A) In general.--On or after the date on which the broadband DATA maps are made public, of the amount appropriated  pursuant to subsection (b)(2),

the Assistant Secretary shall allocate to eligible entities, in accordance with subparagraph         (B) of this paragraph, the amount remaining after compliance with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.

The ways to prevent money grabbing:

Division F, Title I, Section 60102 (f)

(3) Deobligation of awards; internet disclosure.--The Assistant Secretary--

(A) shall establish, in coordination with relevant Federal and State partners, appropriate mechanisms to ensure appropriate use of funds made available under this section;

(B) may, in addition to other authority under applicable law--

(i) deobligate grant funds awarded to an eligible entity that--

(I) violates paragraph (2); or (II) demonstrates an insufficient level of  performance, or wasteful or fraudulent spending, as defined in advance by the Assistant Secretary;...

The thing is that - as one example - Comcast, has partly done what this subsection of the act intends. The IEPP (Internet Essentials Partnership Program) - which it seems was easier to implement due to Comcast's now ten year running Internet Essentials Program ([https://www.internetessentials.com/](https://www.internetessentials.com/))  - was/is implemented with school systems (one of them, Atlanta Public Schools, had a donor called Trinity Healthshare) and was/is inteded to get ""a sponsoring organization and Comcast to pay for or sponsor Internet Essentials service for eligible low-income families."" (How it Works Section, Impact Page, Comcast Corporate). The Government, in the Infrastructure Investment, and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684) is Comcast, your state (the eligible entity) is the sponsoring organization, and an unserved area is the eligible low-income family.

So, partially, they have and already had a way to do a telecom money grab or whatever if they wanted.

From How it Works Section, Impact Page, Comcast Corporate

Partnering organizations may use funding from a variety of sources to cover the cost of the service for families. In some cases, this might be through a nonprofit or school district funds, private or corporate donations, CARES Act stimulus funding, or other funding sources. Once an agreement is in place, “promo codes” are generated by Comcast, which the sponsor can then distribute to eligible families and individuals at their discretion. Promo codes are used by Comcast to bill the sponsor directly for the customer’s Internet Essentials Internet service.

But they don't have to be. This is other part of Federalism. With each State and its divisions allowed to use this money for ensuring broadband connections for more people however needed.

Division F, Title I, Section 60102 (a)

(I) Priority broadband project.--The term \`\`priority broadband project'' means a project designed to--

(i) provide broadband service that meets speed, latency, reliability, consistency in quality of service, and related criteria as the Assistant Secretary shall determine; and

(ii) ensure that the network built by the project can easily scale speeds over time to--                    (I) meet the evolving connectivity needs of households and businesses; and

(II) support the deployment of 5G, successor  wireless technologies, and other advanced services.

Contact your local reps and try to get others informed. There may be someone and something that can already inform you about how this could be spent and how locals can give input.

733,"Why are Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua relatively safe from drug trade violence?","I wouldn’t say their completely safe but they’re safer. 

  The answer in my opinion is that the countries you mentioned tend to have a more stable government, police force etc. In those countries people have more of a fear that they will be arrested and charged if they commit violence and/ or murder. 

 But let’s look at Honduras for example. It’s much more unstable and dangerous. The police there are corrupt to the point of absurdity. There are areas in Honduran cities where gangs literally have control so the police don’t bother to go in. 

 Let’s say you’re in Honduras, part of some gang and you commit a murder. You probably wouldn’t be scared because unless you’re unlucky you’re probably going to get away with it. The vast majority of cases, last I heard up to 90% are never even investigated by the police. So it’s likely no one will look into it. 


 But let’s say you’re out of luck and the police do attempt to investigate. You’re still probably going to get away with it because you as a gang member probably have the upper hand. Remember how I said lots of police are corrupt? Many are underpaid and accept money from gangs in exchange for information about raids, patrols etc. Your gang likely has cops on their payroll and can tell them to make the investigation go away for you. 

   But let’s say you’re really unlucky and you don’t have that. Still you have the upper hand. The gangs have immense power. They extort people by making them pay a “tax”. They have spies everywhere always watching and people know this. So if the cops interview people in the neighborhood there is a good chance they’ll simply refuse to talk out of fear. They don’t know if someone is watching. They don’t know that the cop isn’t on the gangs payroll. So why are they going to risk their life cooperating in an investigation they know will likely go nowhere anyway? 
 Certain neighborhoods cops don’t go into as well.
 To catch you the cops will have to overcome all of this. And this is assuming they even bother to investigate at all. 

    The difference between countries you mentioned and more violent countries like Honduras is simple. In countries like Honduras the gangs commit violence and murder with impunity because they have no fear whatsoever of being held accountable.

In those countries laws exist only on paper and are something to be laughed at"
734,How can the Build Back Better plan avoid the mistakes exemplified by the Information Superhighway?,"The information superhighway was a buzzword that was used to hype up the growth of the Internet in the 1990s.

The HPCA was the Gore bill that promoted funding for Internet technologies primarily by funding government agencies and the advancement of the Internet within those agencies. that included ARPA, and NSF and a bunch of other government agencies that would benefit from installing Internet access. 

https://i.imgur.com/MUjFvsf.jpg

I’m not aware of, nor do I think you’ll be able to find, a program in the 90s that wrote large checks to telecoms in exchange for doing nothing.

But in answer to your question, the way that we will avoid mismanagement of the funds is that we have government auditors, and that Organizations that take funds are required to provide documentation, and that for the most part the programs in build back better are government run programs already. This is just expanding things we already do, like giving people a tax credit for having kids or expanding access to pre-K.

In terms of the climate money, we already have thousands of government programs across the country designed to encourage the growth of renewable energy. they just need more funding. These programs work well and there are strict reporting requirements."
735,Can someone ELI5 about the Ethiopia situation?,"The TPLF, which is the government and military force of the rebel Tigray province, used to be the ruling party of Ethiopia itself. The previous dictator, Meles Zenawi was the commander of the TPLF when it won the civil war against the Derg government in 1991, and it continued to be his power base throughout his rule until he died in 2012.

So while much has changed in the 30 years since then, it's important to realize that this is not a ragtag bunch of rebels cobbled together in a hurry. It's a long-standing military force that has previously conquered Ethiopia.

And the opposite side of that coin is that the *rest* of Ethiopia's military (sans-TPLF) have a history of losing to the TPLF. They have more people and money, but those do not reliably translate into military superiority. And the current central government has only had 3 years in control where Tigrayans weren't the favorites to build up separate centers of power.

I think comparing the Ethiopian military to the Afghan National Army is probably terribly unfair to Ethiopia, but the ANA set an extremely low standard to exceed.

And do keep in mind that the central government *did* initially conquer Tigray's capital and looked like they had the TPLF on the ropes. The turnaround has been severe, but the TPLF did have to actually fight and win on the battlefield to pull it off.

EDIT: Zenawi died in 2012, I'd written 2018, which is when the current Prime Minister came into office. But there was a 6-year interregnum while Ethiopia's governing political coalition sorted itself out."
736,Why do states get to choose if felons/ex-felons can vote in federal elections? Shouldn't that be up to congress?,"Nope.  Per the U.S. Constitution  Article I, Section 4, Clause 1:  


>The Times, Places and **Manner** of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof;

Interestingly this gets tied in with the whole slavery debate.  Southern States didn't want the northern ones to have any say over how any one individual state selected their representatives at the national level.

Given that, there is a second half to this clause that reads:

>but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators.

How this ""balance of power"" has played out in the courts is summarized on this web page:

737,"why is there a vocal independence movement in Hong Kong, yet a push for Macanese independence is no where to be seen?","One of the biggest reasons is that Macau depends heavily on gambling and tourism as a central industry--about half of its GDP comes from this. Unsurprisingly, the majority of these tourists are from mainland China. This has created a relationship where there's much more dependence on China in Macau than exists in Hong Kong, which is more economically independent from the mainland. Hong Kong could probably survive without the Chinese; Macau probably can't. (A lot of Macau's population was born on the mainland, too.)

There are also historical dynamics that are probably too complicated to sum up here, but they can be vastly oversimplified by saying that the British probably put more of a cultural/legal/institutional imprint on HK than the Portuguese did on Macau, which made the handover to China more complicated/fraught on the HK side than on the Macau side."
738,"The DOJ is asking for the QAnon Shaman, [shirtless guy with horns], for the January 6, attack on the US Capitol, to be sentenced to a prison term of more than four years, the longest incarceration prosecutors have asked for any guilty January 6 defendant so far. Is this a a bit of an overkill?","Is the DOJ taking a violent insurrection aiming to overthrow the lawful government of the United States too seriously?  I'm gonna say no, they're doing alright on this one."
739,Just how bad was the 1993 Russian Constitutional Crisis?,"I would argue it was significantly worse than the Capitol Riots.

Boris Yeltsin dissolved the Russian Parliament who then barricaded themselves inside the White House (The Russian Parliament Building) and voted to impeach Yeltsin. Several thousand protestors rioted in Moscow.

On October 4th 1993, the electricity and water was cut off from the White House and Yeltsin ordered the army to shell the build, which they subsequently did.

In the end 187 people died (according to the Russian Government, though it is estimated to be as high as 2000.)"
740,"Do ""contested"" seats have better quality of life than ""safe seats""?","I think America would be better off with more contested seats.  But a person with a ""safe seat"" only has to win his parties approval.  Now that might mean you have to be hard core Left or Right as those voting in the parties primarily pick the winner."
741,Does Biden have the power to dismiss DOJ Garland and appoint someone else?,"The president can fire the AG for any reason as the AG serves at the pleasure of the POTUS. However, if the house thinks that this was illegal or improper, they can impeach. 

I don't think Biden has interest in speeding up already politically charged investigations, especially before re-election."
742,"How did Obama win Michigan by 17 points in 2008 (57-40)?! That's an insane margin, especially given how recent it is..","Very easily, Obama did tamper to workers, Trump did tamper to workers, Hillary didn't tamper to workers. Trump is a figure that is very able to gain a huge cult of personality.

From 2016 US. politics sphere is even more static than elections in many authoritarian states. In normal elections, parties switch voters drastically from one election to another. In Czechia for instance Social democrats went from 30% to 4% in 8 years. It isn't a suprise."
743,"In US Politics, is the Republican Party any more quick to dig up dirt on their opponents than the Democrats?","I don’t think they are any quicker but they have a massive well organized media.  They have multiple tv stations; fox, AoN new max, Sinclair and lots of AM radio shows that their people listen to.  There are daily talking points sent of by the party and they all beat the same drum.  Truth or lie say something enough and people will believe it.  The Democrats just don’t have that type of organization to their detriment."
744,How did the US Senate pass the infrastructure bill before the US House of Representatives?,"Yes, that's formally correct, but it's really horribly impractical to observe that too literally, especially in the modern era of parties where the houses just talk to each other anyway. It's be pretty dumb if the House Dems and Senate Dems do all the work together as a unit anyway but the Senate Dems can't do anything in chambers until the House is done.

So what happens is they use a simple workaround. The parties will draft legislation and answer all these questions, then go back to their houses and work on passing it. But in the Senate they just will only talk about the policy (we'll spend 100 mil on this bridge, for example)  while in the House they'll also talk about how they'll fund it (we'll spend 100 mil on this bridge and offset that by a tax on melons). Then, whoever gets it passed first, great! If it's the House, then they just kill off the bill currently being proposed in the Senate and instead start discussing the bill sent over from the House (which is the same damn thing). If the Senate passes it first, the House kills the bill they were talking about, talks about the Senate one instead, and adds all the funding stuff they were already talking about anyway. It passes, gets sent back to the Senate, but since everyone already had discussed the tax stuff when they passed it the first time, then it should easily pass.

Basically, it's only important to be super rigid with that rule if the only time the bills are ever discussed is in formal legislative chambers. But obviously that's not the case. Well before the official bill is drafted, everyone already knows what the bill will look like because it's their job. It's mostly just a procedural technicality. That does not mean it's useless, but it does mean that the actual real life version of how the job is done means that we've developed effective work arounds."
745,Are political opinions distributed in a bell shaped curve?,"This is a very complicated question and a lot of early political science works to answer this. The most direct answer to this is the Median Voter Theorem (MVT). MVT assumes that yes, political perspectives are set in a bell curve and therefore the party that can more effectively move to the center has an electoral advantage. At first blush, this theory seems to be pretty reliable considering how often politicians move away from the extremes and toward the center. But it has a few flaws.

Most notably, it's almost impossible to boil down all political thought to a single point on a number line. Imagine a line 0-10. How does this model perform if someone identifies as a, say 6 or 7 but votes exclusively based on an issue where they are an 8? Or what if they are a 4 in one election but then the issues change and they become a 6 or a 3? And when we see parties instead move away from the center, does that imply the model is wrong about predictive behavior or wrong about the way the spectrum looks?

Put another way, consider Donald Stokes' idea of valence issues. He says that there are some issues where there isn't really position difference, just a different evaluation of HOW each party will accomplish the agreed upon goal. In this understanding, there's no party that wants a bad economy. They all want a good one. So this isn't about position on an issue, but rather about how well voters believe a particular party will accomplish that issue. This of course undermines the idea of rational, position-on-a-line based thinking that we see from MVT or a more Anthony Downs kind of rationalism.

Some have suggested that the MVT is broadly speaking hitting on something valuable, even if we need to rethink certain parts of it. For example, maybe there's a ""double-peaked"" curve in the electorate. But that doesn't really explain why sometimes parties go to the middle and sometimes they don't. Basically, no matter how you slice it, voters are somewhat unpredictable and their choices are complex, involving moving and often contradictory parts fitting together in a weird party identification.

There isn't really a set yes or no. The conventional wisdom that the spectrum mostly looks like a bell curve probably isn't wrong most of the time. At the very least, we can probably agree that a bell curve is the healthiest way for your political system to look, and your structures absolutely can influence how that spectrum develops. When it's not looking like that, is it because your structures are bad or because your political system is shifting as it naturally does every so often? Hard to say while it's in progress."
746,Why are people bothered by social security not being around for younger generations?,"I did a quick scan of your posting history and have concluded you are American or at least you live in America. Therefore I have to assume you know what Social Security actually is.

So if you earn wages or a salary, you must have noticed something called FICA deducted from your pay. This goes to fund Social Security. The idea is that if you qualify for benefits, you will get benefits paid through others' FICA deductions. Of course many people qualify for Social Security due to disability, however your subject line would seem to pertain primarily to those who qualify due to old age.

So why people are bothered is that they find it obscenely unfair that part of their hard-earned income is taken away from them to benefit others over a certain age, but then when they reach that age themselves there won't be any benefits for them because the Trust Fund will have been drained. Especially as those currently receiving the benefit belong to a generation largely blamed for the fact that the Trust Fund is likely to be drained by then, by having brought about societal conditions that make it hard for people your age to earn a comfortable income and save for retirement."
747,Why isn’t Russia held accountable for their actions during the Soviet era?,It’s a perk of having nuclear weaponry: nobody will really do anything to you. They also have a lot of energy production that Europe needs.
748,Why democracy never worked in Russia?,"Francis Fukuyama's definition is pretty good: Rule of law, democratic accountability and well-working institutions are the pillars of an actual democracy. 

Achieving this is not easy by any means. I don't have a good answer to your question, but trying to understand the problem from these 3 pillars is interesting, I think."
749,Why does congress try to pass these huge bills with lots of small parts (like the BBB plan) instead of doing a lot of small bills?,"No. There’s so much gridlock in congress that really only a certain bill can be passed because a 60 person vote in the senate is basically impossible. A budget reconciliation bill only needs a simple majority to pass, so the democrats with 50 members plus VP can pass that sort of bill. Since you only get 3 reconciliation bills per year that means the party with the majority has to cram as much into the bill as possible. In this current environment, no simple clean bill with “popular” provisions will ever pass."
750,Is disempowerment of minorities inherent to democracy?,"I think the underlying assumption in this question is that autocracies would somehow be better. We know autocracies are often controlled by elite groups. They oppress the masses and minorities, often worse than democracies."
751,Where can I start to learn about politics?,"Before you learn about politics, learn about how the government operates. Learn about the structure of government(federal, state, and local.) Learn about how elections works. Learn about how laws are made. Learn about how legislature  in your state works."
752,What exactly is revolving door politics and how does it work?,"1. Politician gets elected to office (say, the House of Representatives)

2. Politician has a long political career, all the while making contacts with lobbyists, other officeholders, government contractors and other partners.

3. Politician eventually leaves office (retirement, voted out, scandal, etc), and is offered a job by a lobbying outfit.

4. Politician returns to the halls of Congress and legislatures as a lobbyist, gaining access to officials via their business and personal connections, and influencing public policy to the benefits of their clients.

The bad aspect of this is the potential for making corruption easier. That being said, some categories of lobbyists are required to register with governments."
753,Income vs sales tax. Why have both? Do they do different things?,"In the US, the federal government primarily taxes income whilst sales taxes are a major revenue source for subnational governments (along with property taxes). Income taxes are generally unpopular, so few states levy them."
754,What is Gain of Function and how do you make sense of the latest Fauci controversy about Wuhan,"Pretty sure it's noise. The main controversy seems to be over how ""gain of function"" is defined in a research setting. Fauci seems to be on the side that gain of function only applies to viruses that CAN infect humans, while many on the right think ANY manipulation of viruses to gain function qualifies.

https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/scicheck-republicans-spin-nih-letter-about-coronavirus-gain-of-function-research/

In the end, it's noise and doesn't make a big difference. This research is pretty widespread, and it's not like even if the US did fund the research we were hoping to release the coronavirus. It's finger-pointing which doesn't help us move forward."
755,What is the substantive difference between Libertarianism and Anarchism?,"Anarchism does not recognize nor support hierarchical structure. There is only cooperative interactions to achieve common goals. Anarchists are distrustful of ruling class outcomes that lead to corruption and abuse to maintain power. They do not embrace chaos although that is the way most people see it. Libertarians just think other than government and crime prevention government should have no say in anyone's life. While there is something to be said for both philosophies I find them both unwilling to recognize the realities of living in a modern society. The complexity of our problems cannot be solved at a local level or fixed by free market outcomes. That said there should be limiting factors to prevent despotism withn a strong independent  judicial system.  Term limits for office. Honest elections and oversite to see that money or existing power does not corrupt them and a healthy , safe 4th estate"
756,Why do people have a selective outrage when it comes to government spending?,">We spend about 2.5 billion a year on federal, state, and local welfare in the USA (not including social security and medicare)

This is just ridiculously untrue. The federal government *alone* spent $773 billion on means-tested aid programs in 2019. That includes $65 billion *just* on SNAP (food stamps). Where in the world did you get the idea that it was just $2.5 billion per year?

757,"Why didn't Bill Clinton suffer any ""real"" punishments for committing perjury?","It's largely because of *what* he committed perjury *about*. He was convicted of lying...about having an affair. That has absolutely nothing to with the job of president. There is nothing in the Constitution about the job being a ""role model"" or ""moral figure"" and certainly nothing about enforcing that concept as a matter of law. 

It's already legally/procedurally difficult to charge the president with a crime, but when that crime *doesn't actually matter* even less so. Clinton lied about a personal thing that 99% of people would lie about in that position. Do you want to go after him for lying about what he ate for breakfast, too?

It's a crime of technicality. That's how literally everyone who has authority in the matter sees it and no one wants to push that envelope."
758,Why do so many political issues revolve around schools?,It's also an obvious extension of fear mongering politics. Make already stressed out parents scared of what's going on in schools and out of emotional poor decisions; individuals can manipulate the emotional group to achieve whatever.
759,What are the alternatives to party politics?,"Political parties are inherent in all democratic systems. The only way to escape them is to get rid of democracy.


Political parties will alway form around any sort of elective method for deciding government power because people will naturally organize and create infrastructure to help elect people who will to push common interests."
760,Why are businesses taxed on profits where workers are taxed on income?,"Profit is income, revenue is not. Iff a business pays 100 dollars to get 110 dollars of revenue then they only made 20 bucks.

768,Why is it almost impossible to remove a president/government in the US compared to most european countries where no-confidence votes are successful all the time?,"The US presidential system functions differently from a parliamentary system.  


In a parliamentary system the legislative and executive branches are intertwined together. The majority party in the legislature chooses a prime minister who then goes onto form and lead a government. When a no-confidence vote is passed in the legislature it ends the mandate that the current government has to rule and typically triggers a general election. Whatever party that emerges with a majority from the election can then go onto to form a new government.   


In a Presidential system the legislature and executive branches are elected separately. Votes of no-confidence don't exist in the US Presidential system since the legislature isn't involved in the selection of the President. When a President is removed or chooses to leave office an election isn't called to replace them either. In that situation the Vice-President who is next in line would step up and take over the position. Impeachment is thus not an effective way to remove a party immediately from power.   


In the US system the only way to remove a sitting President is through being convicted during the impeachment process. Constitutionally the power of impeachment is reserved for situations involving ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors"" which sets a very high bar for it's use. If impeachment proceedings are started the US Constitution also requires a 2/3rd's vote in the Senate for conviction which makes it even more difficult to use successfully. The conduct of a President essentially has to be egregious and upset even members of their own party for them to be convicted and ultimately removed from office."
769,Has Anyone Done Work Calculating The Optimal Size Of A Multi-Seat District?,"Multi member districts are not fully proportional. They’re better than FPTP, but can and do still less to non-proportional outcomes. In the context of the US, I suppose this would probably have to be worked out by looking at the state with the lowest population and using that as a baseline for how many people should be in a multi-member electorate. That’s Wyoming which means a district can’t have a larger population than around 564,000. You could also go smaller and split that up, but by that point you’re expanding the House by a huge number which would not be popular."
770,Are political parties inevitable in a democratic system?,"Long story short, yes, political parties are inevitable because they are really helpful to voters.

The problem with politics is that there are like a million different things politicians deal with that are completely unrelated to each other and learning about them in detail takes an enormous amount of time and energy. If you're a normal person who has a job and responsibilities and kids and whatever else, you simply don't have the resources to keep yourself informed on those issues in great amounts of detail. 

Imagine if you had to approach every issue with zero context. You'd have to vet the ideas of every candidate every time. When the guy you like retires, how would you know who's most similar to him without parties? Imagine if you're thinking about president and you have no way of knowing that Obama and Clinton shared most of their policies without reading the details of their platform or listening to a great many of their speeches/interviews/etc until they addressed all the issues you cared about. See the problem? 

It gets worse when you really think about it from a candidate perspective. I live in NYC. Mayor voting starts now, along with a whole bunch of local races. But there are like 10 or so JUST local elected officials I have to learn about. Should I learn every single candidate's platform for every single race? That's just not reasonable, especially considering a lot of that information will be redundant.

Plus, a good part of our democratic functions depend on getting a large group of like minded voters. That's the whole point of a legislature. That means that by definition it makes sense for guys that are mostly aligned to coordinate together to communicate their policies and pool their votes. And that's basically just a very basic description of a political party.

In short, political parties are both super useful to voters and the most natural and obvious vehicle to actually reach your political goals. There's not much else to it. There's no real way to avoid political parties nor should you try because they are objectively provide more good than bad.

A really big note that parties do not require extreme partisanship. If your system is well designed, then parties actually DECREASE the partisanship of your system. Modern, effective democracies use parties as a feature, not a bug."

773,What are the ideological forces that compete for people's attention in the Arab Middle East Muslim world?," Well the thing to understand about the Middle East is that there is multiple storylines going on at once. The Sunni- Shia thing, moderate Islam v Islamism are going on at once and often intersect. 

 It is absolutely true in the Middle East that the Sunni/ Shia conflict is partly based on religion. The two are denominations of Islam and have different beliefs. I’m not sure about those ask someone more familiar. But basically Sunni extremists say the Shia are not Muslim and vice versa. 

  But if you look closer then you can see this conflict is more about geopolitics. It’s not a conflict of “an hatreds.” It’s true that sectarian wars have happened but the same happened in Europe with Catholic v Protestant. But in many cases more than you’d think the two groups actually managed to live together like Catholics and Protestants did. 

  But 1978 changed this. In Iran prior to 1978 a very cruel secular leader ruled a traditional Shia Muslim Iran. Remember that. This ushered in a theocratic Shia Muslim government. This revolution actually was inspiring to many across the ME to Muslims Sunni or Shia. The Shia thing didn’t really matter. It was more seen as Muslims overthrowing a cruel western backed government. But Iran then began trying to export this revolutionary ideology abroad. 
  This alarmed Saudi Arabia which felt Iran was trying to gain influence over it. They were afraid of being crowded out by Iran. They can’t really give people that as a reason as it’s pretty cold. So they emphasize the Sunni- Shia thing. And Iran did in turn. 


 Think about it like this. Saudi Arabia is merely exploiting the fact that Iran is Shia. They know if they can convince Sunnis across the ME to hate Shias then they’re less likely to side with a country that is majority Shia. Iran plays the game too. They like to portray themselves as protectors of Shiites. It’s really that cynical. In an alternate universe where SA is Shia and Iran is Sunni they’d still likely exploit it. 

 It is logical but morally repugnant as it incites violence. 

  Moderate v radical Islam? Well that’s more of a culture war that the ME is going through. There is a debate over what role Islam should play in society and politics. There’s a fierce debate about separation of church and state or in this case mosque and state? 

 What you have to understand is that they’re going through something Christian Europe has gone through. It’s not pretty. But this doesn’t mean it’s because Islam is inherently evil. Societies go through this."

776,I have heard that Russia is becoming more and more financially owned by China - is this true?,"China is Russia's single largest trade partner, comprising about 16% of Russia's trade overall. Russia, on the other hand, accounts for .8% of China's trade. This is a simple imbalance. Looking into the numbers further, the reason some might say China OWNS Russia is because the imbalance doesn't just extend to trade volume, but diversity. Russia exports natural resources and some weaponry to China. But China exports a wider array of advanced technology, machinery, microelectronics, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, etcetera, to Russia. Russia is dependent on Chinese imports, yet China is not dependent on Russian imports. Sanctions and Russia's self-imposed economic isolation has only made this problem worse. This is part of the reason for why people say China essentially owns Russia.

777,"What are the pros and cons of a western government enacting Pirate Party type policies, considering that China is a huge patent thief and stem server snoop?","Speaking from the POV of a software engineer, free software advocate, and a startup CTO; my opinions are my own.

The idea behind patents is actually to encourage inventors to open up their inventions / trade secrets / other forms of IP and put them into some sort of a publicly-owned escrow, so that they can eventually become public domain / a commodity, instead of dying with the inventor. When you file for a patent, your secret basically already becomes public knowledge. In return, if the patent is granted, it provides the inventor with certain protections - the idea is you shouldn't be at a net loss versus trying to keep the secret to yourself.

My opinion is that the patent system (especially as it extends to cover software, which is on my opinion just fancy math) is, and has been since its inception, doing more harm than good to the general public. Few ""inventions"" that are granted patents are actually genuinely original; rather, corporations tend to weaponize them to stifle competition (for example: [Microsoft's patent on the FAT file system](https://wiki.endsoftwarepatents.org/wiki/Microsoft_FAT_patents), which makes it practically impossible for devices to present themselves as storage to the most common operating systems). More power to those in power, less for those who must play by the rules.

The status quo is China in general [already has very little respect for any forms of intellectual property protection](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2119935/counterfeiting--faked-in-china.html); many of us also have anecdotes to share about a $50 five-star gizmo from Amazon that turned out as a dud - these are often ""night shift"" runs in factories that will produce an entire chip, board, or maybe even the final product, but say don't burn in a serial number, or skip flashing the firmware.

I would expect the immediate impact of a far-reaching patent reform to firstly and mostly hit the western megacorps, followed by their (current or potential) licensees. The effects would be interesting to watch unfold, but (in my hope), ultimately positive to the society. Chinese companies would lose one of their myriad ways to access and copy ideas and designs, but since manufacturing often happens there anyway, and since their reverse-engineering talent pool is both tremendously resourceful and already hard at work - I don't think they're going to notice in the long run.

As for my company? We've always been backend-first, so all of our secret sauce is running on our servers, which makes it significantly more complicated to steal. Perhaps one or two of our solutions are patentable, but I don't really care - one thing we've done was copied (and/or independently discovered) by AWS, another by a different, smaller company. We don't care because our solutions address the needs of the market, and it's never about the idea alone, but about the execution."

This is a very circumstantial question because of the way you've phrased it. If the high-profile action has (or is perceived to have) a net benefit, then one could argue to Overton Window would expand. I'd argue that Bernie Sanders did just this with his campaign (or that he at least gave a voice to existing values).

However, if the high-profile action has (or is perceived to have) a net detriment to society, then moderates will likely recoil from those values. Regardless of anyone's thoughts or opinions on the movements themselves, no moderate likes it when riots happen, either due to a perceived stolen election or as a result of BLM protesting."

You could always print your letter and send it the old fashioned way. Or call the office directly and ask your question/share your opinion.

Note: If you are not a constituent/resident of their district, the member/staff will likely not give your opinion much weight. Congresspeople are there to represent the members of their district and have a lot of casework to do as it is. 

If you have a genuine question and call, they might be nice and answer it. But if you’re trying to give political input (“Vote for that,” “oppose this bill”) they’ll probably listen politely and then forget about you the moment the call ends. Not out of rudeness, they’re just doing their jobs.

And as I said, young people here are right wing so they would rather vote for a right-wing party like SPOLU that won the elections or Pirates coalition partner STAN that looked much more centrist. 

And on the other side, from ''left wing'' older people, those people were seen as anarchist and mainly, elitist. Pirate party was doomed to fail and it was pretty clear before the elections but no-one did see that. Because most people here in Czech Republic truly thinked that it's in Czechia same as in US. and that young people are left-leaning after all, which was a lie and we saw that in elections. 

So Pirates were seen to leftist by young demographic, to elitist by old demographic and too obscure by they're programm that the doom was imminent, people just didn't saw that comin."
786,How valid are the criticisms of the Majority Leader’s comments after the debt ceiling vote?,[removed]
787,How worried should I be if the Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling and the USA defaults?,"Yeah, if it happened, I'd be very worried.  Our credit rating would immediately drop, and may still anyway if the games continue in December.  T Bonds would no longer be the ultra secure investment they were the day before the default and would have to return significantly higher interest to be attractive.  The added borrowing cost would be passed on to the public through an immediate jump in the prime rate, and interest rates across the country would balloon.  Low interest rates are propping up the hyperinflated housing market and the shock will probably lead to another collapse of the housing market followed by deflation so your $400k house will be $200k by next Christmas, and you will probably see a new wave of foreclosures starting with landlords and commercial property.  You won't be able to capitalize on this however because if you have a 790 credit score the lowest interest rate available will still be 11.75%.  Meanwhile when the world sees that the US no longer pays back what it borrowed they will lose faith in the dollar as a reserve currency and will switch to the Euro or the RMB.  The cost of gas when the dollar is no longer used as the currency for all oil transactions will now be subject to the exchange rate, and with the dollar already in a tail spin gas will rise to $9 a gallon.  The price will be transferred as hyperinflation to the consumer who will not be able to afford it anyways,  and the economy collapses.  On the plus side the Republicans can capitalize and take back congress in 22, and all it took was burning the country to the ground.  Or the money men could decide the points don't count and the rules are made up anyway and we carry on as normal..."
788,Did Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug policy work?,">Has anyone checked whether people in the Phillipines have stopped abusing drugs?

The objective of any drug campaign is to *suppress* use.  There will always be drug use and crime; there is never a complete stop.  Link: [Countries with the harshest drug penalties -- Punishments vary from lashings to life imprisonment or even death](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/countries-harshest-drug-penalties-world-a7425851.html). Nations with strict policies almost never kill thousands of  users, like Duterte, but such action is not unprecedented.  [NY Times 2003 article](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/world/a-wave-of-drug-killings-is-linked-to-thai-police.html):

>An extraordinary campaign of government-approved killings is under way in Thailand -- a crackdown on drug dealers that has taken as many as 2,000 lives over the past two months....

Nations with strict drug policies  or that engage in such violence have lower rates of drug use.  An important metric from  the  UN's Office on Drugs and Crime:  [Annual prevalence of drug use](https://dataunodc.un.org/drugs/prevalence_table-2017) -- the total percent of a nation that is using drugs.  You can look nation by nation to see drug use levels. 

>I commented at the time that if it doesn't work, then it suggests the War on Drugs is doomed to fail.

Yes, many drug policy reformers and social scientists assert that drug laws do little to deter use.  Some advocates want all drugs legalized and offer this view, paraphrasing:

>""The War on Drugs has been  a failure.  It hardly deterred any drug use.   Most everyone who wants drugs has been getting them. If all drugs are legalized and sold over the counter like alcohol, use will only rise a bit. Let everyone access drugs, we can rehab any addicts.”

These advocates correctly point out that drug laws do little to deter addicts.  Most supporters of drug enforcement take a different perspective: Dealing with addicts, be it treatment or incarceration, is a sideshow.  Primary objective: Reducing the *total number* of users, which includes many recreational users. (FN) 

From this perspective, a nation with 14% of its population using that reduces that figure to 9% is better off.   It will have far fewer addicts.   And 5% is better than 9%.  According to the World Health Organization, the U.S. has the  [highest rate of drug use in the world.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-leads-the-world-in-illegal-drug-use/) 

Yes, the article writes: ""Despite tough anti-drug laws, a new survey shows the U.S. has the highest level...""  The perspective of drug enforcers is that without some enforcement...if drugs distribution of some sort is allowed, drug use would be far higher.  America has a big appetite for drugs, in part because a lot of people support or promote drug use (below).


= = = 



FN:  Drug policy reformer [Carl Hart recently offered the interesting opinion](https://old.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/ls2l9v/discussion_university_professor_suggests_70_of/) that 70% of all hard drug users *do not* have an addiction problem.  This view runs counter to the anti-drug demonization of drug enforcers--they loosely suggest that 70-90% of all hard drug users develop major problems (FN2)--but reality is that drug enforcers always understood there were tons of people using hard drugs casually.  Hart's figure might be a bit high, but he is a largely right.

This initially might seem to **support** the case for legalizing all drugs, but it is the opposite.  A perception of minimal danger leads far more people to try drugs.  Hart's comments on his drug use:  “I discovered  the predominant effects... are positive...didn’t matter whether the drug was cannabis, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine..."" inspires these sorts of views:

""Carl Hart says meth and heroin are not so addictive.  I'll chance them.""  (This is not to single Hart out as an extremist; more and more drug policy reformers now support people's rights to use hard drugs.)

Drug enforcers see importance in suppressing drug experimentation and casual use.   Some portion of recreational users of hard drugs will always become addicted. Even a 30% *failure rate* for hard drug use (derived from Hart's 70% figure) is seen as a major problem. 

Drug enforcers see non-addicts as much more ""deterrable.""  People with homes and mortgages and years spent in higher education or complex job training generally want to keep their careers going.  They are susceptible to threats of job loss via drug testing or prison for drugs.  *Again, drug policy reformers disagree, persistently challenging the value of deterrence.* [example](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/crime-and-punishment/201804/why-punishment-doesnt-reduce-crime)

789,"McConnell is concerned about pressure on two democrat senators, how? why?",">What kind of pressure would Manchin and Sinema would face? How does ""pressure"" manifest itself? What does ""pressure"" looks like from the perspective of a senator?

Senators Manchin and Sinema have been under constant pressure for months to abolish (or at least create carve outs for) the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation, infrastructure and social safety net bills, and more. This has come in the form of [op-eds](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/manchin-s-filibuster-defense-contradicts-senate-legacy-he-claims-protect-ncna1263770), [President Biden](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-filibuster-voting-rights-corruption-manchin-sinema-1224269/), [third-party groups](https://news.yahoo.com/left-wing-group-launches-call-170000305.html), and fellow [Democratic senators](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-agenda-sanders-manchin-senate-democrats/2021/10/06/96fdee98-26e3-11ec-a6ad-9ee7deda7f34_story.html). All these examples are for Manchin, but there are ample articles on pressuring Sinema as well.

>Why would the two senators succumb to pressure from other congresspeople if they only answer to the people of their own state?

Senators depend on the support of their constituencies to keep their jobs, true, but they also rely on their colleagues in the Senate to do their jobs. Want to be on a particular committee? Want the chairman of a committee to advance your bill to the floor? Want the Senate Majority Leader to bring your bill up for a vote? Want your colleagues to cosponsor your legislation? Want to be blamed for sinking the Democratic Party's agenda and undermining your party's leadership, including the president? If you have no friends in your workplace, your job becomes a lot harder.

>How exactly is McConnell relieving pressure by allowing short term increase?

McConnell wants to preserve the filibuster, and the pressure on Manchin and Sinema has been immense. McConnell wants to avoid any situation that might change their calculus on the filibuster. If the pressure gets too great and they decide to change position on the filibuster (e.g. creating carveouts or nuking it entirely), McConnell suddenly has zero power, and Democrats can pass whatever legislation they want so long as they can get their caucus to support it.

The debt ceiling is a huge deal, and the Republicans are being hypocritical about it, conducting a dangerous sort of brinkmanship that would utterly destroy the American economy as we know it. McConnell flinched and organized members of his party to temporarily suspend the debt limit in order to avoid what he sees would spell doom for Republican obstruction: Manchin and Sinema changing their position on the filibuster to avoid catastrophic financial default. 

His move was a pressure valve that, at least on this issue, relieved pressure from the two Democratic senators.

>Is McConnell only postponing the inevitable?

The debt limit suspension is temporary. We'll be back in this same spot come December. But for now, McConnell's Republicans and the filibuster live to fight another day."
790,Why did Eugene McCarthy Endorse Reagan in 1980?,"I think this is a good example of just how unpopular Jimmy Carter was. Carter was seen as a terrible candidate right from the beginning, but the primary process at the time tended to favor ideological favorites rather than electability. Carter won his initial term because he was running against Gerald Ford in the first race after Watergate--literally any Dem could have won that race.

So in a way, 1980 was Carter's first ""real"" political race. And his defeat was so bad that the Dems created the Hunt Commission to reform the primary process and get better candidates than Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, and Jimmy Carter, all of whom got absolutely CRUSHED in a national race. 

McCarthy, as you point out, should have been someone who voted against Reagan. Instead, he became a supporter. This was an era of poor political process for the Dems as they sought their new identity in the post-Southern conservative core. In many ways, it wasn't until Bill Clinton won a competitive national race without the core of Southern conservatives that the Dems found their current identity."
791,"Since Republicans must be present under reconciliation rules in order to constitute a quorum, is it actually true Democrats can lift the debt ceiling all on their own?","Congress can compel members to attend, including sending the Sergeant at Arms to physically detain Senators and/or Representatives and bring them to Congress to make a quorum. The only time this has been done in practice was performative. The Representative walked up to the doors of Congress, then made the Sergeant at Arms carry him into the room as a publicity stunt to show disapproval of the bill on the floor. However, if Republicans were to stage a walk out or try to deny a quorum the Democrats would have the power to compel their attendance. This power to compel attendance is precisely why neither political party tries to deny quorum as a political tool."

793,How effective are citizen initiatives?,"These occur at state and local levels and the rules for them vary by state and locality.

In the state of Ohio, the requirements to get in the ballot are significant. It takes money to get it done. Therefore the vast majority of the ballot issues that even get in the ballot are ones supported by powerful groups. Then to win support in the election to approve the issue, it takes more money.

This means that the ones that win have big financial support from large organizations. This means that the process is terrible in most places and does not achieve the goals set forth.

At local levels (cities) there can be more success as the scope is not as large as a state, but the same problem of money exists during the election. If the issue would affect one group positively or negatively, then if that group has money, they can make a big difference with buying campaign adds for or against it.

Direct democracy sucks. Representative Democracy is the best type of system. The problem with American politics is apathy and ignorance.

They vote for whoever they think gives them the best chance but they don't then become a ""follower"" of that person. Everyday survival there is a bigger challenge than in the affluent West. Refusing to think like an adult, and refusing to accept obvious truths whether pretty or not, are not good survival strategies."
796,What is the feedback loop in judicial systems and law enforcement?,"In all systems the feedback is provided by choice. Like price doesn’t matter if you can’t choose not to buy. Which is why healthcare (in the us) is so expensive. 

Elections are another form of choice. Slower than most purchases elections happen every 2/4 years. And some judges are elected directly. Most are appointed by the people we elect every 2/4 years.

So who I vote for mayor will eventually trickle down to who gets hired or held by the police chief. Who can get replaced every election or stay on for multiple terms or even multiple mayors."
797,Why Chinese and Russians are so fond of their governments?,"People in China have gone from the Middle Ages to a Modern developed country in the span of a few decades. By any standard, this is a great feat, and it is normal that Chinese citizens are vouching for the party that led them through that development.

Chinese people also know their history, and they have a cyclical conception of it. Two of their biggest fears is foreign influence, like in the Opium wars or Mongolian invasions, and instability, like during the Warring Kingdoms or the XXth Century civil war. Both evils feed each other and a strong central government is seen as a safeguard against this.

What we see as a terrible repressive regime is seen by Chinese people as a necessary sacrifice for peace, stability and prosperity. And you know what ? It kind of worked. 

On the Russian side, the 1990s were a traumatic period, and Putin also came with a promise of stabilizing the country’s failing social structures. People in Russia also felt threatened by NATO. You can understand them : they had embraced capitalism at great cost, the USSR had collapsed… only for NATO to expand its alliance against Russia. Plus, they had Yeltsin witnessing all this drunk, making a fool of himself while people were struggling to make a living.

So Putin came in as a strong leader giving a sense of USSRstalgic pride to the people of Russia. They had suffered so much that it felt safer with a leader such as him. It’s hard to blame them for that.

What seems harsh for Westerners is nothing compared to what people had to go through in the 1990s. 

Still, there is more opposition to Putin than there is against the CCP in mainland China, but it hasn’t organized into a significant response for the moment. 

There is an old saying that states there are only two ways to leave the Kremlin : either in glass casket or in a closed casket. Russia is not a country, it’s an empire, and a hard one to govern. Having a strong man in power is often seen as a solution to this problem."
798,Are SCOTUS members also in charge of various Federal Appeals Court? O has no one yet been appointed to the New York Federal Appeals Court and Sotomayor is filling in?,"Responsibility for handling emergency appeals to the Supreme Court is divided among the 9 Supreme Court Justices.  Sotamayor is responsible for handling emergency appeals from the [2nd Circuit](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/circuitassignments.aspx) which includes the states of New York, Vermont, and Connecticut.

The teachers in New York have been attempting to get an injunction against enforcement of the mandate while the issue was still being litigated. They have so far had their arguments rejected by a Federal Judge as well as the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals which prompted them to make an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court as a last ditch effort. Since Sotamayor handles emergency appeals from cases originating in the 2nd Circuit and the case was based out of New York she was assigned to deal with the issue."
799,Can Arab Israelis start a West Bank settlement and demand Israel's support?,"This area of Isreali law is intentionally ambiguous so the TLDR answer is a court will have to decide.

Broadly speaking, under Israeli civil law, the state is supposed to treat all of its citizens as equal. However, the Israeli Legal system has some major exceptions that weaken ""non-discrimination"" as a broader principle. These include the Law of Return which only applies to Jews and the Law of Absentee Property which effectively allows Jews to appropriate property left by Arab who fled Palestine in 48'. For this reason, while the idea of ""equality under the law"" is part of Israel's legal system, it is considered far more tenuous than in most ""liberal democracies""

The legal situation in the West Bank settlements is even more complicated. Israel applies Civil Law in the settlements, but it does not claim the settlements to be within Israel, meaning they are in a situation of Israeli civil law both applying and not applying at the same time. The area surrounding the Settlements (with the exception of the Hebron settlements) is governed by Israeli military law, which is sometimes applied in the settlements when there is a security issue.

There is no actual legal mechanism for ""officially"" establishing a settlement. All settlements began in a legal grey area, where it is not clear whether civil or military law applies. No court has ever stopped the IDF from clearing a new settlement, and it doesn't usually have to give a very clear reason.

So precedent suggests the IDF can stop any Israeli it wants from creating a settlement, without supplying a reason. A suit could be filed saying that violates ""equality under the law"" but the IDF would argue it's not bound by ""equality under the law"" if there is a security concern."

801,Can gerrymandering be solved in a more stable fashion mathematically?,"The thing is - you still need humans to make decisions as to how to program the AI.


For example, let’s say you have a hypothetical state that is square in shape and has 2 counties, one in the top half and one in the bottom half. The top half county is mostly democrats. The bottom half county is mostly republican. And this state needs 2 districts.


Do you program the AI to maximize competitiveness by splitting the state in half from top to bottom? So that in each district there will be dems competing with republicans. Or do you program the AI to keep counties together by splitting the state in half from left to right exactly as the counties are defined? Which will end up giving dems one seat and republicans one seat?


Now complicate that by saying the state is in the shape of an upright triangle and there are three counties with a denser population in the top half and a sparser population in the bottom half. Does the AI maximize competitiveness? Or preserving counties? Or making sure district borders are as short as possible? 


My point is AI is helpful but is still highly dependent on humans decisions.


(Besides, Skynet will probably determine that the best possible outcome is to scrap elections and have an AI run dictatorship)"
802,What is the fiscal economic legacy of Margaret Thatcher,"You can both be somewhat right. Thatcher won office during a period of high economic and social instability, and during a time when state-directed development seemed to be failing across the continent as an economic model. She succeeded in the goals of reducing inflation and generating higher growth rates in national GDP, but the cost of dismantling and privatising less profitable state enterprises did result in job losses, and higher unemployment. [Source](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22070491)

Thatcher is credited sometimes with the 'financialisation' of the UK economy, and making London the financial centre of Europe, but the benefits (present and future) of that have been eroded significantly by the Brexit project (as instruments of capital have moved out of the capital for the continent). 

One can make a case (as your friend might) that a hypothetical rival Labour government could have led the UK to complete economic collapse, and that Thatcher's strong hand saved the economy and the union (for a time). One can also make the case that her policies were needlessly cruel, and that other countries managed the transition better, and preserved more institutions clearly beneficial to the public."
803,What do anarchists even want? What does that society look like?,"The problem with your question is what a self proclaimed anarchist would define as being an anarchist. The term itself has a varied set of concepts, many of which are contradictory."
804,How will the ~$3.5T Build Back Better / budget reconciliation bill be paid for?,"There are a number of ""pay-fors"" within the Build Back Better Act/reconciliation package. Some of them involve tweaks to the tax code (e.g., clawing back some of the Trump tax cuts that largely benefitted the wealthy; raising corporate tax rates, etc.). Others involve allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices (allowing the government to put the money to use elsewhere) or adding teeth to various enforcement mechanisms (e.g., allowing the Department of Labor to sue insurance companies for violating the Mental Health and Addiction Parity Act).

That being said, nothing is set in stone yet. The House went through the effort of marking up many of these details, but Senators Manchin and Sinema have long been opposed to the $3.5 trillion number and negotiations are ongoing. President Biden visited House Democrats on Friday to try to get everyone in line and to find consensus on a new, lower number (rumored to be between $1.9 and $2.5 trillion).

A few groups have tried to do the math on the individual tax provisions that came out of the House Ways and Means Committee, but these are more or less an academic exercise until the House and Senate can get on the same page and hammer out a deal."
805,Why is the Paris Agreement voluntary?,"I'll answer your question with another question: what governing body?

Each country has their own. Some are quite powerful of course. But whichever country you live in, is there widespread political agreement to act seriously on climate change? In my country, the United States, there is not. If our governing body just here in the US can't find the political will, what international governing body can?"
806,What happened to Greece? Why isn't it a tourist powerhouse?,"I think this is probably a much larger question than just tourist power. 

But the shortest answer to it - it is a major tourist destination. In fact, per capita, it's one of the most visited countries per capita in the world, especially once you strip out the outliers of countries with tiny populations (Iceland, Malta, Bahamas, etc). 

Though I think a lot of that tourism likely differs from what you're imagining. People come en masse to head to the beaches of the Greek isles and some of the sugar cube villages on them. I think the core to your question is why aren't people swarming to see all of the ancient temples and agoras - and the short of that is that there isn't much left. And what is left isn't as grand as you might imagine. The Parthenon and the rest of the Acropolis structures are a huge draw - and one of those things that you can't really go to Athens and miss. But unless you're particularly interested in Greek antiquities, it's effectively a quick photo stop or maybe even a longer stop at the museum attached. And while again, if you're a great student of history, some of the other sites may be interesting, it'll be more or less of the same elsewhere. 

As for preservation or just a general sense of the ""more"", as you continue your studies on Greek history, you'll find that there is a huge gap between the powerhouse of ancient Athens and today, in which Athens and much of Greece (taking various turns in time) spent over a millennium in strife - war, occupation, subjugation, in fighting, more war, etc. Even moreso than Italy (in which the whole history of 'Italy' as a united entity is relatively new, Italy at least had rather long-standing competing now-constituent entities  that enjoyed a great deal of stability and power to build on), most of Greek history was pretty brutal - something that the Greeks carry with great resolve in their history books but doesn't often make its way into most average school books abroad, despite how heavily their ancient history is emphasised abroad. Athens itself, for example, was largely abandoned when the Greek Kingdom was established in the 1930s and it was chosen as the new capital city - basically just 4000 or so people living in pretty run down villages at the base of the acropolis. As for why they didn't preserve all of the ancient buildings better, well during times of division and war and occupation, that's not really top of mind for most people - especially when you consider that those buildings weren't always seen as particularly ancient buildings. Sometimes things just happen (fires, earthquakes, etc) and there's not enough capacity or resources or will to rebuild. Sometimes people just move on. We destroy some pretty impressive architectural feats all the time because they either had some tragic incident and it wasn't practical to rebuild or just we moved on. The old Penn Station in New York was absolutely incredible and it was demolished in the 1960s - sure ancient Greek temples and buildings are different to us, but they wouldn't have been all so different to people closer to Athenian heydays, especially if it was already partially in ruins and especially when you're, again, facing war, occupation, subjugation, in-fighting, and more war. 

tl;dr: it is a tourist power, but maybe just a different focused tourism than you might be thinking of because there's not a lot left there to see of that"
807,"If the senate inaction forces the U.S. government to “run out of money,” is it possible for the government to create it’s own revenue to temporarily cover expenses?","One of the radical ideas that seems to be floating around is to literally create more money. Technically the US finances its budget deficit by borrowing money. Normally the Treasury does this by issuing Treasury securities, which are debt. But the Treasury can also issue coins and paper money. It has been specifically proposed that they could issue a new platinum coin - a common figure suggested is 1 trillion - that it could then deposit at the Federal Reserve.

There are other ideas. Perhaps the federal government could find a way to issue debt that doesn't technically count towards the debt limit - as state governments have occasionally done? They can't reallocate funding - Congress already agreed to spend the money through the budgeting process, so that's pretty much set in stone. Much of the money is already spent; in one of the worst case scenarios, the government could use its existing revenue to pay the interest on the debt it owes, and simply cut expenditures by shutting down ""non-essential"" operations and stopping benefits payments. Of course, to most people, the government suddenly not sending out Social Security or Medicare payments is not an acceptable outcome. Perhaps the government could instead default on its debt - straight up tell the holders of Treasury securities that they will not get back the money they have loaned. This has not been done in the modern era, and most people will agree this is not a desirable outcome, although there are people who may advocate for it. Selling assets is not a solution. Social Security cost us almost a trillion dollars last year; selling a number of treasured National Parks would probably not get us to that amount.

New spending WILL happen. It's the only sensible thing to do. The question is, who will actually authorize the spending, through what means, and what will be the political ramifications of that? McConnell thinks that forcing the Democrats to raise it unilaterally - which I think they will probably do - will hurt their party in the midterms in 2022, and while I do not like the man, it may not be wise to bet against his political instincts. Democrats, of course, will have to own it for what it is - a worthwhile endeavor - and sell themselves electorally on the spending that they DO manage to agree on and pass. As a progressive Democrat, the silver lining I see is that it will be ever harder for ""moderate"" Democrats to play the ""fiscal responsibility"" card. Any Democrat at this point who believes or pretends to believe in ""balanced budgets"" or any of the other fiscal myths will find themselves increasingly at odds with reality."
808,"Why do Ohio Republicans like to nominate moderates (Gov. Mike DeWine, Sen. Rob Portman, former Gov. John Kasich) in statewide elections if they live in a state where you don’t have to nominate a moderate to win?","Ohio was historically kind of a flip state, so there are a lot of Democrats in Ohio.

809,"The Eastman Memo said Pence should not count Arizona at first, how did the timeline of the capitol attack line up with when Arizona was counted?",">What was the earliest it would have been clear he wasn't following the Eastman plan, and how much detail do we have about the other events around that time?

The Office of the Vice President release a letter at 1 PM on January 6th (when the joint session started to count the votes) essentially saying Pence wasn't going to try any funny business. It didn't get much attention (as obviously things progressed rather quickly and people were busy watching the actual process).

https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/pence-letter-on-vp-and-counting-electoral-votes/9d6f117b6b98d66f/full.pdf

The letter makes it fairly obvious Pence wasn't going to follow the Eastman plan, laying the responsibility on Congress to object and reject these votes.

Since there is no real precedent for what Eastman wanted or how Pence would have followed it, here is the Eastman memo:

http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/09/21/privileged.and.confidential.--.jan.3.memo.on.jan.6.scenario.pdf

So IF Pence was going to attempt it, Section III.c seems to indicate Pence could have read the GOP electors from Arizona, which would have been noticed as soon as they got to Arizona, or whenever they tried to certify the Arizona votes. Section III.d indicated Pence will adjourn Congress due to claims of fraud, so that also would have been immediately obvious."
810,Which German candidate is “best” for America?,"Scholz (SPD). He's an institutionalist, he's likelier to put ""the boot"" down on autocratizing regimes within the EU (no pressure from EPP membership externally or AfD competition domestically), we will likely see a status quo in NATO support, and his party's likely joint admin with the Greens will help the U.S. press Russia on petro politics as Germany (and the E.U. it leads) escapes fossil fuels at an accelerated pace. 

Of course, leaving fossil fuels also means huge economic pressure on US automakers to get their sh* together (and a faster decline of petro exports to the EU, a huge energy consumer).

Energy politics aside, SPD doesn't have to respond to interparty triangulations against AfD. They may indeed refuse to suffer fools - good for safe harbor for immigrants (Afghans) and good for growing security partnerships against emerging radical right movements."
811,Why do gas prices seem to be higher when democrats are in office?,"It's just false. It's simply not true but people say it because who's going to google the graph and prove them wrong? I am. I will do that. People like me very much, I promise.

[https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm\_epm0\_pte\_nus\_dpg&f=m](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epm0_pte_nus_dpg&f=m)

Gas prices were steady under Clinton, before 2000. Starting in 2000, with Bush's election, gas prices went up from $1.30 to $3.07 by the end of Bush's term. Obama saw a sharp reduction in gas prices quite quickly, then a rise again, then a fall just as he left office, starting at $3.09 and ending at $2.14. Trump actually saw gas prices rise during his term, from $2.05 to $2.64. And yes, prices have risen again with Biden, but that's expected given the major dip from covid and the following uncertainty as the economy recovers.

But if anything, the data supports the exact opposite of what your coworker claims. It's so very simple to show that."

818,"In the US, do tribal governments follow the US Constitution? IE can a tribe be a constitutional monarchy?","https://ncai.org/policy-issues/tribal-governance

Here's an explanation of the tribal governments. They theoretically have the ability to choose a form of government with a monarch I guess. But really, the function of the local government is to organize police, fire dept, school districts, court system. And the reservations don't handle the foreign affairs things like managing an army, relations and trade with other countries, protecting borders etc. In that system, the government is largely bureaucratic, not ceremonial and there really isn't a need for a major executive like there might be in a full-on country with a monarch. Being in tribal government is like being on the city council. It has some power, but you aren't going to make the position hereditary and hand out special titles and things like that. 

Reservation governments somewhat run like some county governments in the US. They have their own laws and their own courts, just with a little less regulation from the state than a county would. The focus of their self government is like how each state has self government, with their own constitution and control over their political system. So they set their own laws, without being controled from the state government."

It means the states and federal government can't restrict each other's criminal jurisdiction by enacting statutes.  If gambling is illegal in a state, the feds can't prevent that state from using its police power by also criminalizing gambling, thus making the state statute irrelevant.  It's not a question of individual rights as much as federalism.

The right against self-incrimination, however, applies to all crimes, state and federal.  No government entity can force you to incriminate yourself (within the bounds defined by case law) regardless of municipal, state, federal level."
820,NY Times reported that Donald Trump has taken in over $100 million in political donations in 2021.

Trump will keep all of his money in a leadership PAC because it's the easiest way to spend it on himself. It will allow him to travel the country having fun being a big celebrity, holding rallies and parties, and paying PAC management salaries to his friends and biggest supporters. This is legally justifiable as he can claim all of these expenses are necessary for his future political career, which obviously would never happen again at his age. But there's no mechanism to stop it."
821,Did Americans make more money under Trump than Biden (so far)?,"It's nearly impossible to definitively ascertain the relationship between a President's governance as a whole and something as micro as individual income.

822,AUKUS: Who are behind the pact?,"French incompetence/greed combined with US/Australian security interests are a bigger factor than any politician or lobbyist. 

Australia signed the deal with France to replace their aging sub fleet and almost immediately France had a data breach that exposed info about the capabilities of the subs that was never supposed to see the light of day. Since it has been has been signed China has continued to be an aggressor in the South China Sea, particularly around the Spratly Islands. A big consideration for Australia was the fact that the work for the subs would be done primarily on Australia and could eventually be upgraded to nuclear. Since then France has reduced the amount of work done in Australia, increased the cost, and pushed back the timeline for completion into the 2050's - far enough that Australia was forced to rebuild large parts of their aging sub fleet.

Meanwhile, China's aggressive behavior has become a huge concern for the US, Australia, and Britain. Honestly seems like France is throwing a tantrum because the government owned entity building the subs screwed up and they're embarrassed."
823,Have policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the past decades made any difference at all globally?,"Yes, but basically no.

This goes as far back as the banishment of aerosol sprays to save the Ozone Hole. Today, cap-and-trades exist, where there is a cap on total emissions amongst companies, and can sell “shares” of emissions amongst each other. We’ve done other things but, at the end of the day, this HAS made a difference. It’s not exactly measurable, but we ARE emitting less in the existence of these policies.

Please note, in terms of the wellbeing of the planet, no, they have not made a difference. We are emitting significantly more GHGs into the atmosphere than can be absorbed by the Earth’s natural carbon cycles.

We need to make policies that hold industries and businesses accountable to the social and environmental costs they make. This means significantly lowering the cap in cap-and-trade policies, shifting fossil fuel subsidies to renewable alternatives, banishing the use of plastics in packaging, ending ocean trawling and soil tilling in agriculture. 

But domestic policy must improve, too. Countries should increase funding for electric public transit as an alternative to the now inconvenient the prospect of owning car that runs on expensive gas (with the aforementioned subsidy shift). They must also section off big parts of land to heal and improve biodiversity. This also means significantly increase funding for recycling plants for glass and metal (as alternatives to plastic packaging) and composting plants for compostable waste (food waste and compostable packaging).

There ARE really good policies that can be implemented. But nothing we have done so far has bestowed any meaningful change. This is what I have dedicated my life towards achieving."

825,Why is the debt ceiling such a recurring issue in the US?,"The debt ceiling was specifically created and designed to be a recurring issue. It was created back when the dollar was on the gold standard. Under a commodity currency fiscal policy makers need to keep an eye on how much federal debt exists because something like a bank run on the federal reserves could happen, which would have crashed the US economy. The idea behind the debt ceiling was that lawmakers were acknowledging they were in unique times which required the government to spend much more than it was used to spending, however they did not want this to become the norm during economic booms. So they put a ceiling in place. The idea was that if there was *no* ceiling the government would take on ever increasing amounts of debt without Congress ever being forced to confront it. The debt ceiling was designed to be able to be raised with legislation specifically so that the government *could* borrow more if needed, but that lawmakers would have to have a debate about what level of debt was acceptable and prudent before raising the ceiling. It was made to be a recurring issue specifically so that lawmakers would debate it on a recurring basis.

However, the economic forces which underpinned this thinking are no longer in play in the US. In 1971 the US abandoned the gold standard permanently. Ever since then the US dollar has been a fiat currency and the US government has been a currency sovereign. Sovereign debt works completely differently for a currency sovereign. The supply of currency available to a currency sovereign is based on the productive capacity of the economy it manages, not the supply of gold stored in a vault somewhere. The idea that too high a debt is bad for a currency sovereign because if that debt comes due someday they won't have the money to pay it just simply doesn't make sense. We control the supply of currency. It makes no sense for us to focus on the level of debt as a number, but rather to look at what the budget is being used to fund/purchase.

Under our current monetary system the debt ceiling absolutely SHOULD be eliminated. At best it's a distraction which forces law makers to waste time and political capital focusing on a number which really doesn't tell you anything about the economy or budget. It's like trying to control how fast your car is going by measuring RPMs. You can be going very fast with low RPMs on a high gear and very slow with high RPMs on a low gear or vice versa. Likewise, you can have a strong, thriving economy with high debt and a weak economy with low debt, or vice versa."

The way that the federal government funds itself is part of the issue.

They have some obnoxious chunk of funding tied up in trust funds for various things so that the state can’t invest in new things or adapt to crises as easily. It’s viewed as a long term structural problem in the state budget."
834,"If a US Congressperson leaves office mid-term and a special election is held, will the new representative assume any committee roles that the previous representative held?","Not automatically. The party leadership submits a replacement person for the outgoing congressperson to take over the role. Seats on committees are not intended to follow districts, but instead be for individuals."
835,Is Duverger’s law correct?,"Long story short, this article is not a very good one but it's not a very bad one either. It is making a couple mistakes and painting with an overly broad brush, but if you soften its claims and make it think less absolutely, then it does have some valuable discussion.

The first issue I have with this article is that it slightly mischaracterizes Duverger's Law. Duverger's Law says that majoritarian or plurality voting *in single member districts* tends to create 2 party systems. However, this article does not address the italicized bit. It seeks to prove that FPTP alone does not ensure two party systems. And while that's correct, Duverger's Law is really not making that claim. Duverger's Law is about SMDP (single member district plurality) where the relationship is much stronger.

I also think the metric used in the graphs is a bit flawed. Looking at the US, it favors the US because everything neatly falls into the two colored bits, indicating that quite often an absolute majority is reached in any given race, and it's a clear two party system because both sides have lots of dots, right? The problem here is that this can indicate polarized one party rule as much as it does genuine two party rule. The US has a lot of races, and many of them are non-competitive, and while that's not necessarily as bad as it sounds, the result is that in a lot of races, there really aren't even two viable parties. This doesn't support Duverger's Law because Duverger's Law indicates that SMDP creates two parties because all that matters is getting 50%+1 and so building alliances that can get your whole ""side"" unified under one banner is the optimal play. There's some similarity to the Median Voter Theorem in that regard.

But the US right now isn't actually seeing both parties show that kind of behavior. Take a look at the recall election that happened just yesterday--instead of finding a candidate that can unite all the right of center folks, the Reps ran a far right candidate that had no chance of getting majority support. Duverger's Law implies that the Reps would chase a majority and that's why there is no space for third parties. Instead they punted and ran a minority candidate they hoped to win by a fluky plurality.

Then the article shifts to the UK, and makes the case that the dots are less cleanly in the colored areas, so less 2-party voting. But I'm not sure this is fair. For one thing, let's talk about the Liberal Democrats. It's tempting to look at them and say ""they're a third party and they have 12 seats so clearly the UK isn't a two party system!"" I think this is a mistake because it ignores the context of the Lib Dems entirely. There was a time the Lib Dems were the main left-leaning party in the UK, until Labour (which was at the time an actual socialist party) broken in, started taking their seats, and eventually became the main left-leaning party in their stead. For a little while, there was a bit of a coalition between them, with Labour clearly the main guys but the Lib Dems still having maybe half their seats and forming a true, two-party left. However, in recent years this has dwindled down to almost nothing. The Lib Dems having only 12 seats is one of their lowest points in history. In short, this isn't a party that has anchored itself as a different flavour of leftness in the political spectrum--it's a party whose flavour of leftness has been declining over the decades to its current point of near irrelevance. This is a dying party. The Lib Dems are a third party, but for how much longer will they be any more influential than the US's Greens or Libertarians?

Further, even in cases where the whole picture isn't summed up just in Tory-Labour, like in areas with the Scottish or Welsh nationalist parties, we aren't really seeing so much of a multiparty race as we are seeing a different two party structure. For example, in all of England, 90% of the districts are two horse races between Con and Lab. Once we get into Scotland we see mostly two horse races with SNP and either Con or Lab. It's exceedingly rare to see a real multiparty race. We see it somewhat in Northern Ireland/Wales, but that's a bit of an outlier situation. I think folks forget how much the UK is really 4 countries put together in one United Kingdom. So to say that the UK is multiparty system because four different countries have two main parties and a third of varying strength, therefore Duverger's Law is false, is a bit beyond the pale.

So yes, while there are SOME weaknesses with Duverger's Law in the UK, it's certainly more true than it is false. And when you compare the UK to other parliamentary structures, the UK is one of the systems with the lowest number of parties. Compare the UK to Germany or France. Those are true multiparty systems and Germany at least uses multimember districts but is in other ways fairly similar to the UK's structure. Duverger's Law would predict that the more you do SMDP-type structures, the fewer parties. Most of Europe proves that out.

I don't really know enough about India's system to comment, but I would like to revisit a point about the US that this article does not address at all. And that's the fact that the US does have real, actual third parties, but first of all not the ones that the article talks about, and second of all, they exist in a way which confirms Duverger's Law.

First, the Libertarians and to a lesser extent the Greens are not actual political parties. They do not try to win elections. The Libertarians last year ran Jo Jorgensen for president, a candidate who failed to win a local race and made a whole political platform that commented on every issue with a plan she would enact if elected. But this is stupid. She had no allies in Congress. Even a voter did agree with her that all sex work should be legalized on day one, how would she do that with zero Libertarians in Congress? She made a promise she knew she couldn't fulfill in our system, and not just because it was hard to do, but because it was functionally impossible.

Actual political parties don't do this. They organize grassroots support. They have local voter groups that can vet candidates for local, statewide, or lower federal office. They create volunteer networks and reach out across the political system to activists, organizations and so on that can broaden their support. They try and actually run candidates that can win. We do have that in the US, but not from the Libertarians.

By any definition, the Tea Party was a third party. Same with the Progressives and the Trump Republicans. These are folks who had a set of actionable principles organized into a platform with a plan to get there. They ran candidates in a variety of races to gain political influence. They challenged the dominant party on their own ""side"" and actually gained voters from them. This is what a true third party looks like.

But at the end of the day, all three of these parties have chosen to crash into the dominant party and rearrange their priorities, fusing together into a new take on the left or right. This is where Duverger's Law comes in. The reality is that a third party that actually has real potential (not the Libs) does need to join into the two party system to maintain its competitive position. Trump did this almost immediately, the Squad has gradually settled down to become far-left establishment folks but no longer actively opposed to the Dems, and the Tea Party became so ingrained into the party that they successfully made themselves the norm when they ousted Boehner and replaced him with Ryan. This is the strongest evidence for Duverger's Law. The US is actually living in a bit of a golden age for third parties, oddly enough. Duverger's Law is why that is true and we still only have Dems and Reps.

So overall the article does raise some good points in that there is no slavish, ultra-hard relationship between SMDP and two parties. However, I would posit that understanding a Law like that is somewhat inappropriate even in hard sciences and is definitely inappropriate in social sciences. Duverger's Law IS correct in that SMDP does pull a system more towards two party structures than anything else, and unless you have other systems in place to weaken that pull (like a Westminster Parliament in the UK), you're very likely to end up with a strong two party system as the US shows. But even in the US, this is as much about other things that reinforce Duverger's Law (federalism and checks and balances really help the two party system a LOT) as it is SMDP is some irrevocable benchmark.

Overall, the article does begin a good discussion in certain areas. But as someone who has a degree in political science and has studied this, it's a bit like an American who is fluent in Spanish living in Spain. They can speak Spanish way, way better than most Americans. But their accent is just a bit off, and you can just tell this is their second language. They're not exactly wrong, per se, but no one would make them out to be a natural-born Spanish speaker.  This article is like that. It is not talking about some things it should, and it's harping on some things it shouldn't, and overall it's kinda going in the right direction but missing some key context."
836,Is there anything in place to provide for political stability during times of global mass migration?,"Mass migration in the sense you're thinking is almost exclusively due to political, not environmental concerns.

Not only does the environment change very slowly (in comparison to human life spans), but lacking resources in one area isn't actually a problem because we can transport resources.

Consider New York City. Nothing grows there, but people manage to eat. It doesn't have freshwater reserves even a fraction of what is necessary to sustain its population, yet they manage to drink. It can't produce enough power to keep the lights on, but the lights remain on. If people aren't fleeing New York City en masse, why would they flee places that can actually support themselves now because it's slightly harder to do so in the future?"
837,"Is the Scandanavian model of economics actually ""Democratic Socialism"" or is that something just made up?","So our economic model is actually a capitalistic outset, with varying formats of taxation, (dependant on which country, and their focusses) which helps to create a stronger outset for a better social democratic public policy.

Our public policy Are how ever more focused towards social democracy, which entails a focus on a broad spectrum of public services like free education, free health care, good social services, humane prison etc. (all of this of course not being free, but paid for though taxes)
This helps us have a largely egalitarian society, with most of the basic nescesseties being ensured, so that we can focus on getting a good carrier, a life worth living, all in reletive comfort from the get go.

Of course there are differing oppinions on taxation within our countries, however a large percent age of us are fine with the rellatively high taxes we pay, because we collectively benefit one way or another.
We have amongst the highest educated populus, highest standard of living, highest happiness and lowest coription in the world, all because og our social Outlook on life.

838,Can someone please explain Biden’s tax policy/plan like one would to a child?,"The first and most important thing to understand is that there is no policy or bill yet. There is a loose outline of priorities which have general broad agreement from the key Democrats who will be needed to pass it, but they haven't finished writing the actual bill yet. Any discussion about what is or is not in the policy is entirely based on priorities Biden has said he *wants* in the bill, but nothing is guaranteed until the bill is written and passed. 

It's also important to note that while there is broad agreement among Democrats as to the priorities of the policy, there is a LOT of disagreement on the specifics. For example, Senator Bernie Sanders, chair of the Senate Budget Committee which is writing the bill, has presented a goal for a $3.5 trillion bill and he's said that anything less would be a non-starter for him. Meanwhile, conservative Democrat Joe Manchin has said that anything higher than $1.5 trillion is a non-starter for him. The plan put forth by the Biden administration is more in line with Sanders' preferred $3.5 trillion. So either Manchin will have to accept the higher price tag or Biden and Sanders will have to cut some of their priorities from the bill.

The tax increases included in the policy outline are:

* An increase in the top marginal corporate tax rate to 26.5%. This only applies to corporate income over $5 million. Everything up to $400k is taxed at 18% (unchanged) and everything from $400k to $5 mil is 21% (unchanged). In 2017 the GOP cut this top rate from 26.5% to 21%, so this is just reverting it to the pre-2017 rate.

* An increase in the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6%. In 2017 the GOP cut this rate from 39.6% to 37%, so this is just reverting it to the pre-2017 rate.

* A 3% 1-time surcharge on individual income above $5 million

* A 25% capital gains tax

* No tax increase on anyone who makes $400,000 or less

* An increase to the federal tobacco tax (applied to the retail sale of tobacco products)

* A reduction in various tax deductions for high-income individuals and corporations

* An increase in the IRS's budget by $79 billion to help enforce already existing taxes on high income individuals and corporations which are currently going unpaid.

The policy outline as it exists now very specifically does NOT increase taxes on anyone making less than $400k annually (except, maybe, the increased tobacco tax if you purchase tobacco products). We'll have to see what the actual bill looks like when it's done being written to know if that changes."
839,Would you consider the Koch brothers as neoliberals?,"Charles Koch ascribes to much more extreme economics. His guru from the 1960s to 1980 was Murray Rothbard, after 1980 James McGill Buchanan. Rothbard was a classic Austrian school economist, Buchanan established the 'Virginia school'.

>They're often labeled as conservatives and libertarians, but their whole aim is for total privatization and deregulation of the economy.

How is Libertarian not synonymous with privatization/shutting down public services and deregulation?

I think it is more that you don't understand the difference between neoliberalism and libertarianism. Which is kinda subtle."
840,Many mid-large sized companies have some sort of procurement department.

841,"Why, across most of the world, do men support right-of-centre parties and women support left-of-centre parties?","Hector Garcia has a fantastic book that explores gender and voting patterns. The TLDR of the book is: Men are more justice, rule bound, binary and hierarchal hence why they tend to vote conservative unless there is a reason not to (like race-- black men are quite conservative but can't vote that way for obvious reasons). 

Women are more about loyalty to the community and that manifests itself either positively like education for children, equality for the marginalized, or negatively like abortion and hyperreligiosity. If you notice women tend to be more ""true believers"" than men, while men occupy the leadership positions indifferent to the cause but quite interested in the power associated with the leadership position. He uses data to back up his claims and it's quite an interesting read!"
842,Why hasn't leftism (ideology and causes) been able to gain a larger audience across the American South?,"It might help to think of these issues in the way conservatives do:  
- The left doesn't want to fix inequality. They just want to be on top.  
- The left doesn't want to help People of Color. They just want to exploit them by emphasizing their victimhood.  
- The left doesn't want to fix poverty. They just want to make it easier for people to suffer in poverty.  
- The left doesn't want to make women happier. They want women to be forced into behavior that favors a few at the expense of the many.

You might also consider that what the left views as major problems simply aren't for many conservatives. Liberals tend to be in situations where you have inequality and little autonomy - they have far less confidence in their own personal ability to deal with their problems. In contrast, conservatives tend to be in situations where there is broad egalitarianism and a great deal of autonomy, so they have far less need/desire for government to protect them at the expense of other people making decisions for them.

Ultimately, I think you may be making the mistake of presuming that everyone shares not just your judgment about what are the critical problems facing our society but how those problems should be addressed."
843,What ideology/party would this person be considered?,"This seems straight libertarian. Their interest in Sanders is from their populist sentiments, not some of Sanders’ more leftist views."
844,"What does a ""lobbying blitz"" entail and how could that help get policy through?","Sometimes there is enough ""soft"" support or opposition for a bill that a lobbying blitz can be effective in firming up those votes and passing or killing legislation. Other times legislation might be existential to a special interest group or industry, and so regardless of the likelihood of success they have no choice but to go all out rather than watch a bill pass (or fail) that would change their industry as they know it (for the perceived worse). 

Lobbying blitzes often include tactics beyond formal lobbying. They generally manifest as a combination of lobbying and public affairs influence campaigns. So, yes, you may have a higher volume of shoe leather lobbying speaking with a greater number of Senators -- but you would probably also see local electeds, personal friends, or other high-profile or powerful influencers and key opinion leaders get engaged. There could be radio, TV, and digital ad campaigns. There could be grassroots letter-writing and patch through call campaigns (these last two are when a company or group contacts voters, educates them on an issue, and patches them through to the congressional switchboard to advocate directly with their members).

At the end of a day, a successful lobbying blitz creates a surround sound/echo chamber of support/opposition over an issue, ratcheting up the volume and pressure until a member changes their position. At the very least, it makes the vote harder to take, and makes the target legislators less comfortable with holding their ground.

Some lobbying is for show. Some groups just need to go back to their bosses and say, ""We tried."" But rarely will they go all out and spend serious money unless it's actually something important to them."
845,"Did 9/11 lead, directly or indirectly, to Brexit?","It's tenuous at best. Remainers have often talked about the xenophobia that fueled much of the Leave talk. But it's not like racism was only invented after 9/11. Certainly there was some increased hostility to immigrants, but much of the UK's issues with xenophobia were economic concerns, not safety. For example, Remainers thought immigrants were stealing jobs in healthcare because the NHS relied on so many foreign workers. If it was 9/11 fueled you'd think it was more about concerns about crime, terrorism, or similar matters, and that just wasn't a big issue in the Brexit debate.

I suppose you could also argue that 9/11 exposed some chinks in the US's armor and the subsequent war in Iraq was a disaster that drove a bit of a wedge between the US and the UK, which facilitated some general discontent in a once-unified NATO bloc, but again...Brexit was leaving the EU, not NATO, and the US isn't part of the EU, so...it's just a really weak connection.

I don't think there's much of an argument you could make here. At the least it's an argument full of holes."

848,"Which branch of Congress has more power, the House of Representatives or the Senate?","I think the Senate edges out the House because they confirm Executive appointments.

The House has an edge on paper in that all spending bills must originate in the House. However, in practice spending bills tend to be so complicated to get through both Houses that it has to be a collaboration between the two if the bill has any hopes of passing.

Impeachment is another area where the two chambers have different powers. The House impeaches while the Senate hosts the trial. However, impeachment has rarely had much of a practical impact.

I think on pretty much all other matters the two chambers have virtually the same powers, even if they don't always wield those powers equally.

However, the Senate's ability to block Executive appointments and control confirmations to the Judiciary is a HUGE power that the House does not share."
849,How does the California governor recall work?,"The process to recall is a bit complex. First someone needs to initiate the recall process. This is just filing some paperwork with the state. They then have 160 days to gather enough signatures of registered voters to trigger a recall election. That requires 12% of the number of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election   from at least 5 different counties, and the number of signatures from each county has to be at least 1% of the votes cast from that county. It's a bit complicated, but this ends up being a pretty small percentage of  the total population of California.

Almost every governor of California gets a recall process started against them. Most don't get the signatures required. This attempt wouldn't have, except that the people organizing the recall sued the state claiming that due to COVID 160 days wasn't long enough to gather the signatures. They were granted an extension and were able to get enough then.

If the signatures are gathered and submitted within the 160 day window then a recall election is scheduled. This election has 2 questions. First is ""Should the Governor be removed?"" This just yes/no. If 50%+1 vote yes, then the Governor is removed. If 50%+1 vote no, the governor keeps their job. The second question is, ""If the governor is removed, who should get the job?"" Then a list of all the candidates who have qualified for the ballot. It's actually pretty easy in California to get on the ballot, so this is going to be a lot of names. If the first question results in yes (recall the governor) then the winner of the second is just whoever gets the most votes.

>Say 49% of people vote not to recall, 51% vote yes, and the highest replacement gets 25% of the votes. Is that person the new governor?

Yes, this is exactly how it works. Many people do, in fact, think it is bullshit.

> Can this happen in other states?

Yes, but not in all, and no other state uses an identical system. 

29 states have no recall mechanism at all. 

1 state (Virginia) holds a trial instead of an election. If enough signatures are gathered in VA to trigger a recall (25% of the votes cast in the previous election) the state courts hold a trial. If the judges decide against the Governor, they are immediately recalled and the lieutenant governor takes over. 

In another 13 states they first hold a referendum asking if the governor should be recalled. If the answer is yes, then there is a special election scheduled to select the new governor. In some of these states the recalled incumbent governor can run for their seat back, in some they cannot. In 8 of these states the governor, even if recalled, retains their job until after the special election. In the other 5 they are immediately removed from office and a temporary governor (usually the lieutenant governor) takes the seat until the second election is decided.

The remaining 6 states have a similar process to California where the Yes/No and Who questions are on the same ballot.

In every state the number of signatures needed to initiate a recall and the time frame to get those signatures is different."

852,What was the Strategic logic behind the 9/11 attacks?,"After bin Laden was killed, we seized a large number of documents in which he outlined his goals and thinking. In terms of 9/11, he wanted to ""break the fear of this false god and destroy the myth of American invincibility."" What he anticipated is that the American public would rise up in opposition to military involvement in the Muslim world, undermining the various authoritarian leaders so that Islamic revolutionaries could take their place. He envisioned that the U.S. would reject Israel and Israel would fall without its economic support.

A good article on it:  
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2021-08-13/osama-bin-ladens-911-catastrophic-success

Note: The notion that bin Laden intended to get the U.S. involved in a series of wars that would bankrupt it was derived from a speech he gave *after* the U.S. had already demonstrated it wasn't going to back away from the Muslim world, it doesn't reflect his strategic thinking in the run-up to 9/11."
853,When do you expect Donald Trump to announce decision on the 2024 election?,"The usual strategy is to wait as long as you can, because announcing early just puts a target on your back. If Trump announces he's running in 2024 now, it allows Democrats three years to get their base riled up about him, sharpen their attacks on him, get their politicians to fundraise off him, etc. And that's especially bad for him given that he's still banned on Twitter for the time being--his opponents have a platform to attack him there, and he can't counter.

But Trump infamously cares more about ego gratification than strategy. So my guess is that his advisers will try to get him to avoid the topic, and that that will be 75% unsuccessful, because he wants the attention."
854,What is the likelihood that the Liberals could lose in the upcoming Canadian election?,"Depends on what your definition of losing is I guess.

It's true that the most recent slate of polling as the horse racing has simmered down show a pretty tight line between the Liberals and Conservatives, though with the Liberals still projected to have a slight lead on seats.

On odds, the CBC's latest is (with huge asterisks of uncertainty):

* 10% Probability of the Liberals winning a majority
* 44% Probability of the Liberals winning the most seats but not a majority
* 41% Probability of the Conservatives winning the most seats but not a majority
* 5% Probability of the Conservatives winning a majority

In my opinion, there's a 'lose' to lose seats but a relatively minor one for the most part, official coalition or not, their centre-left-left tent is still standing strongly enough in that scenario (most likely) to largely survive the majority of their agenda. The 5% of losing to the Conservatives by the Conservatives winning a majority, to me, is the undeniable and actual loss and with that, it's low odds but it's obviously still a possibility.

But still both losses to some degree. He certainly called for the elections with a high hopes of shoring up their mandate, which he may still get, but it certainly doesn't look as sure as it did when he called for them. It wouldn't be the first time a PM has called for a snap election and lost (to varying degrees of what counts as an L)"
855,There have been 3 successful military coups this year. What actually causes a military coup if there is no external incitement for a coup?,"/u/UmberGryphon's suggestion is an excellent one, and the book that video is based on (The Dictator's Handbook) or its predecessor (The Logic of Political Survival, if you are up for something a bit drier and stat focused) go into greater depth on the subject if it interests you. But to summarize, one of the book's main assertions is to push back on the idea that a dictator has absolute power in their own country (which might undergird the notion that outside intervention is necessary to create a military coup - it's supported by the image that a dictator is all powerful in their own country and can only be kept in check by stronger outside powers). Dictators have a constituency just like democratically elected leaders, but their constituency looks very different and their actions as ruler reflect that. Taking away food from the poor to give it to your highest ranking general (hugely oversimplified example)? Genuinely a terrible idea in a democracy, but a necessary decision for a dictator, because that General could team up with the guy who runs your treasury and effectively pull the country out from under you. If a democratically elected leader does not satisfy their constituency, they are removed from power via election. If a dictator does not satisfy their constituency, they are removed from power via coup.

So to go down the road a little bit with this and try to answer your question, a coup in Australia would reflect a change in Australia's constituency. It's arguably a much more dramatic shift than a fledgling democracy falling back into a dictatorship or one dictator getting replaced by another, and I personally might look more to the economy or environmental/social factors than the existence of other coups this year if I were really concerned about Australia's fate. I don't know enough about Argentina in the 1900s to know if it's an appropriate parallel, but I do tend to be a little skeptical of such comparisons as they're rarely as perfect a fit as they seem to be at first glance. My guess is that if Australia's democratic institutions are so weak that a coup is really in the cards, it'll probably go down in a uniquely Australian way.

As a teeny tiny side note, I do think one of the most underrated elements of Mesquita's books is his discussions on corporate politics and boardrooms, which was understandably overlooked when he had all this interesting stuff to say about dictators. So to anyone who like's CGP Grey's video, the book is really worth a read!"

862,Did President's have White House staff / staff in general from other / former Presidential administrations,"Throughout the federal government, there are ""political appointees"" and career government officials. Political appointees generally, almost universally, will not stay on when the White house switches party control. Career officials generally do.

For example, since he's been in the news this past year, Dr. Fauci has worked at NIH for decades in various positions. He's a career official setting policy on scientific matters that should be apolitical, so it is a good thing that these positions are not politically appointed.

Most staff that work in the White House are political appointees, so they rotate in and out with the administration.

The only positions that are ""for life"" are in the judiciary."
863,What would happen if a NATO member would take another NATO members country,"The NATO treaty, article 5:

""The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.""

So if Iceland committed an armed attack against a NATO member, the fact that Iceland is also a NATO member would be irrelevant, and all of NATO would do whatever it took to defend Denmark, up to and including going to war with Iceland."
864,How hostile is the US stance toward the Taliban regime?,"You’re conflating Al Qaeda with the Taliban, the Taliban never flew planes into anything. They gave safe harbor to a terrorist organization that resulted in them having to wage a bloody guerrilla war where they were mercilessly slaughtered for 20 years, hard to imagine they don’t somewhat regret it. They will likely be busy looking inward for a long time. 



Anything anyone has to say about the future is just a guess, but I would assume we will remain hostile to the Taliban while not actively engaging in war-like activity unless some actionable threat is uncovered. We will probably sanction them even further into the Stone Age and do everything we can to prevent them from gaining a seat at the international table. Russia, China and Pakistan will cozy up to them though.


The idea that the Taliban is going to start committing terrorist attacks using planes against other nations now is wildly unlikely, they just got the nation back. All that would accomplish is them getting blown up some more."
865,Why can’t the federal government approve a tax for businesses that have profited off of the Coronavirus?,"Besides the political reasons that others have mentioned, the US has a constitutional prohibition on *ex post facto* laws.  In theory, Congress could pass a tax on *future* profits, but they can't retroactively tax revenue that was already made in 2020."
866,How does the US government get intel on upcoming attacks?,"Probably a mix of sources from across the Intelligence Community.

870,Did the Speculation that the Capitol Insurrection was an Internal Conspiracy Lead Anywhere?,"> I heard news speculation about many security personnel being absent suddenly on the day, parts of the mob giving directions for inside the building, prominent political figures leaving the area prematurely

Where did you hear these things? A lot of these rumors traveled mostly on social media rather than in any kind of official reports, so they should have been taken with a grain of salt from the beginning. I didn't hear the first or third rumor in the legitimate media at all. People were questioning the second one publicly, but I don't think any conclusion was found. The FBI investigation thus far has not shown any links between politicians and the people acting on the ground, but we don't know what exactly they've looked at on the politician side. Congress is conducting its own investigation and has [asked telecom companies to save data for a group of Congresspeople they believe could be involved](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/30/politics/january-6-phone-records-members-of-congress/index.html), but getting that information released will be a complicated process. It'll probably be a long time until we know more."
871,How competent (or incompetent) was the Bush administration's provisional government during the Iraq occupation?,"What we tend to believe is that large, complex institutions are best run by smart, competent people.

The reality is that they're not. Indeed, the primary qualifications for those at the top of chain have nothing to do with intelligence or competency but social/political skills to reach and maintain that position. The 'competency' is entirely borrowed from their subordinates and is largely reliant on being just smart enough to listen to what they're saying.

The problem that occurs in places like Iraq is that while there are plenty of people able to operate effectively as a Director of the Foreign Ministry, there's very few people able to operate effectively as part of the *staff* of such an organization. When you're replacing the previous staff wholesale, that means you need to build the institution from scratch without having access to anyone who can actually do the wide array of jobs required.

So while it may seem wrong that a newly appointed Director of the Foreign Ministry was googling how to do his job, this is actually far closer to the norm than you might imagine. Any (decent) senior executive in any institution is going to spend a fair bit of time researching the institution they're chosen to run."
872,Why don't Democrat/Republican policies just apply to the voter?,"Because it's completely untenable.

There are an infinite amount of policies that can't be separated by who the voter voted for-- take for example funds allocated to help fight climate change. Tons of Republicans are against spending money on anything to do with that. But that money then goes into projects to reduce C02 being released into the air, less heavy metals in water streams. Every person drinks water, every person breathes. How would they be excluded from this policy? Are they going to stop drinking water and breathing?

Tons of more liberal voters want to reduce police budgets or reallocate the funding for community services. Are police officers going to ask to see their voting record before stopping the person from being assaulted on the street by another stranger?

Not to mention many policies take months or years to enact and voters can choose to vote for either party in every election. How are we to keep track of a tangled web of policy choices, who they affect, and who they voted for in each election?"
873,How does Biden's long-term capital gains tax proposal work?,"If you, for example, sell stocks that you've held long enough to quality for the long-term capital gains tax rate, you will have to pay the rate above on the profit you made on the sale. If you sell less than $40k you pay nothing. If you sell less than \~$441k, you'll pay nothing on the first $40k and then a 15% tax on the profit between $40k and $441k, etc.  


The difference between now and Biden's plan here would be the new 39.6% rate. Right now the rate caps at 20%"
874,Why is President Biden being blamed for the situation in Afghanistan,"It’s because Biden left hundreds of American citizens in Afghanistan, as well as leaving a surplus of weapons for the Taliban to use. The Taliban is literally using U.S. aircraft to hang people.

If Biden didn’t do either of those, he’d probably get a LOT less hate."

876,I thought the infrastructure bill passed the senate? Why are people talking about it as if it hasn't passed?,A bill only goes to the president for signature once the same text has been voted on by the House and the Senate. In the case of the infrastructure bill the House passed a bill several months ago. The senate then completely rewrote that bill. The bill is now back with the house to either pass in its current form or amend and send back to senate.
877,Trump recently endorsed the vaccine at a rally in Alabama - why is he suddenly now endorsing it?,"Trump has been sort of half endorsing the vaccine for a while now. He has actually been pretty deliberate about not spreading false information about the vaccines themselves, despite fear-mongering about mandates. Clearly, he wants to be able to take credit for the vaccines, and blame Delta on Biden."
878,"Why USA did not place harsher sanctions on Russia, like cutting off SWIFT or embargo?","Cutting the Russians off from SWIFT may devastate the Russian economy but it could also cause serious economic damage to the allies of the United States as well as neutral third-party countries. The unintended blowback that may have resulted could very easily end up being worse for the United States in long run then anything it did to the Russians.   


The United States may have found itself diplomatically isolated after such a move if it was made unilaterally. Many states would feel pressure from their citizens to move against the Americans and no longer support their initiatives to isolate the Russians if they were damaged in the process. Long term you could see support for the development of a SWIFT-alternative that was not controlled by the Americans if the Europeans and other important trading nations felt the Americans were no longer trust worthy stewards of such a sytem.   


The Americans are also concerned about pushing the Russians too far with punishments. Sanctions are designed to hurt but the Americans don't want them to hurt so badly that the Russians see military conflict as the only solution to their problem. Does cutting the Russian off from SWIFT or enacting an embargo convince the Russians to change their behavior or does it convince them to double down? If the Russians feel they have nothing else to lose economically why shouldn't they say for example simply take everything in Ukraine east of the Dneiper River? Harsh sanctions could result in the situation becoming worse not better.  


You must also consider the fact that strategically the United States is shifting its focus and resources over to the Pacific to deal with the rising threat of China. While Europe is still an important region for the United States it is significantly less important to them then it was 20-30 years ago. The issues that are happening in Ukraine are much more important to the Europeans and their security then it is to the Americans. If the Europeans do not wish to punish the Russians any more harshly why should the Americans go out of their way to do any more then the bare minimum to secure their own interests?   


Overall, the US hasn't done as much to Russia as they could because their interests have shifted. The Americans have no real interest in starting a Cold War 2.0 at a time when they are in the process of gearing up for a potential fight with the Chinese in the Pacific. They have to balance the desire to deter Russian behavior with the reality that they not want to push them so hard that the security situation in Europe becomes worse."
879,Is the US military seen as a christian military force similar in non western countries similar to how the taliban and isis is shown to be categorized by Islam?,"
>From what I read the goal of the Taliban is to take control of Afghanistan and not to force Islam on the world or anything like that.

Technically, that is false. 

The fundamentalist branch of Sunni Islam the Taliban believe in commands that every person on Earth must convert to Islam, by force if necessary. 

The Taliban aren't stupid enough to believe they can actually do that, but they believe in the goal enough to shelter terrorist groups like Al Qaeda who effectively wished to spread Islam through force. 

>So my question is does the world (specifically the Middle East) view the US military as an overtly Christian organization and the things we do as a reflection of the religion?

The Taliban is an explicitly theocratic government. The USA is a secular government. 

No sane or credible person considers the Western coalition in Afghanistan to be a Christian crusading army."
880,"Shouldn't massive countries like the US, Russia, China, India be self-sustainable? Why do these countries try to meddle in other countries to hold of the resources of those countries?","No country has 100% of all its needs. The US still imports more crude oil then we export, for example but export more refined oil products. Also several things (like touch screens on cell phones) require trace elements that are either damaging to the environment to mine, or by products of mining of other things that damages the environment as well. US regulations make it expensive to do that domestically (which we totally could), but other countries can do it for cheaper since they don't care about the environment like we do."
881,"How is the Montreux Convention enforced? Turkey doesn't want it, what would happen if they just disregarded it?","Ultimately, if it were important enough, let's just say there would indeed be military vessels passing through the Bosporus Strait.

Anyhow, this is like any other question of law- you can argue what's legal and illegal, right and wrong all day, but ultimately laws don't enforce themselves. Some entity has to enforce them. If you can't apply enough military, economic or (for those states that care about reputation) diplomatic pressure to get someone to comply with the law, they're free to ignore it."

883,Why did Trudeau request a snap election? The last election was just in 2019.,He's taking a gamble on shoring up his party's mandate. He's counting on high vaccination rates and a post-pandemic economic rebound and that voters approve of his COVID recovery plan.
884,Comparing Realclearpolitics vs Fivethirtyeight polling averages model: which is the better one?,"Two presidential elections is hardly a robust measure, particularly when you cherry pick data like this. 538 was well known for correctly stating time and again that Trump had a better chance to win in 2016 than most folks would admit largely because of the possibility that he wins the EC but loses the popular vote, and that's exactly what happened. You're also only looking at the popular vote in one race and not looking at other information like House or Senate races or state-level polling.

But overall, the main reason this post is junk is because you're actually not measuring the right thing. 538 never claims that their polls are a direct prediction for the popular vote. They have said very specifically that there are many flaws with such a method, which is why they instead produce a model to predict the outcome of the election. You can see that here:

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/)

It very clearly projects a popular vote of 48.5% for Clinton, a less than 1 point difference from the actual outcome. You're right that they were further off for Trump, but their 44.9% was closer than RCP's 43.3%. 

Further, the way 538 adjusts polls has little to do with their own interpretative license and more to do with regular mathematic adjustments. When they see that a poll produces consistently skewed results compared to actual, they will ""adjust"" the poll to show the result without their historic and consistent polling error. This is a mathematically sound process that is explained on their pollster rating page here:

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/)

I could go further into the math and bring up more examples from the 2020 election to show how you're using the data wrong, but I think I've shown my point well enough. 538 does a great job explaining the math behind this stuff and I recommend you take a look at more of their content that talks about how polling data is used in the field because it will teach you a lot. It's not their fault you're using a hammer on a screw and claiming nails are better."
885,Why does it seem the progressive movement within the Democratic party has slowed to nearly a halt.,"Well I think the problem is that the progressive movement was portrayed as more widespread than it actually is. 

 Progressives tend to be a bit louder and more vocal about their beliefs, and frequently attack the Democratic establishment. This gets them lots of media coverage. In relation to the media coverage conservative media like Fox News use them as a bogeyman. 


    But it wasn’t the progressives that won the Democrats the House in 2018. Many of the progressives were from safe blue districts. 


 Moderate Democrats were more likely to flip GOP seats. Most of the Democratic caucus is moderate. The progressives are a minority albeit a vocal one. 

  Progressives and their fans tend to be younger too. The fact is that younger people aren’t the most reliable voters when it comes to turnout. Older people are and they tend to be moderate. 


   But it should be considered that in recent years the Democratic Party has moved significantly to the left. Biden is a moderate in today’s party but he’s much more left leaning than Obama was when he first ran. Some of his positions would’ve been unthinkable in the Obama years. 

  Progressives are a minority. But they have influenced moderate Democrats to move more left."
886,Why is it better to give a blank vote than to not vote at all? (Germany),"Other answers here have missed the point of your question. 

If you fail to cast any vote, that is just going to be discounted as part of low turnout. It's a sign that you are either ignorant of politics or just don't care about the outcome. 

If you cast a blank vote then you are saying that you do care about politics, but that none of the candidates on the ballot have your support."

888,Should balancing civic responsibility and individual autonomy be the focus of 'anti-mask'/'anti-vaccine' or 'Free to choose' debates and discussions?,"I definitely have heard arguments about civil responsibility, and attacks on anti-vaxers/maskers as selfish, but I think the reason this hasn't been the focus of the debate is that it's not the main argument that anti-vaxers/maskers make. 

There are people who think it's wrong to mandate masks or vaccines, but we don't think of them as part of the Covid skeptic movement, because they are not refusing to mask or get vaccines. 

The people who go out protesting these things, ultimately don't believe in the science behind vaccines and masks, so reasoning with them about civic responsibility is pointless. They reject the premise that widespread masking and vaccination, even if it was wrong to mandate, would be beneficial."
889,Withdrawal from Afghanistan. Was it done right?,"The United States has been processing these visas for years. Specific evacuation flights started last month, and thousands have already been relocated to the US. It's not that the government hasn't been doing it, it's just not enough to keep up with demand. Before recent events, it took about three years on average to get the visa. There's a ton of paperwork and security checks to get through. Obviously in recent months a bunch more people are applying, which has expanded the queue even more.

A more orderly evacuation was possible--but likely would have required the cooperation of Congress changing the laws on how many visas they allow. The Biden administration couldn't have done it singlehandedly.

In addition to that--a lot of the people in those chaotic airport scenes weren't people who qualified for the visa program in the first place. They were just random Afghans trying to escape the country. They may eventually make it out to another country (possibly the US, possibly not) as a refugee. But they were not going to be affected by the visa program, and it's unlikely the Biden administration could have done much to avoid the airport scenes that resulted from that."
890,25th Amendment: What happens to a VP nomination when the Senate is split 50/50?,"I live for moments of finding vulnerabilities in constitutional processes as written .  I'm amazed this never crossed my mind until now.  I too would really like to know what others find because I can't think of anything at the moment.  
Considering it halts a LOT of the process since the Senate would be functionally deadlocked for everything, I imagine many laymen will ask the supreme court to weigh in somehow, even though they probably shouldn't.  Whether the supreme court would try and influence anything is unlikely in my eyes, but still well within the realm of possibility."
891,What is the difference between all those different far-right movements?,"Strasserism refers to a faction within the early days of the Nazi party led by the Strasser brothers and represented the left-wing of the party.  In contrast to the ""right wing,"" Strasserists were explicitly pro-worker and wanted to base the Nazi party around mass action and radicalized workers instead of the pro-business policies that Hitler eventually enacted.  The faction was killed during the Night of Long Knives after years of feuding between the two factions."
892,Why don't Speakers of the House run for president?,"Speakers are not usually the among the most popular members of their party. Their job makes for lots of enemies outside their party and within. In addition, they only serve two-year terms, and would run the risk of becoming jobless should they not win.  This is also why current reps don't usually run. Senators and governors have longer terms, so they can time a run in the middle of their term."
893,How can we incentivize more long-term planning in democracies?,"> But the criticism that politicians are encouraged to focus more on short-term gains than long-term ones seems legit.

Dictators also tend to be short-term thinkers.  Dictators might not have to worry about elections but the career of a dictator is one little crisis after another."
894,How many constitutions around the world has the US written or directly influenced and how many of those Constitutions are still active today?,"It's a bit hard to answer this question. I mean, before the US, there wasn't even a concept of a constitution at all in government. When the French Revolution kicked off right after the US won the war, US delegates did help them craft a constitution...but that was then abandoned shortly after the Revolution turned into the Terror. But the French Revolution was arguably the most significant international event of the century, and from that point forward, constitutions became a central point of government organization, even to the point that folks will assert they can exist in even *unwritten* form.

And then fast forward to the modern era. When WW2 ended and Ho Chi Minh was frustrated with French colonial rule and wanted independence for French Indochina, he approached Truman by appealing to the words of Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence to implore him to use the UN to help Vietnam secure independence. The US turned him down.

The point is that it's almost impossible to answer this question definitively. What we can say is that the American Revolution was a major catalyst in the French Revolution, and the French Revolution changed the world, and in the modern era, constitutions are a staple of democratic governments. You could make an argument that the existence of any constitution at all comes in part from American influence, even if you don't have a direct tie between, for example, Brazilian officials and the US Constitution."
895,Has the politics of recognition and self determination influenced the tradition criterion of statehood in the post cold war era?,"Somewhat. Nationalism has gone hand in hand with the independence movements of the 20th century, notably with purported communist revolutions (Vietnam), the former colonies of what was the British Empire (Nigeria) and the dissolution of socialist regimes in the '80s and '90s (Yugoslavia). However, as smaller and smaller regions and ethnic groups demand their sovereignty, the emphasis on nation-states comes into conflict with the international community's preference for territorial integrity (the UN usually wants states and their borders to be remain fixed). States as entities have staying power, and leaders can offer semiautonomy to minorities rather than engage in costly wars or suffer loss of territory (locally-administered Northern Ireland)."
896,What is a better way to get my voice heard by a local representative besides writing a letter?,"Go to their hometown office when Congress is in recess and camp out in the waiting area.

897,Which modern constitutional monarchies are the most involved in the governance?,"Jordan is a constitutional monarchy where the king has lots of power. The Senate is appointed by the King of Jordan, but the constitution sets rules on who can be on the Senate (government veterans so people with experience). He also can declare war, dissolve parliament, postpone elections, and appoints a Prime Minister and government (although on the last one he does it every 4 years, and Parliament can dismiss the Prime Minister if they don't agree with the choice or performance)."
898,why do you think that politics is *not* a good career option?,"From the campaign side perspective.

899,"What relations, if any, does China have with Afghanistan, and how will the Taliban take over impact their sliver of shared border?","There is practically no infrastructure in the Wakhan Corridor, and the borders there between Afghanistan, India, and China are disputed.  The terrain is very rough and mountainous.  It thus does not serve as a practical route for transporting things.  It was never meant to anyway.  That panhandle was created not to give Afghanistan a border with China, but to create a buffer zone between the Russian Empire and the British Empire (this happened back in 1893).  The Russians couldn't send troops into India without also intruding on Afghan territory.

Afghanistan has vast mineral deposits and I'm sure the Taliban will sell some of that stuff to China.  The minerals won't get transported through the Wakhan Corridor because that region is too mountainous and underdeveloped, so they'll probably go through Tajikistan instead."
900,"How does mass infrastructure spending help politicians get votes?

901,Why should I care about a balanced budget?,"The economic idea behind a balanced budget is to prevent runaway deficit spending and potential inflation caused by high deficit spending, and to keep investors who buy government debt through treasury securities confident that they will be paid back. This also allows greater leeway for the nation to deficit spend when the next recession hits. 

But the most ardent supporters of balanced budgets also have an ideological goal in mind. Balanced budgeting can be a tool to limit spending and the size of the government and to prevent deficit spending which would require future taxation to pay off. 

Most economists will tell you that balanced budgets aren't always good. In times of recession, deficit spending allows the state to stimulate the economy while delaying taxation or spending cuts in other areas that would reduce the efficacy of the stimulus. The inflationary pressure of deficit spending is also curbed by the downward pressures on the economy caused by recession.  

Do we need a balanced budget right now? No. The economy is in a period of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now is when deficit spending is the most useful.

The big debate going on right now isn't about balancing the budget, but if we are spending too much. The United States has a great level of debt already and skeptics of the dollar amount of recent spending bills like Larry Summers have warned that we may be overheating the economy and heading toward an inflation spike that would devalue the stimulus. 

Others, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, believe inflation won't continue at its current pace and will eventually subside as supply shortages end."
