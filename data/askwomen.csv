I feel utterly fantastic and wishes I'd done it years ago!"
1,"Women who are now single after being in a loving relationship, how do you go to sleep every night with no one next to you for warmth?","This is why we have pets and stuffies.

Real answer. I'm leaving a relationship where we did love each other once. And I'm fucking looking forward to having the space to myself.

My decision was solidified when I recalled a previous conversation with my then boyfriend saying that he'd love to ""own"" me by getting me pregnant."

And yes, I've confirmed that it really says that and not 'Pork Bao' or whatever as the clich√© goes.) Not the worst, but extremely Basic White Girl."

My uncle worked aboard icebreaking ships with the Canadian Coast Guard for most of his career, and I've heard a lot of stories about it.  A wooden ship  up there  is a fucking bad idea. I've got no interest in starring in a sequel to the Franklin expedition, thanks."
13,"Women who knew they were going to marry their SO soon after meeting them, what was that like? What made the encounter/them different?","I met my fiance at the beginning of my divorce. I was honest and told him I really just needed a friend right then. Boy, did he step up. Anytime I needed him, he was there. He would stop by with dinner for my kids and I, grab groceries (my ex husband left with our only vehicle) and drop them off, take me to appointments, I'd sit up all night and listen to him vent about life and work, we'd watch horror movies together, etc. One night I needed him, it was really bad, and he left work to come sit with me. During all this time we were strictly platonic. We talked about everything, and I never felt I had to censor my history with him. I also never judged him for anything he told me. 


One day, after he took my kids to a bunch of Goodwills (we love book bargains), my oldest hugged him before going inside. My ex-husband had hit my oldest, that's what ended the marriage, I pressed charges. So that was huge. That was when I knew we were safe with him, that I wasn't just seeing what I wanted to see. Later that night, at dinner, the kids started asking if he and I were together. When we told them we were just friends, they immediately asked, ""Why not?"" We looked at each other, laughed, went back to eating with everyone. It must have gotten us both thinking, because we started dating later that week and just celebrated our 5 year anniversary today!"

16,"Women who had to choose between a job and passion project, how did you go about making the decision?","Made a pro/con list and a potential success/regret list to help me think through all of the possibilities, determined which choice was most logical to me, and then did a gut-check pretending if I made that decision to see if I felt any immediate regret or buyer's remorse at that choice. If I did or wasn't sure, then I examined that further to figure out what was concerning me so I could add it to the overall deliberation. After going through this iterative process, I've always felt settled and content with the choices I've made regardless of how it eventually worked out in reality."
17,"How has it affected your life to be in a relationship with someone whose fam yells and argues or is mean, assuming you have a great fam?","It makes me sad to see my boyfriends family treat him like garbage. Only ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù when they need something and then my family is just a bunch of awesome people who hangout all the time. It does suck and it has created boundaries we‚Äôve had to talk about like if we have a kid who would be able to see it, who we‚Äôd invite to the wedding etc."

20,What conversation happened with your partner that really opened up your relationship to the next level of connection?,"I told him I wanted couples counseling because nothing we had tried was fixing our issues.

We had thought we were great communicators before that, but it turns out were weren't. We were always telling each other how we felt, but not understanding what the other person was saying. Counseling helped us learn how to *actually* support each other through difficult conversations and we have never had a healthier relationship. Next up is figuring out how to get out of a sexual rut, so we're talking about counseling again 3 years after our first round."

ü•π yes you are baby, yes you are. sweet boy."
25,What is the first thing you do when you get home from an long trip?,"Apologize to the animals, long hot shower, unpack immediately (unless it‚Äôs late). I also change the sheets before I leave so they are fresh when I get home."
26,What are the signs that you are taken for granted?,"You fix a meal for someone, and you don't hear a thank you. Is the easy one

29,How much of a difference is there between turned on sex and just sex?,"Good question, and I'd like to add some granularity to this. Short answer: a lot.

**Not turned on and unconsenting**: Extremely bad. Rape.

**Not turned on but consenting**: Uncomfortable or meh, depending on lots of factors. Not good for my sexual or emotional health, so personally I won't consent to this.

**Turned on and consenting**: Can be nice or even clearly enjoyable, again depending on other things. An okay experience. Won't be bad for me per se, but I'm also not very keen to continue having sex with someone if the experience is on this level (especially outside of a relationship with clear growth potential).

**Properly aroused and enthusiastically consenting**: Physically and emotionally highly pleasant. Potential to reach orgasm. A great experience even without orgasm. Would go back for more.

**Extremely aroused and begging for it**: Magical and healing - an emotional and physical paradise. The reason why I love sex so much. Potential for multiple orgasms and altered mind states without any sort of drug use. A deeply bonding experience.

\*

As a guideline, research shows that *on average*, women need at least 30 minutes of foreplay in order to get properly aroused. That means many of us need longer than that."
30,"Women, how often do you think about the Roman Empire?",seeing this trend on tiktok was so funny to me because i don‚Äôt think i have thought about the roman empire in YEARS lmao
31,How do you know when a long-term partner is stringing you along when it comes to marriage?,"If I can't have a conversation about time lines and a shared future together with them, it's probably not going to work long term."

33,When did you stop plucking out grey hairs?,I never started. I have a Rogue streak and I absolutely fucking love it.
34,What made you realize that they were only dating you for status/clout?,"None of these got to the relationship point.. 

But a guy who was into me basically just kept focusing on my sex appeal.. then me/my parents‚Äô money. Like I get falling for my looks, but the way he then got incredibly interested when he realised my background was gross.

Had another few that IMO were mainly into me because my background would suggest a certain financial stability/status and also comes with certain stereotypes associated with promiscuity, cute/princess personality, and maybe slight status. 

Again you tell by where they fixate. You know when you‚Äôre talking to a person and their face lights up if you bring up with no.1 passion/hobby?? It was like that. It gives you a huge ick. Like whyTF did you just perk up finding out this info? 

I‚Äôll add.. I‚Äôm very private/cagey about my background. But my accent/fluency in English and ethnic background (ie things I really can‚Äôt change/hide for the most part) basically would reveal it. The only reason some might not notice straight away is is because girls here pretend to have this accent, to be foreign/mixed etcetc.. To me, it‚Äôs (obvious) who is pretending or not, but I guess many local guys might not as easily know."
35,How did you overcome of fear of divorce when your partner is actually good person and you have fear that you maybe regret divorce?,You don‚Äôt. If you fear regret than a divorce is probably not a reasonable option
36,"Women who grew up going to sleep away camp every year, how was the experience?","Oh my god, the most fun, the most most fun! A whole week every summer filled with swimming, hiking, camping, songs, laughter, bugs, sunshine, Gaga. Such good memories. And then I was a camp counselor in college. Yes, my kids will definitely go to sleep away camp!"
37,How did your friends support you during your divorce?,"They didn't. The ones who were aware of it due to proximity were part of a large friend group I went no contact with entirely due to their actions and behaviors during my divorce. For the rest, I didn't tell them until it was final, so they weren't involved during the process of it.

Edit: To clarify, they weren't against my divorce, but they took advantage of it either to hit on me themselves or to try to bully, coerce, and manipulate me into a relationship with two of the people in the friend group. I cut them all out of my life instead."
38,What was that one moment that changed your whole perspective about life or brought a big personality shift?,"Not getting my dream job after so much hardwork and seeing someone else get it with almost no effort. I learnt life is unfair and sometimes you need luck on your side, not just hardwork."
39,"ladies, what did you do when you noticed a close friend always copying your style?",Imitation is the finest form of flattery as they say. I took it as a compliment and moved on.

Not even a second, and he corrected ""*we* design"".

&#x200B;

I know this is something he wants to do.. I don't know if it's really big enough to call it his dream, it was kinda a small dream of mine to see him create something... it was really moved he included me in his/my dream, and it was kinda the first definite confirmation he actually included me in such a big way in his future. I honestly would've been very happy to see him make/create whatever he wanted."
43,"How do you set boundaries in your relationships? (work, strangers, friends, etc...)","I'm married, so all the friends I have know that things are platonic. No need for special boundaries. And in the relationship with my husband, we're both equally loyal and monogamous, so there's no boundaries about meeting with platonic friends, coworkers etc. 

We trust each other, and don't have any reason not to."
44,What is the worst representation of menstruation you‚Äôve seen in a movie or television?,"There was a male author who wrote in a book that the woman only had her period for 45 minutes.

We all wish that was the truth."
45,What's your 'its always darkest before the dawn' story?,No idea but I'm sure hoping for a dawn soon.
46,What are your thoughts on true crime?,"I have a friend whose sister was murdered. It was high profile and the amount of speculation around his family was an additional layer of trauma. There‚Äôs wild speculation on the internet that‚Äôs close to fan fiction, but about real innocent people. It‚Äôs horrible and I won‚Äôt be a part of it."
47,Casual Convo Fridays,"Mosquito season is in full swing and for whatever reason these little things seem to love my right leg; I have five bites there and maybe two elsewhere. :p

49,"Women with avoidant personalities, how are you doing?",Scrolling reddit to avoid my life
50,"Women of Reddit, what did you do to fall in love with yourself?","It sounds silly but I really started being more intentional on being connected with my body. I started playing music to dance around my house, and started cooking to taste and smell more things and learn more. I just started really embracing myself like all those ‚Äúself help‚Äù saying things do but in my own way. I started paying attention to my face and every spot on it when I washed it in the morning and kept looking until I loved it. And people really did start telling me I was glowing."
51,How have you discovered that the grass is in fact greener on the other side?,Ive discovered that no person would treat ANYONE the way they did me if they cared even a little bit. I was right
52,"How old do YOU think is too old, for someone you‚Äôre dating to have roommates?",The Golden Girls seemed to keep up pretty active dating lives. So I guess the number is somewhere above their ages.
53,How would you feel about a close friend dating an ex from a serious relationship?,I will feel very hurt and betrayed. That's not what true friends do. I will cut them off forever.
54,"Women who have taken hydrolyzed collagen, how was your experience?","I put some in my coffee every day and it‚Äôs been about five months. My knee that always pops during yoga hasn‚Äôt popped in weeks, my skin looks great, my nails are strong. It takes a few months to really see results. For me it‚Äôs worth it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
55,"If a friend stays the night at your house, how long can they hang around the next day before you want them to leave?","I always set expectations in advance.

58,What do you do on solo dates?,Go to the movies! I‚Äôll never understand why people don‚Äôt like going alone. It‚Äôs not like you can socialise in there anyway and you can byo yummy snacks. I‚Äôll never miss out on seeing a movie if friends aren‚Äôt available again. Same as gigs. No shame in taking yourself out on a hot movie or band date.
59,"Women who struggle with keeping friends, how did you get better at it?","If I ever figure out the answer, I'll let you know."
60,What are your superstitions?,"I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious."
61,Why did you remain kind despite it all?,"Because I know what it's like to not be met with kindness of any kind, and I don't want to be the reason that someone feels like so many other people deliberately have made me feel."
62,Women who entered into long term relationship before their 20's and have been in relationship their whole twenties. How are you now? Do you feel like you missed out something?,"Technically, I had just turned 20 a little bit before we started dating.  I'm 38 now.  I don't feel like I missed out on anything.  I am thankful that I was lucky enough to meet the love of my life so early on.  We've built a wonderful life together and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes next."
63,Women who are more extroverted than their partner. What do you do when you‚Äôre out of sync?,"Im just bubbly and all up in my feelings. It kinda pours out of me. High highs, low lows. It‚Äôs not that he‚Äôs introverted or extroverted, he‚Äôs just a man of few words, very direct, and is more of a listener. He kinda absorbs information, but if asked or your focus shifts to him, he‚Äôll open up and chat away. People tend to think he‚Äôs in a bad mood but that‚Äôs his normal stoic gaze. Probably why he doesn‚Äôt have a single wrinkle on his face. I bring the laughter and smiles out of him, others, not so much."
64,What are your tips for getting a good night‚Äôs sleep?,"No booze, exercise, go to bed at the same time every night."

68,"What are your thoughts on people who use dating apps to ""look for friends?""","If the app has a ""looking for friends"" category you can pick, go for it. But I don't think people looking for friends should try to match people who are clearly there for dating. I'm tired of sifting through people in my feed who obviously aren't looking for the same thing as me and who shouldn't have liked my profile in the first place."
69,What happened in your relationship that made you realize you deserved better?,It was more like ‚Äòwhat didn‚Äôt happen‚Äô that made me realize
70,Why don't you just only buy clothes with pockets?,"It can be hard to find clothes that fit well, look good, don't cost too much and also have pockets. Personally I have trouble finding correctly fitting pants so I'm willing to sacrifice having pockets when I find a pair that fits well. Most pockets are pretty small anyway."
71,How long do your eyebrows last when you wax/pluck until you have to do it again?,"I have been plucking with tweezers for years. I have what I call ""the devil mirror."" It's 10x zoom and sees everything you don't want to see.

74,What concerns/demand/complain/expectation do you have about men who love video games?,"Video games are no different from other hobbies in this regard; as long as it's not so much of an obsession that they're frequently ignoring me in favor of it, dropping the ball on their responsibilities, etc. then it doesn't matter. I play video games too ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
75,What would you put into a care package for a friend/family member who's in hospital?,"Definitely get them a bunch of things to read, books, magazines, comics, whatever. Puzzle books or interactive mystery books if they enjoy those. When I was admitted I almost had a full mental breakdown from how stressed and frustrated I was just watching streams and staring at my phone all day long. Getting to hold a real book or comic and read actual pages did so much for my psyche that I never could have imagined it would.

A fan is probably welcome to, the air in there can get so stale and stuffy. A lip balm and hand lotion, snacks if they're allowed to, maybe some cleansing wipes and a dry shampoo if their ability to shower and wash are limited?"
76,What is your proudest moment?,"Graduating college with honors (highest average in my class) even though I worked full time through most of it.

I went to a *very* expensive university with a scholarship, that meant I had to leave home (college housing isn't a thing here) and work my ass off to afford rent and food and everything else, while still maintaining good grades. The vast majority of my classmates had everything covered by their parents, never had to work and still lived at home. It was incredibly hard, but so worth it."
77,What is your biggest concern when it comes to health or access to healthcare as a woman?,"Doctors tend to not take women's health issues as seriously as they do men's. Especially POC women. It's waved off as just being dramatic, drug seeking behavior, or related to periods somehow, regardless whether or not the woman gets periods."
78,What would you like your SO to do to better 'maintain the relationship'?,Win the lottery so we could retire immediately
79,"What is your reaction to guy saying ""You're prettier without makeup""?",‚ÄúBold of you to assume you‚Äôve seen me without makeup‚Äù.
80,What is the most annoying thing about wearing cosmetics?,"Not knowing if it's right for me until after I've paid good money. 

Looking at you, expensive ""dry touch, anti-shine, oil-free"" La Roche Posay sunscreen that makes me look like a puddle of grease."
81,What surprised you when you and your partner started Living together?,"For a very tidy independent man, he left a lot of socks everywhere. Socks on the sofa, socks on the bedside table, socks outside the bathroom door, under the dining table. He cleans, does the dishes, picks up after himself except for socks. It's like as soon as they are off his feet, he can't see them anymore."
82,"Women of reddit, what's the best birthday letter you ever received from your s/o?","Y‚Äôall get birthday letters from your SO? 

brb gonna go start a fight (jkjk)"
83,What are some signs that a platonic friendship might be evolving into something more?,You will start hearing violins in the background... saw it in some Indian movie
84,What's your opinion about a straight guy wearing a dress just for fun?,For me it is a huge turn on and here is why: it shows confidence. It shows that he is a man grounded in his identity. He is not insecure.
85,"Women who are married, how long did it take for your partner to fall in love with you?","My SO said he knew when we met. We just had this energy. Two months later, he was sleeping over at my house, and he rolled over in the middle or the night and said, ""I love you so much."" He woke up the next morning and was like, ""I had a dream that I told you I love you."" And I said,""That wasn't a dream, I love you, too.""  The rest is history. We are planning our wedding for the fall of next year."
86,"What is a ""dirty little secret"" about an industry that you have worked in, that people outside the industry really should know?","In the publishing industry, bestselling books are created by networks of people, not by the quality of the book. A space on a bookshop table or in the shop's sales chart is paid for by the publisher. Very little success is based on the book itself ‚Äì it's based on the right people buying into the idea of making it a success."
87,How do you handle a new friend wanting to be in touch more often than you do?,"I let them know that I like them and enjoy hanging out with them, but that I'm not in a place in life where I have the time and energy to see people as often as they maybe would like. I'd again reiterate that it's not about them, and if possible I'd love to try to meet them halfway; Maybe we could voice chat more often, or see each other less often but for longer days? But I won't do it the exact way they ask for and it's a firm boundary, as it's about my health and well-being.

This is assuming they're not coming off as clingy or needy though, because at that point idc if I like them, I'm out."
88,What is your favorite thing about weddings?,Partying with people I haven't seen in ages
89,What do you do for a living and what are the best and worst tasks you have to perform at your job?,Working at a toy-store for kids. Best thing: interacting with customers. Worst: interacting with customers

93,What is your relationship with clothes?,"Addictive, lol. I love clothes, I love creating outfits, but I've never used over half of all the clothes I own, and I own *a lot*. They always come to use sooner or later as I'm not obsessed with trends and will wear most stuff long after they've gone out of fashion, but it's still a huge money pit.

I live in a small town and have to mostly online shop for clothes, so I haven't ran into that particular issue where nothing fits."
94,What is your story in life?,"TL;DR: Was born, got depressed, stayed depressed lmao

My life's just been uneventful as fuck. Grew up in two countries, was depressed for being bullied and ostracized, kept being depressed as an adult it turns out people don't necessarily mature with age. Dropped out of school and moved away at 16 to be independent, tried different fields of work, moved countries a couple of times, travelled to even more, and basically just tried finding something, someone and somewhere that could make me feel normal, happy and content, but it never happened. Now I'm middle-aged, even more mentally ill than before, and just trying to get through each day."
95,What was the most regretful thing you did while trying to play hard to get?,[removed]
96,"Women of reddit, when and how did you realize that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with your S.O.?","After our first road trip together.

That hasn't changed."
97,"What do you consider ""sleeping naked""?","If I am naked and sleeping, I would consider myself to be sleeping naked."
98,When have you watched a movie or TV show and realized that the writer(s) were men?,"Most of the time when a beautiful woman is attracted to an average looking man, or a young woman is attracted to a much older man, I know the writer is male. There has been a refreshing trend towards casting actresses who are closer in age to the male characters, which I appreciate."
99,"Divorced Women of Reddit, what did you do to fill your new free time?",Spend too much time on Redditüò≠
100,"What do you think of the ""women are biologically submissive"" argument?",That argument never seems to come from biologists

102,What‚Äôs a romantic ‚Äúmovie moment‚Äù you‚Äôve experienced in a relationship?,"Love at first sight with my man. He walked into the room, and we stared at each other for what felt like an eternity. I'll never forget that feeling."
103,"Women who have divorced, what are some things you wish you'd have done before the final split?","This is a bit farther back than the final ""split"" but the decision to divorce happened so fast. I was living my life as if I had all the time in the world to pay my debts off. I was in a solid middle-class two income household so there was no imminent need, right? Well now I'm grappling with my finances and buying a new (smaller) house in this shitty economy. I guess my warning is that if you're unhappy and wanting to fix things, actually consider that they can't be fixed and your reality could change quickly. Prepare and save money in a personal account!"

106,What‚Äôs the dumbest thing you‚Äôve been told about menstruation?,"That we can hold it. 

OR the one where a whole period is allegedly one tablespoon of liquid. Lmao I've had individual clots that would fill a tablespoon, but sure."
107,"Women with spouses having food allergies, how do you (or don't ) cope with the different lifestyle?","My hubby has Celiac and it isn't a huge issue honestly. I've become much more of a squeaky wheel when going out when I suspect something that should be GF isn't (wrong bun, etc) and I'm always open to talking to the chef/manager/whoever to get it safe for him. I look over menus for options and items that can be changed w/o issue (like, grilled chicken instead of fried, etc) He was very embarrassed about it when we first started dating and I almost killed him on our second date because he hadn't told me, lol! I switched over my kitchen early on into the relationship and overall it only increased our grocery budget maybe 20% due to the priciness of GF goodies. I'll bring snacks and alternatives for him when needed (theme parks and the like) and I'm now as expert at reading labels. Watching cooking shows also helped me learn more of how certain sauces are made so it's nice to have that nugget of information in my brain to know what cannot be adjusted so we can just ignore that item and go for something else. I also love love love to cook so it helps with the allergy knowledge and now he can have items safely w/o worry, I just love to see him happy!"

110,"Women of Reddit, for what reasons were you bullied as a kid?","Being ""too smart"". It makes me sad seeing so many women with this same response. 
BUT I have another weird reason: 
 One girl in middle school bullied me because we had the same name and apparently this was Highlander and there could only be one. I barely knew her. Never had a class with her. Had no idea why she picked me as her victim. Found out later through a mutual friend that she had a huge crush on my brother, and he turned her down because he felt weird dating someone with the same name as his sister. So the bullying began and lasted for a year .... it was awful. She and her friends made me miserable. She asked him out again in highschool and was absolutely shook that she got turned down again. ""Why the **** would I go out with someone who bullied my sister so bad?""
It's been 20 years. I STILL think about it sometimes...."
