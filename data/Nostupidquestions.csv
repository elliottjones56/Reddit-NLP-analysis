0,"If Germany calls itself Deutschland, why don't we call it that? Same for all other countries, why not pronounce their native names?","It’s called “*exonyms*”.

Germany is a tricky one, because it was the name that the Roman Empire gave to that area. But the very people didn’t call themselves that.

However, remote places kept the reference to the Roman name. And adding that until 250 years ago the fastest way you could travel was on a horse, people stuck with a lot of exonyms, letting them be cemented into language long before we had more direct communication."

3,what’s the most offensive thing you’ve ever seen sold and were there any repercussions?,"This isn't super offensive like some suggestions I've seen, but shortly after Star Wars Episode 1 came out is saw some disturbing merch: a JarJar Binks candy sucker. It had a plastic JarJar head and you would push a plunger to make the head split open wide at the mouth and, apparently, suck on the tongue-shaped candy.

6th grade me thought: ""What the *actual* fuck?""

There was indeed some outrage, that item wasn't sold long but it wasn't a newsworthy scandal."
4,If WWIII kicks off would nuclear missiles be shot down over water (given enough time) and/or would nukes be dropped as bombs like WWII?,ICBMs fly into space.  No pilot is going to shoot them down.
5,Explain like I’m 5… how do I shower correctly,"You may need some clinical antiperspirant.  That isn't unusual.

Speak to your Dr."
6,My orthodontist always calls me a good girl is this weird?,"Orthodontist? Is this while getting braces tightened? He may just be used to younger kids moaning bc it hurts 

I am a very hard needle stick, the number of times I've been told 'good girl' and been patted throughout my life after an especially hard time I can't count. 


Sometimes it's someone trying to show empathy or encouragement.

Just speak to him about it. If it continues beyond that,  file a complaint."
7,What exactly am I supposed to be looking at when watching women belly dancing or other forms of erotic dances?,Look at everything at once or any specific thing. Whatever you like. You're supposed to be staring.
8,What happens to the foreskin during sex?,">does the foreskin go in or bunch up at the base

As a man, reading this was very painful.

no, the foreskin retracts to show the glans, but it doesn't go any further, so it remains around the neck of the glans, and yes it does go in."
9,Why is it close to impossible for a new Reddit account to participate on this platform?,Just browse a while. I have a month and have 7oo points. Just installed for a legal  question but there are some interesting subs. By the way is there an index or something with a description of the subreddits? Each day I learn about an interesting sub but I would like to have an index or something.
10,Why the fuck is cling wrap smaller than a a standard dinner plate?,"So you have to use another piece or two to cover it completely, using more wrap making you buy another roll sooner."
11,Is it ok to fantasize about ex gf after a toxic breakup?,I don’t think it’s “not ok” it’s just fantasizing. My ex was posting the same stuff
12,"As a male employee who cleans the women’s restroom, what’s the least awkward way to make sure it’s empty before I enter?","Knock on the door and say ""Cleaning guy coming through! Anyone in there?"""
13,Is it weird to hit on a bartender?,"Just remember that the bartender is at her JOB and is trapped there, while you're on your free time. Give her the option/ability to contact you one day if she's interested, but respect her workspace."
14,How do I remove the poop smell from a bathroom immediately?,Everybody poops. Nobody will think you're a weirdo for pooping.
15,Why do people seem to love to Florida so much?,It's supposed to be hot. Most people go down there to wear sandals and take clothes off.
16,Is it embarrassing to order one meal for two people in a restaurant?,waiters always give me judgmental looks when I order two meals for one person.   but I don't care.
17,Can someone who's practicing Hinduism eat beef if they're starving?,"I’m Hindu. 

Short answer is yes you can eat beef in such a situation. There is a concept we practice called ahimsa which means “non violence”. Ahimsa is where the idea of vegetarianism comes from in our faith. 

However “violence” is allowed in situations of self defense etc. that is the exact moral dilemma Arjun faces in the Bhagavad Geetha. Arjuna was an ancient king who was faced with the moral dilemma of killing his own evil brothers. The Bhagavad Geetha is a conversation between God (Krishna) and king Arjun about this moral dilemma. Basically God tells Arjun he must follow his Dharma and sometimes commit violence to prevent harm to others. 

Eating beef to survive is similar to self defense. 

There’s a good section on non-human life here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa"

21,When did pitbulls become so evil? When I was growing up it was rottweilers that were the most terrifying dog. What happened?,"Past 5 years? They've been banned in the UK since 1991, this isn't a sudden new thing."

23,How do americans afford uber?,"We don’t use Uber as an everyday thing, just special occasions where you really need it."

25,"If Justin Bieber hates the fame so much, why does he keep performing?",He signed contracts. He can't stop now
26,Has anyone else just accepted that retirement is just not a possibility?,I'm pretty sure I will have to work a half day on the day of my funeral.
27,"Why do people put the ""In memory of"" stickers on their cars?",Where I live the stickers are sold to friends and family and the proceeds are used toward the funeral costs because the deceased person is young and the family didn't have any plans in place for burial.
28,Sober People - What do you order at the bar?,Soda water and lime was always my go-to.  I actually like the way it tastes and I find it very thirst quenching.  I never saw anyone roll their eyes or heard any comments about it.

31,"Why do people say ""Quote Un-Quote"" and THEN say the thing that is the quote?",It's supposed to be used when you're only quoting one word
32,Why don’t households have water fountains?,What does  a water fountain do that can't be accomplished with a sink?
33,What to when someone owes you money but won’t pay you?,"Let him know that you are really needing that money back ASAP. If it does not happen within the next week, then yes I would cut him off, especially if you already had reasons to do it anyway. Money should not make or break friendships but with all my friends they have paid me back exactly when they told me they would after borrowing money, so I personally have not had this problem before."
34,how can i kindly say i don't wanna have sex with someone after we already took off some/all of our clothes?,"It's impossible to clearly communicate this boundary without hurting their feelings. Just be honest and deal with the fallout. 

To avoid this, I personally try not to have sex the very first time we see each other naked, more work your way up to that with a ""second base"" date so you can see what you're working with before getting to that point"
35,"How did the song ""Makeba"" by Jain become Instafamous suddenly?","""Makeba"" by Jain is surging in popularity thanks to a TikTok trend featuring Bill Hader. 

https://www.insider.com/how-miriam-makeba-inspired-viral-tiktok-meme-dance-2023-7

The same way the 80s song Running Up That Hill by Kate Bush was shot back to the top of the charts after it was used in one scene of Stranger Things."
36,Is everyone getting spammed with dm's from onlyfans chicks?,Yep. Not every day though
37,Are there ways a man can masturbate to completion without stroking his dick?,Massage your prostate.
38,Why do girls comment on other girls’ posts so much?,">guys don’t seem to validate each other

Ever notice all the lonely men with no close human connections?"
39,going long periods of time without verbally taking. Have you ever done that? for how long? is it a bad thing?,"Are you having trouble with other things like sleeping/bathing/eating? In other words, are you depressed? Self-isolation is a very common symptom of clinical depression. What’s the rest of your life like?"
40,Why does Reddit have so many troll posts even though this site is anonymous?,"two reasons come to mind. one, it's entertainment, for the reader or the writer. two, the writer has an agenda they want to push, and the story (in theory) advances that agenda in people's mind if it is believed. the ""down with cis bus"" story comes to mind although that's not from this site."
41,Why do people on the internet say that people with large age gaps “have nothing in common?”,"Yeah I think you're misinterpreting it. It's not about having common interests, it's about the stage of life you're in. You can be friends at pretty much any age, especially adults. Relationships though, building a life with someone requires you to be on the same ground mentally. A 28 year old is in a significantly different place in their life than an 18 year old, but a 45 year old is more likely to be in a similar place as a 55 year old."
42,Am I crazy or do I have zero self respect?,"No. You're just human and you made some mistakes. More than that, you're dealing with an emotional abuser, they twist and distort things and I have no doubt that he did that to you as well.

It's not your fault, at the end of the day, he did what he did. He knew it, and did it anyway. 

 You should however, consider getting help both for your addictions and your mental health. People like him love to exploit people that have vulnerabilities. That's the sort of people abusers target, because they love to control."
43,Is it weird that I don't like and don't identify with my culture?,I’m more a citizen of the internet than my country. I don’t think it’s weird I think it’s just your lifestyle
44,What do people mean by you're born alone and you die alone?,"I always understood it in a slightly less literal sense. You might be surrounded by people, friends, family, you may belong to a close community, but ultimately there is a limit, to which one can know and understand the other. In that sense each individual is alone in the entirety of their being and their experiences. You are born alone as an individual and you die alone as an individual."
45,is Gen z screwed?,"You shouldn’t want to buy a house at 18. That’s insanity. Stick with the parents or get some roommates and learn how that chaos works. 

I’m going to assume you’re American (as am I) and you’re conditioned to achieve all these things that define you’re success. They’re bullshit. The American dream isn’t real. It’s a way to force you into a life of consumerism and be the good little cow they can milk for money while you eat out of your feed bag. 

Stay at home if home life isn’t bad. Get through college or technical school. Save up money at a minimum.

Do you know how many Europeans stay living at home until they’re almost 30? Even in super serious relationships. They save up a ton of cash and then move out when they can put a huge sum down on a house or apartment and finally break off to start their lives together."
46,Do chocolates made by a professional confectioner differ from mass produced ones like Snickers?,"Yes, they taste better"
47,Is it possible for an extrovert to become an introvert?,Social anxiety perhaps? I was a huge extrovert up til about high school when I got randomly bombarded with anxiety and became more & more of an introvert. Maybe going into elementary was scary for kid you
48,Do you see yourself getting old?,"I'm 53.

I have been seeing myself ""get old"" since 27."
49,Are you actually inconvenienced by the actor/writer strike?,Forgot about it 5 minutes after it started.
50,Why do some people like eating ass?,Because it makes their/our partner feel good.
51,Why is men’s fashion so boring?,"It's not, it's just associated with homosexuality. What you understand to be men's fashion is just a bunch of dudes terrified of being called gay."
52,Is it true on OnlyFans when I message a girl it’s mostly a dude that manages multiple women’s accounts?,"I know a few content girls with managers, however the managers don't answer the inbox messages. But, I also know a few girls who have their boyfriends respond to the inbox messages. Most of them answer their own messages."
53,"Why is the URL for ""X"" still twitter.com and not x.com or something like that?",A rebranding like that takes a lot of planning and effort.
54,Why are you religious?,"I was born Orthodox Christian, became atheist, and then returned to Christianity when I had a moment of ""feeling"" faith for the first time in recogniseable way.

These days I live very much in religous way, and it benefits my life and people around me."
55,"Clowns are supposed to be funny, since when clowns became creepy and scary ?","Always? The clown look hasn't changed that much over the years, and I'm just as creeped out by pictures of old clowns as I am of pictures of modern clowns."
56,"If someone wants to fall asleep and they close their eyes, why can’t they fall asleep?",Their mind is running. They're restless. They don't feel good. Theyre stressed.
57,who was the person first decided that boys color is blue and girls is pink?,"Athanase Garnier, 1823 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_sources_for_pink_and_blue_as_gender_signifiers"
58,Why do scammers love Whatsapp?,"WhatsApp has about 2.7 Billion active users. 

SnapChat has  750 Million. 

Facebook Messenger has about 150 Million. 

If you wanted to run a scam where only 0.01% of the messages result in a successful scam, which platform would you pick?"
59,Does anyone else get a random horrific thought and have to physically shake their body to stop thinking about it?,"Sure, for me thought OCD + tic/tourette kind of thing

Professional help would probably help with that"
60,Why is a marriage proposal usually a surprise and not a discussion?,"It's not, or at least it shouldn't be.  The *timing* of a proposal can be a surprise, but the actual proposal itself should be the culmination of the relationship and shouldn't be a surprise."
61,Is it possible to have asthma without ever having an asthma attack?,Yes. Asthma bronchiale is a chronic inflammation of the airways of the lungs. Mild forms can go for years or indeed indefinitely without an attack. But rarely without any symptoms at all.
62,How often do you think about sex?,Daily.
63,Is there a left handed way to fold sheets?,"Same family situation. Mom was a lefty, I'm almost ambidextrous due to switching hands so often. Are you talking about fitted sheets? Because I cant imagine that a flat, square, top sheet would be no different no matter how its folded.

Edit: you should have told your girlfriend to flip it over and turn it around and then it would be the right way."
64,Did the US military establish no fly zones prior to 9/11?,"Yes. I used to fly to Vegas as a kid from Calgary, and it was a longer flight than it should have been because there was some sort of air base in the middle that the commercial planes couldn’t fly over"
65,"What to expect when dating a 66 year old, beautiful woman?","Unless you can find a redditor who has dated this specific woman, you're not going to get any useful answers here.

You're dating an individual, not an age group. You behave the way you would behave on any date."
66,Why is the British Empire demonized but the Roman Empire (among others) romanticized?,Of course we gotta romanticize the Romans. I mean the word romantic literally comes from them
67,Can you get a DUI if you're mowing your grass drunk?,"Where I am, the rule is if the device has internal motive effort. I.e., if it is a self-propelled or riding mower, you can get a DUI. However, you wouldn't for a purely mechanical push-mower. That being said, I'm sure the rules differ by location.

That being said, never operate machinery while intoxicated. You might not lose your freedom, but you could still lose your foot."
68,How much time should pass between asking someone out and the date itself?,"It should be sometime within a week. Probably on Friday or the weekend, but if it's something more casual you might go out after work or school."
69,How much cocaine do you think Ric Flair did in his prime wwe career?,ALL of it
70,Who ruined vampire lore?,"Bram Stoker's *Dracula* has its own strong sexual themes, but it is more restrained about expressing them. That was the norm for the era it was published in (1897 Victorian England)."
71,Why is (pig)-let only used for some words?,There is very little in the English language that is consistent and makes sense in all cases
72,Why do you hardly see the spouses of celebrities take their last names?,"Celebrities' names are their brand.  Changing it affects their brand. It happens, but not frequently.  Courtney Cox added ""Arquette""."
73,"When you were younger, what were some expectations you had about adulthood that ultimately went unfulfilled?",Being able to become anything I wanted
74,Anyone else struggle with personality tests?,Stop trying to think and just answer in 2 seconds.   You don't get to determine the outcome in life by gaming the challenges.
75,Why is it considered bad practice to make tea in the microwave?,It doesn't.  Some people just like doing things a certain way.
76,Would you install a tracking app (location) on your phone if your partner wants to check on you? Would you want to want to track them?,No and no.
77,Why do you need to be 21 in America to buy an alcohol drink but no other products containing alcohol,"Most things like that will get you sick before they get you drunk.

If you try to drink enough mouthwash to get drunk as a normal person you're going to have a very bad time."
78,What is the reasoning behind the removal of awards on Reddit?,"They didn't think it carried its weight, and the added visual and cognitive clutter didn't weigh up against the fun and income it brought."
79,What can I do to shower and brush teeth more frequently?,"Do it at the same time every day and tie it in with things that you enjoy. For example, only listen to a podcast or certain music that you like when doing this activities. You can also download apps for tracking daily activities. I really fun one that uses a video game model is Habitica. Everytime you complete a habit or goal you get experience points to help you fight monsters."
80,A guy who was in the same class as me when we were in elementary school (the first 5 years of school here) just messaged me and asked if I wanted to join a group chat with him and some people from back then. How do I politely tell him no?,Don't respond at all.
81,Why are diehard sports fans so irrational towards opposing fans and players?,Trust me when I say sports fans hate one certain player in their team more than anything else. More than opposition as well.
82,How much water would a citizen have to hoard for it to impact the local ecosystem enough to be noticed?,"Hi /u/AstroPop2023,

83,What do people think about when they are buying expensive designer things?,"A lot of cynical, non serious answers here so far. 

""This is better quality.""

""This will look perfect with my [item] at that [event].""

""Self care."" (Lol i know it's goofy but retail therapy is a thing)."
84,"If Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, where does the energy of the living go when they die?","It's heat and electrical energy, it dissipates into the environment.


There's no ""life energy"""
85,Would your 10 yo self be proud of you?,"I honestly don’t think that at 10 years old I had an concept of future me.  I was very much in the present. I think if we went to me when I got into my teens.  That’s s different story.   I think the only thing my 10 year old self would be disappointed about was my art.  I was born is with modicum of ability to draw, doodle and paint and at 10 it seemed really impressive to my family, classmates and friends.  Everyone was sure I would go into the arts (except my parents who wanted something stable ). But my abilities never matured and being an artist never came to pass."
86,"Anyone just love to talk to people over text or in person, but absolutely annoyed with phone calls?",I'm the complete opposite. I get annoyed exchanging a million texts - just pick up the damned phone.
87,Why does my loft apartment get warmer when it rains?,Does the temperature actually increase or does it just feel warmer? Typically more humid air will feel warmer.

You'd be way better off just filming it and suing the shit out of her."
90,Why does the food that I make in the airfrier tastes weird?,Maybe you're mistaking fish sticks for potatoes?
91,Why do people take multiple years of self defense courses instead of just weightlifting for a year and choke slamming any threat?,It doesn't really work like that. As a woman I'm petite so brute strength wouldn't help me much against a guy who is much bigger/taller than me. With martial arts and whatnot you can overpower someone who is bigger than you using smart techniques.
92,"Is it illegal to sell malware infected usb sticks for ""educational purposes"".",You think juries are idiots?
93,Health insurance in MA,"Have him contact his psychiatric provider, assuming he has a psychiatrist and not just a regular doctor prescribing his meds. I lost my insurance in July, and I’m on 4 different meds daily. An antidepressant, antipsychotic, BPD medication, and clonazepam for anxiety. I was freaking out because without these meds that I’ve been on for years I just knew something bad was going to happen if I didn’t have them. 

I went to my psychiatrist’s office and explained the situation and they gave me papers to fill out to continue to receive free appointments. I have to see the doctor for med management every 3 months because one of my meds are a controlled substance, so he can’t just give them to me without regular appointments. I still have to pay full price monthly at the pharmacy ($175) but the appointments themselves will be free of charge.

Edit to add that if I had to pay for the appointments themselves it would be an estimate of $800. We could pay it if absolutely necessary, but I’m glad I decided to go the route of at least checking on free options first."
94,What is the worst state to live in the United States?,"Really depends on your circumstances and demographics: your age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status."
95,How enjoyable is it to slander your coworkers and make their lives hell?,I would imagine the people who do this are not self aware. I bet they think they are the victim.
96,Is it safe to eat frozen vegetables that you microwaved in a bag you did not open and then stored in the refrigerator?,"How do they smell? Generally, yes it’s probably safe if it hasn’t been in the fridge too long"
97,What do you do when you sometimes miss your ex even after couple of years?,Nothing?
98,Is there a food item/chewable with the texture of skin??,Well… do you eat animal products?
99,Why can’t robots pass Captcha tests?,"The older style was distorted letters and numbers done in such a way that it was extremely difficult for image recognition software to figure out what it said.  Unfortunately technology has marched on and now software can complete them - it actually got to the point where the characters had to get so distorted actual humans were failing Captcha more frequently than robots!  Which is why you see the older style Captchas infrequently if at all.

The newer style, reCaptcha, uses a completely different method.  It looks at how you use the computer and internet.  That's why it's often a ""not a robot"" checkbox and nothing else.  It's looking at reaction times, how steady your mouse movements are, what kind of computer you're using, and even your browsing history (you agree to it by using the service, thank you google and overlybroad terms of use).  People and robots use computers very differently, even if the robot is designed to mimic how a person uses the computer.  If it's still not sure by the time you click the checkbox then you go to the ""click all squares containing.""  which gives it more chances to look at how the computer is being used to determine if it's a person or not.

And while google is cagey about how it all actually works, for obvious reasons, I'm also reasonably confident you're also training their image recognition engine at the same time."
100,Why do people cheer for college football teams they have no relation to?,"Because it's fun, and perhaps you like the coach, their history, etc. Or it could be the team closest to whatever city you live in.

Or, of course, the school you went to might have a really shitty football program."
101,"Do you think children should be featured in commercials and packages? If yes or no, why?",Yes. No reason not to.
102,Are there women who are addicted to masturbation?,Yes obviously there are
103,Which specific type of speaker can handle brown noise at a high volume without blowing out the speaker?,"Love some brown noise, sorry though I don’t have a answer."
104,Why do bar soaps smell weird and kinda bad when I wash my groin with it?,"I know what you're talking about, but I don't know why the weird odor happens."
105,"Morticians of Reddit, What is the psychological impact when you embalm Children, Teens, Or the Elderly?","Hi /u/GrassDry1295,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us.

106,What would happen if the US went back on the gold standard?,"Well, the first thing is that either every single dollar would suddenly be worth way less, or there'd have to be many, many fewer dollars available in the economy. The US does not own much gold. That alone would send the economy into a tailspin.

From there, there's no way to know exactly what would happen (assuming the gold standard is committed to). Probably some countries would ask for the gold value of all the dollars they currently hold. Probably some countries would go into sympathetic economic downturns. A lot of people would probably die unnecessarily due to the knock-on consequences.

I think this would be bad."
107,Why are gender pronouns a huge deal in US/Canada while the rest of the world couldn't care less?,are they really? I've only ever witnessed them as a thing online.
108,"If I don't ask my girlfriend out for a date, she'd never ask me out, what should I do?","Tell her, not reddit."
109,"I'm a landlord of a property that I own, thinking about raising rent $1,000 come next year's lease. Is there anything the tenant can do to refute this?",You need a lawyer to answer your real estate law questions in your jurisdiction.
110,Best way to learn cooking for a complete beginner ?,Watch Alton Brown’s “Good Eats” to learn techniques and science behind cooking reactions to learn fundamentals that can be applied to many dishes.
111,why are people with tattoos seen as intimidating?,Coz they’re usually hot
112,This Boebert story makes me want to ask why people even want to be famous?,"Fame often comes with money, and everyone wants more money."
113,Why are the subregions of Europe so much smaller than the subregions of all the other continents?,Isn't this question directly contrary to the name of the sub reddit?
114,my man has a sex list but won’t let me see it,"Hi /u/Realistic-Access4333,

115,What’s the equivalent of “sober” when it comes to weed and drug?,Sober.
116,Why don't we breed the anxiety out of cheetahs?,"First you would have to find cheetahs that already have that trait to breed with. If nobody has such a cheetah already, we are far from having the genetic knowledge to synthesize a trait that doesn't already exist."
117,"[SERIOUS] Why does this subreddit, and a lot of Reddit in general, jump so quickly to “you should divorce/break up with that person”?",People present misery and do nothing about it. Experienced people suggest the most common solution that may have worked for them.
118,Dumb physics question,"The weight of the whole thing would still be 276 in the second situation.

The resistance band pulls *you* up with 25 lbs of force by pulling *down* on the bar it’s attached to with 25lbs of force, so the pull-up bar is still ultimately holding it all up."
119,"Who wins the fight, an African wild dog versus an American Pitt Bull Terrier?",Wild dog due to climate
120,Is it normal that for overuse of Reddit to lead to feelings of despair?,"Yes, any social media really."
121,Are dating apps a good option?,"It is good to try different dating apps, since you'll find different kinds of people looking for different things. If one isn't working for you, another one might. I struggle with the apps, but I think they're okay as long as you limit the amount of time you dedicate to them and have some idea of what you want (and what you don't want).



Also, don't rush into anything. I am pretty lonely too and also worry about being able to find a long-term romantic partner, but I'd also like to make sure I find a good fit and someone I feel committed to rather than someone who is convenient."
122,Is there a single country capitalism has worked out?,"You would have to defined what it means for capitalism to ""work out"" first."
123,“Carne Asada”,"Because that's used in English where the words ""carne asada"" don't mean anything to most people - adding the English steak, adds context."
124,Why did Desantis run? It just seems so dumb from every point of view,"Hi /u/Weak_Wind_2164,

126,How do you define being religious?,America.
127,How do I politely ask my girlfriend to shave/clean herself?,Just ask her straight out.
128,How come we used to be able to just join cults or extremist groups?,"Uh, what do you think's happening on 4chan or Gab or any number of other rightwing hives?"
129,"The ""gold and white"" dress looks black and blue to me now, how?","things look different in different colored lights.  so you're brain thinks about the color of the light your in.  and it's subconsciously corrects for that when you look at stuff.   

in this photo, there is not enough visual data for the brain to figure out what color light the dress is in"
130,Would lightning chain on a roof covered in lightning rods?,"No, all those rods do not have the correct _""opposite""_ charges in them. The lightning will seek the earth/ground.

Now, if you had some kind of magnetic/electrically-charged lighting rods with the correct _""alternating/opposite""_ charges then the lightning may bounce around between the rods for a split second but it would definitely overwhelm whatever man-made system is charging all the rods.

The rods would quickly end up all having the same kind of charge and the lightning will just go to the ground. 

All of this would happen in less than a second."
131,Why aren’t American cities big on tourism?,"The tourism industry makes up 3% of America's spending and receives one sixth of all tourists in the world. 

Maybe you're not finding it, but it's there. Yes, it's expensive - but wages in America are higher than China. I've travelled to a number of American cities and always been able to find attractions - water parks, indoor playgrounds, beaches, museums, etc."

133,"Who the hell is buying these ""Raycon"" headphones?",They make lots of stuff.
134,"If Chernobyl never happened, would we still have a energy crisis?","There would still be Three Mile Island and Fukushima to give nuclear a bad name, and nuclear would still be one of the highest startup costs of any kind of energy. Plus, it's unclear if there's enough fissionable materials on Earth to supply all our energy needs for long.

But I agree it would be nice to use it more."
135,Why did Katy Perry go from the most famous person ever to a nobody?,Reddit found out her breasts weren't real.
136,Why is it not Father Nature?,"Mothers are the ones that ""give life""."
137,How should APA citations be ordered?,"That's not APA.

For in-text citations, APA would be :

Frye (Year Frye said it) said X, Andrews (Year Andrews said it) said Y

The reference list is ordered alphabetically, so something like

Andrews, etcetctec

Frye, etcetcetc"
138,"When I had a dream about fighting someone and throwing punches at them, why did my arms actually ache when I woke up ?",There's a very real & likely possibility your real-life arms were moving or at least the muscles were tensing up.
139,"For a written debate with an introduction and Rebuttal, should the appendix go with the introduction or should it go with the Rebuttal?","If they are separate related documents, then put the appendix with the one where these items first come up. 

If they are completely separate documents, and the items are in both, then put it with both of them. 

If they’re together in a single document, then at the end of the entire document."
140,Is there a way to make English not need any pronouns or personal names what so ever?,"Do you remember their names? If you do, could you not just use those?

In my experience, if you don’t know someone’s name or their pronouns, you can literally just use *they*. “They’re over there,” for example."
141,Can I put any kind of sound system in my car??,"Speakers is easy.  Correct size and suitable power rating should work, anywhere selling them where you can listen to them (which you should) should also be able to advise on compatibility - if they can't then go elsewhere.

The rest is more complicated though.  Car stereos used to fit into a standard size slot and be relatively easy to swap out for something else (or add to a car that didn't have one as standard).  These days they tend to be a lot more integrated into the car's other electronics."
142,Can we all come to a collective agreement to not rent a house or a townhouse?,"Most the time: 1-The rich are organized and united 2-Companies  are organized and united  3-The poor/working class are not organized and not united  4-conumers are not organized and not united .. however, when workers/consumers unite, WONDERFUL things happen ...BUT REMEMBER: it's anti-Semitic to unite against rich landlords or banks."

146,Is sleeping for two four-hour intervals the same as sleeping for eight hours?,"Used to be the way everyone did it.
A straight 8 hours of sleep is a fairly new idea.

So it worked for hundreds of years, might work for you.

In case you want to read up.  
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep"
147,How do I start a home excerise routine?,HIT workouts are really good that you could do in your house and burn probably just under twice as many calories as walking. Jump roping is another good option. Both are very intense cardio workouts and will definitely help with increasing your stamina and fitness. Walking is great as well and I would still recommend doing that maybe every night because it's very relaxing and helps keep you in shape.
148,Is the Catholic Church dying?,"i don't know. I'm an excatholic, I abandoned my religion since I was 14. 

Maybe it is. All I can say is that Catholicism has had a lot of scandals over the years. A lot of people distrust it, and maybe that's starting to have an effect on who wants to be associated with it. 

Here in Canada their strongest foothold, at one point, Quebec, outright rejected them and put a number of serious restrictions on what they can do. A lot of people also hate them because of their role in the residential schools and with the First Nations here. 

Like I said, a lot of scandals."
149,Why on earth are desks so expensive,"Inflation, wood is expensive, and people want to make money"
150,What’s up with the popular page lately?,"Can be a combination of bots and/or that's all people are focusing on lately.

One of the many reasons why I have tailored my home page to not include these subs."

152,Is it true that Mexican coke is a lie and actually use corn syrup like America does?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Coke

Coke for domestic consumption may not contain cane sugar, but Coke marked Hecho en Mexico and exported to the U.S. does."
153,PimEyes voice equivilent,This may not be an answer. But I want to point out that the technology is there. We have the ability to ID songs and we have the ability to catalog thousands of sounds. So it may already exist (albeit  probably behind a paywall). Or or it will come soon.
154,Why do your friends suddenly become distant once you announce that you’ve started a business?,Is it MLM?
155,How are indians able to do business in motels & gas stations in America?,"1-They help each other 2-They work/study extremely hard (have no life outside work/school) 3-They save money, they live with VERY LITTLE money, they buy the cheapest things  4- all family is either working and/or studying 5- they take a loan, buy a small motel and THEY LIVE and work in it 6-they buy a bigger one 7- they die, now kids are rich! .. source: I have met tons of them!"
156,"I had been watches the people destroying their pcs and the parents destroying the consoles, Then is it funny or not?","No, consoles and pcs can get expensive"
157,How to tell someone that no one likes them because of their crappy personality?,"'Its because you're an insufferable bitch '

Seriously though, it sounds like your sister may have a personality disorder. Take that with a grain of salt. Internet stranger and all that. You might get more mileage by asking her what she thinks the reason is. Her answer may be very telling as to how she views herself and others."
158,How can I hide my 'hungry eyes' around people I'm attracted to?,Don't stare.
159,"If someone attempts to 'physically intimidate' you, but you are not bothered or scared by their actions towards you, is it still 'physical intimidation?'",Yes it is both intimidation and harassment
160,Is it easier to make friends when lose weight?,"Maybe? Depends on if and how your weight is keeping you from making friends. Some people are very insecure about their weight, which in turn may influence your readiness or comfort with making friends."
161,Serious question: would it be kind of sad (for lack of a better term) to lose my virginity to a prostitute as opposed to a girl genuinely into me?,Yes.
162,Is the silent treatment a form of abuse and why?,"If children are treated this way it's abuse. 

If an adult treats another adult such it's whiny, bitchy behaviour and if they can't articulate their feelings even after days it's a definite red flag."
163,Why are people always staring at me??,You either do indeed look weird or it's a mental health issue (paranoid delusions).
164,How would a man with no limbs eat,Like an animal.
165,5w charger for iPhone 15,"The 5w charger will be quite slow, but yes you can use it, and you should be able to use the 20w also."
166,Are adults struggling financially because we have to many kids?,"Given that even adults with zero kids struggle financially, I'm going to say there's probably other reasons besides that."
167,"Am I weird for finding middle aged, stereotypically geeky looking men very attractive?",Absolutely Not.  that's very normal (says the middle aged geeky looking man)
168,Would waxing all of your hair make you a more efficient human?,"Waxing isn't a one-time thing.   The resources you put into maintenance will outweigh any marginal gains damaged follicles would eventually give you. 

A better way would be to only utilize body temperature liquids for bathing and drinking."
169,Do you go into relationships just completely trusting?,"I don’t know if you mean romantic relationships, but in the case of friendships I personally don’t"
170,"I often see “that would be a good copypasta”, what constitutes good copypasta?","Usually something overly dramatic about something that isn't actually a big deal, and contains key nouns that can be switched out mad lib style and adapted to other situations."
171,Have we figured out how to make gold from alchemy yet?,"No, alchemy wasn't science, and most of it was just plain wrong."
172,"A restaurant has been putting their tables out on the sidewalk, effectivly blocking the walkways of our downtown? Can I just go sit down at the tables without buying anything?","Probably not but we don't know where you are. 

They may have required permits or rights to do this. The right course of action if you are upset is to complain to your city."
173,Why are some people okay with showing their attraction or interest in people?,"You're making the choice to not show your feelings because of some internalized hatred of yourself. Life isn't a conspiracy out to get you. The problem is right there, staring back at you in the mirror."
174,What's the fastest way to learn to code apps?,"You definitely don't need college to make a mobile app. 

There are a bunch of ways to make simple apps.

* https://flutterflow.io/
* https://www.zoho.com/creator/mobile-android-ios-app-maker.html?
* Or any of these https://mashable.com/article/build-mobile-apps

175,Why has woody woodpecker been in Netflix top 10 the past week,"* https://www.whattowatch.com/news/what-is-the-woody-woodpecker-movie-and-how-is-it-in-netflixs-top-10
> _""The best theory that I can come up with on the success of Woody Woodpecker on Netflix is perhaps adults with young children are seeing the movie on the streamer, getting fond memories of their childhood and want to introduce their kids to the character. Maybe the kids are enjoying Woody's antics enough for repeat viewings. Netflix doesn't divulge much specific info on viewership, so we may never know what is spurring this surprising Woody Woodpecker revival. But it'll be interesting to see how long the movie hangs in at the top of the Netflix charts.""_

As a father with 2 kids at home, because of your Reddit question I'm now aware of this movie and I'll probably watch it with my kids in the near future."
176,Do you think that if Hollywood decided to make a movie adaptation of all the original OZ books that they'd do well?,"The Oz books were highly original at the time. Today's landscape is so littered with fantasy that there's no longer any novelty to the genre. And too, the Oz books were heavily laden with turn of the 20th century political and social debate. No one would get the references."
177,Change of fee structure Progress or Greed?,"The ultimate goal of every smart consumer company, to the detriment of consumers, is 'Recurring Revenue'. Money that is made on a regular basis with no additional expenditure of effort or resource on the part of the company. This is modelled after the entertainment industry 'work once, paid forever' business model. 

It is nothing but greed, a way to increase the value of the company on the backs of customers with no additional effort. That said, it's smart business because we have proven that we are stupid enough to pay it. 

Every single 'game pass' user simply reinforces to the industry that we will pay every month for something we could have simply purchased. Unity isn't really making much of a change on that model."
178,What does it feel like to finally come out of depression and how do you know you’ve finally kicked it - what signs are there?,"Joy, even on boring days, I guess."
179,Why do people say billionaires don’t actually have their money?,"Their worth is tied up in assets. They might have a lot of money in various bank accounts, but the majority lies in stocks and property they own. They could liquidate all their stocks to get hard cash, but if they did that they'd have a lot of taxes to pay and probably bring the price of their stocks down as they were doing it. They still *are* billionaires, of course, and have access to as much money as they need (since it can be given with their assets as collateral), but they generally don't have billions in a bank account or underneath their mattress."
180,Opening a Hoarder Clean Up service soon....,"I worked for my local county and nearly every home eschewed to the county for unpaid taxes were almost exclusively hoarder homes.

Hoarder homes are usually derelict wrecks and its rare not to find one in ""the hood"" and they are rarely worth rehabbing.  

Hoarders (that reach the point the city is forcing a clean up) by their nature are usually broke and the properties are usually destroyed by the nature of the hoard.  So theres little money in the business.   And for the properties worth fixing, there is a Enviropro's that specialize in this"
181,Why would people from decades ago check in on me through my sister?,"Yes, this is all perfectly normal. People think about someone or an event in their lives and they become curious as to what the people they knew then are up to. You had a traumatic experience in this vein, so your alarm bells are (understandably) calibrated in an oversensitive way to this type of thing. You might consider asking your sister to just pass along when someone asked about you and then, if you want, you can get in touch with them."
182,Why do I get more attention when I am wearing a ring?,I think that was the premise of an episode of Seinfeld. Pretty funny
183,Anyone who's pee shy ever have to take a piss test?,"I didn't have to have one observed, but I did have to take a pee test to get my current job.  I drank at least half a gallon of water and still had to loiter for like 4 hours before I could finally pee on demand.  It sucked and you're definitely not the only one they have to deal with."
184,Legit question,"It's a group cohesion thing.  ""Yep, we're all old guys around here.  Not as attractive and fit as we once were.""  And being able to react appropriately shows you fit and understand the mores of the group."
185,Do you think the United States will ever have respect for all political sides after Donald Trump is done with politics?,"The division isn't anything new. There were ""Nixon=Hitler"" protest signs, too. It's just become more acceptable to be a total dick about how much you hate the other side, especially considering there is so much more online talk now than there used to be. So it'll keep going like this, too."
186,Why is it that when a web page loads it flickers things and jumps all about?,"It's because it's a lot easier to not care about the size of the ads and article crosslinks.  The page loads what's directly on the page and that's a certain size, then as additional ads, both internal and external, load in it changes the size of the page, causing it to jump around."
187,I (29F) shaved my head and now I feel more fiesty than ever. Can anyone relate?,No
188,How to drink from a straw without liquid touching teeth . /where to place straw . ( videos are appreciated),Deepthroat it
189,Why does vancomycin have to be infused very slowly?,"Vancomycin can cause Red Man Syndrome, which is basically a rash. They infuse it slowly so they can monitor for this rash before you have a lot of it in your system. A severe reaction to a lot of the agent could cause anaphylactic shock and be life-threatening."
190,What your thoughts on vape? And why,"It's gross, just like any other kind of smoking. Worse yet, a lot of people who vape think it ""doesn't count"" and have no problem vaping right in peoples' faces or places where smoking _and vaping_ are not allowed."
191,"With America having such a strong car culture and shitty public transport, how do people with disabilities that prevent them from driving get around?","They find someone to drive them, or they don't get around.  Being homebound is a serious problem for older Americans."
192,How much should you pay for the installation of an AC?,"That's going to be a bit - it will require licensed electrical work and cutting holes in the exterior and interior of the home.  

For US, I'd start with a guess of about $500, more or less depending on the materials involved in the structure, accessibility to the install point,  distance to the electrical panel.   Permits might be extra."
193,Why do I feel so cringe after journaling?,"Because you're being vulnerable.    Don't mistake that for weakness.

Also, what you describe is actually a good thing.  I will journal when feeling bad, then when I reread it later I'm like ""oh, yeah that does seem a bit silly"" and actually helps with anxiety because it forces me to put my feelings into words and you can realize that you don't need to worry as much s your brain is tricking you into thinking you do."
194,Serieus question. How do you give a bj/hj to a guy with fore skin? Do you like.. keep it how it is or pull it behind iykwim?,You gotta ask him. Everyone's different.
195,do they actually arrest the people in the predator hunting videos?,"It depends on the law. Most of the time, they are indeed breaking the law even if there is no actual minor. 

These guys can vary though in how much they work with the police. Most LEOs across the US say such predator hunters should not meet the predators in person, but forward their chat logs to the police and leave it at that. More often than not, although exposing them on their channel does a number on these predators' psyche, their careless attitude and lack of professionalism leads to the individual not being arrested. 

In a number of cases, LEOs have explicitly asked these predator catchers to *stop* because they are *doing more harm than good* and the predators featured in their videos often *get away scott-free*. 

It's not just about whether someone is breaking the law, it's often about whether the state can actually prosecute them based off information gathered by the third party organisations, who often have patreons or a general interest in making more videos on these guys rather than actually getting them arrested.

This is a very touchy subject, but I made a video on a particular organisation a while back, called D.A.P. If you care to, you can watch it [here.](https://youtu.be/VA8pH42B_Q8?si=Y5YqwHcPmt_s1vDA)

Keep in mind that a few months after I posted this video, D.A.P began charging their viewers to watch videos of them physically assaulting the alleged predators and eventually went and got themselves shot in the middle of a grocery store, putting their lives, the innocent bystanders' lives, and the employee's lives in danger."
196,Why is intersex and Trans included in the LGBTIA+ if LGBA are sexualities and intersex and trans more so is about the person?,The community expanded to include more than just sexual orientation.
197,Do you guys think America has the potential to become the best country but it just fucks itself up every day?,"Claiming to and striving to be the ""best"" is exactly what I think the United States suffers from the most."
198,Which video game do you consider the best purely based on story?,Red Dead 2
199,Is it a bad idea to clean a bathtub with a hand drill brush?,You can wear away the enamel.   Get a good soap scum cleaning foam liquid and let that do the heavy work.
200,Magpies scaring away small bird,No birds are going to be nesting in the winter.
201,Why do guys send dick pics?,What good is a dick pic?  That can get you into hot water.
202,What does Screenwriters want from this strike ?,"the big thing is they want AI banned or heavily regulated because it will wipe out their entire industry.

As for the royalties thing, that's often negotiated beforehand.  I have no clue what actually happened with Aaron Paul, but just as a hypothetical - when he was hired for Breaking Bad, the producers said ""OK Aaron, either we'll give you $10,000 an episode, or you can have 0.7% of the royalties if and when the series is syndicated.""  And he picked the sure-thing-money now."
203,"When people behave like asshats in plane flights, don't they get banned from any given airline?",A lot of people manage to make it through life being a raging douche bag for a surprising amount of time before they ever face meaningful consequences so get accustomed to consequence free douchebaggery. These are the stars of these videos you see.
204,I'm really upset... what do you guys think in this situation?,"Grow up bruh.

You lost a project, your colleague got the project. Get over it and learn from it.

You are doing work in a field that really doesn’t give many fucks about technical merits. And business in general doesn’t care for what you desire. Arts and entertainment are entirely subjective. You could be a master of your craft and there will be people that vehemently hate your style. Nothing you can do about it.

Maybe his work sucks, as you say. Or maybe it’s not bad and you just can’t take the sting from losing the project. You’re being overly critical to save face, rather than accept that it just didn’t work out.

Maybe being a people pleaser isn’t as bad, especially when you have a paying client that you need to keep happy. Clients like people who are easy to work with. If they are paying you for to bring their vision to life, they don’t want to deal with some bullshit all the time.

A smart man would take the experience and ask themselves what they can do better next time. Being bitter about it comes from the same emotions that got you passed over for the project in the first place."
205,Can upu eat the entire pepperoncini minus the stem?,Yes. They are delicious.
206,Can someone explain non-duality to me in simple terms?,Is this for your philosophy assignment or something?
207,How do you buy a house?,"Your first step is to find a real estate agent. For this you can look online for reviews or ask around for recommendations. They will guide you through the rest of the process. You'll also need a loan, so reach out to your bank to get the ball rolling there as well."
208,How long does it take for a bruise from a blood draw to go away? Any way to speed that process up?,"No help this time but to stop it happening again, when the needle is withdrawn press as hard as you can with your thumb on the stick point. Count to 60 slowly and keep pressing hard.
This will stop or at least massively reduce the bruising.
Don't bend your arm while doing this either. Just press hard."
209,Hatsune Miku forum post Mandela effect?,"You misremembered something. Happens to all of us, and it's nothing special."
210,why don't people just repeat what they said when asked and instead just say more on top of it?,"The time may have allowed for more thinking on their part so there is more information they wish to add. Might also be they are wanting to explain things further to potentially help you out just in case it might be an understanding issue and not a hearing issue (even if you said ""I didn't hear""...they may take it as a more polite way of ""I didn't understand"" so they explain it anyway). 

Just a guess."
211,How do I see a psychiatrist without health insurance?,Lots of them offer sliding scales to make payment more affordable.
212,Why hasn’t every country put aside their differences and created a global space agency?, Because those differences are meaningful and substantial.

222,Do American students need to remember the names and locations of 50 states?," I did have to learn all 50 states and their capitals in 4th or 5th grade. Can still point out any state and name most capitals. From this thread I gather it is not the norm, but I went to a normal public school in the midwest."
223,Is it weird to raise your child in a religion that you’re not part of?,I think it would be dishonest not to at least let your child know you don't believe in those things
224,"How do I find local classes on things like cooking, dance etc in my area?","What country, what state? If US, look into community College"
225,Is it rude to spend 3+ hours studying in a restaurant/café?,"It's probably not a problem as long as the place isn't super busy, and it helps if you're spending money. You could casually ask one of the nicer waitresses if there's any problem with staying a few hours just to be sure though."
226,Why have they started putting these plastic benches in the men’s room?,Please tell me you tried sitting on it
227,"Why does my cat clean/groom herself in front of me? Sometimes near my face, what is she implying?","She feels safe around you and is cleaning herself, as cats do, for hours a day."
228,I think this girl thinks I am following her to her car. How can I convey that I am not a threat?,"You can just talk to her when you turn in your stuff. ""Hey, I'm in lot B, so I'm not following you if that's where you're headed too.""

I'd honestly be worried that taking a different route to end up at the same place is even more suspicious than taking the direct route."
229,What’s the point of revolution when we’ll always live in a society where a small number own all the country’s wealth?,"That sounds like a loaded question. Not every society has a massive wealth divide. Countries like Norway, Belgium or Iceland have low Gini indexes, meaning that the rich and poor are not nearly as far from each other as countries like South Africa or Brazil. 

A revolution could lower this gap, if that was the goal."
230,What are the odds of getting a prion from eating beef?,"Pretty low, unless you’re eating undercooked brain or something. Beef is widely consumed by many people and prion disease is rare."

232,What maps were used during WW2 in American schools etc.?,"During WW2, Crimea was Russian (though at times occupied by Germany), so the maps would reflect that. The USSR moved Crimea to Ukraine in the 50s"
233,"If I pay the fee, would the car be mine again?","I'll have to contact the towing company and DMV on Monday. 

But even if theoretically I could get the towing company to give me the car, and get the DMV to give me a duplicate title, I would not do it. Because karma is a bitch! 

Luckily, I still have all the paperwork from the sale, so I can show that I sold the car and won't have to pay the towing fees."
234,Why is tattooing a word/name above the eyebrow seen as an entry level face tattoo by those with them?,"It's a current fad that will pass. People will look back at the ""name/word above the eyebrow"" fad like they currently do on fratboy tribals and tramp stamps. Which is why it's never a good idea to participate in ""current fad"" tattoo trends."
235,Can I get a dog for 1 month? How does fostering a dog work?,"You... I mean, if you legitimately want to foster a dog, talk to local foster organisations. They usually need more people to help. If they think you're a good candidate, they will train you and provide food etc.

With that said, the way you phrased this is probably not something that sounds appropriate."
236,Why do store alarm still went on even though all item are already paid?,Whoever was checking you out probably didn't deactivate the security tag properly.

242,Do certain breeds of dogs have retractable claws?,Took about 1 second to find this on the google https://labradoodlehome.com/do-dogs-have-retractable-claws/
243,Anyone know of a good female hair growth supplement? Should I take a natural shot blocker with biotin and zinc ect and or pre-natal vitamin or both?,"You should see a dermatologist. There are multiple causes of hair loss and even though you suspect it's stress, there could be something medical going on like a vitamin deficiency or hormone imbalance. The doctor would determine the cause and give appropriate treatment specific to your loss."
244,Have anyone noticed how some subreddits seems to shadow hide posts and messages w/o ever noticing the poster?,Silent censorship. Funnily enough something most of Reddit seems to be against.
245,How do I stretch my tongue to make it longer?,"*clears throat*

On behalf of everyone here: Why do you want to make your tongue longer?"
246,Why does my face look incredibly asymmetrical when I use my front facing camera?,"Photographs show your face as others see it, not flipped as you're used to seeing it in the mirror.  Some front facing cameras do reverse,  writing on t-shirts being reversed in some selfies is a giveaway sign of this.  Yours sounds like its showing it as others would see it.

The asymmetry is the same (and normal, most faces are not perfectly symmetrical).  You're just used to the asymmetry being a certain way around and seeing it the other way around makes it obvious.

Edit: A camera you're holding yourself is also likely to be closer than you'd stand to a mirror.  The perspective of a close view can also be unflattering (portrait photographers tend to use a longer lens and stand further away for this reason).  That might also be contributing to you noticing things more."
247,How do I stop sleepwalking and eating?,A locked or blocked door will probably do the trick
248,Would it be weird for me (M28) to see an Olivia Rodrigo concert by myself?,No. I went to the Taylor Swift concert recently and the people next to me were solo too. Normal. Enjoy yourself!
249,Reptilians? Trying to learn.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_conspiracy_theory might help, or it may just mean us old people are wrinkly"

251,how to date someone/be seen as a romantic option with women,Seems like you need to start flirting and/or open up about deeper subjects.
252,How did people develop different accents in other countries?,Same way you developed your accent.
253,How do I make effective notes?,"Predict/ anticipate what sort of questions will come up regarding the materials. Ask: How will they test me on this stuff?

Essays/ long answers: reduce materials to # of reasons/ factors for X.

Rote memorization: flashcards. The Anki program/ app is great for this. Creating the cards themselves is a form of studying."
254,"Every couple years they find Levi denim in abandoned mines, and they sell for crazy amounts of money. Are they pulling these off 140yr old bodies? Or did guys just decide to Donald Duck it one day after digging?","Jeans used to be overwear, in fact they used to be marketed as “waist-high over-alls.” You wore them over your nicer pants. It’s not that odd to leave clothing meant solely for protection or covering your clothes, like an apron or a smock, at work."

256,How do animals know to look us in the eye?,"I think every tetrapod probably understands how to recognize the eyes of another tetrapod: it's a matter of life and death to know if a predator is looking at you or not.

I think predators like dogs and cats might have a more complicated system of communication because their forward-facing eyes make turning to focus on you a much clearer message.

Being aware that another creature can see as you see and remember as you remember (as opposed to simply using eyes to communicate/instinctively percieving eye contact as a threat or botched hunt) is a higher level of intellect, part of ""theory of mind"". I think scientists were surprised to find that crows have this, for example: they will hide food in front of one crow and run back to the hiding spot if they see that specific crow return, because ""he saw, he knows""."

258,"Is this text really ""cringe""?",You need smarter friends. You did absolutely nothing wrong.

261,How often are you suppose to get a Pap smear?,Annually.
262,"Why is it common for Redditors to say ""I don't mean to x but..""",It’s a very common practice in real life as well. It’s used to try and save face or preemptively defend themselves when they want to do or say something they know will be perceived negatively. If they truly didn’t expect someone to take offense at what they’re saying they wouldn’t have said “ I don’t mean to ___” in the first place
263,Is it possible to get ripped without the diet dedication?,"Depends on what you mean by putting on some muscle. If you just want to be “in decent shape”, you have to pay some attention to your diet, but not necessarily your full focus. If you want to be absolutely ripped, yes you have to optimise your diet, well you have optimise almost every aspect of your life around that goal. 

If by protein complementary food, you mean protein bars and shakes, the bars get really expensive, and the shakes you can make by yourself could be relatively cheap, but ultimately it’s best to get your protein from less processed sources like chicken breast, if you can. 

If you are skinny, you do have to eat enough to bulk up. But if you are just looking to be reasonably toned with a bit of muscle, it shouldn’t be necessary to strictly count your calories and count your every macronutrient, and you don’t need to go to the extremes of eating 3000 calories with 150g of protein or anything huge like that. 

If you are a beginner to weightlifting, you can build some level of muscle relatively easy and quickly before you hit a plateau. Follow a simple lifting routine like the stronglifts 5x5 plan, do it 3x a week, eat a bit more than your usual and try to focus on protein sources. You can use a scale to monitor if you are slowly gaining weight. If you want to progress beyond that and get even more muscular, then you can consider from then on. But the best thing to do is to get started and get yourself used to a routine, after that you can decide whether to become even more dedicated and make it even more complex. 

People in prison still get muscular, even for those who can’t count calories and macros and can’t eat whatever they want. Manual laborers in developing nations are lean-muscular. One of my friends works out and is quite muscular, and what he eats is just whatever is food leftover at the bar at the end of shift (he works as a bartender). Sure, I think he has lucky genetics and genetics help, but you can make it work."
264,Is it normal to use your mom's facebook account to check out her friends,No…
265,I want to turn off this thing that shows fps and gpu usage but idk what program is doing this. What's it called?,Looks like its the overlay from Riva Tuner Statistics Server which may be installed by itself or packaged along with MSI Afterburner.
266,Are judges just being petty?,"Ever heard of [Ariel Castro?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Castro_kidnappings) He was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison. That's ridiculous, right? Nobody could possibly live that long! But it turns out that even a sentence like that is actually pretty reasonable.

Those super long sentences are actually the result of *multiple* crimes being added together. Castro's thousand-year sentence is actually the result of **937** counts of kidnapping, rape and aggravated murder. When you add up the punishment for all those crimes, you may instead wonder why he wasn't given a *longer* sentence!

There's a good reason why courts do it this way - three, actually. First, it's part of giving justice to victims. The victim of the crime and their families deserve to know that the offender is getting punished for what they did to *them*, whether or not they are already getting punished for a different crime they committed. Secondly, it prevents the criminal from getting released if they are able to overturn *one* of their sentences on appeal. And thirdly, it can help keep that person in prison! In many countries, a life sentence isn't actually for life - it could mean a set number of years (25 or 15), or it could come with the possibility of parole after some time has passed. In other countries, someone must serve a percentage of their full sentence before they are eligible for parole (one third of their sentence in Canada, for example) or before they are moved from prison to house arrest (two-thirds of their sentence in Minnesota, for example). If someone has a sentence of 200 years, then even one-third of that is going to be long enough that it won't matter much to survivors."

276,Is a want to experience prostrate orgasms make me gay?,"No, you should choose your preferred position, and if you like having an orgasm while lying stretched out with your face towards the floor that's completely fine."
277,Why is it wrong for someone with a girlfriend/boyfriend to go out to drink with friends?,"The actual red flag is people who don’t want their partners going out with friends. You either trust them to not cheat on you, or you should just break up. This was more common in high school with guys who were insecure and/or jealous and manipulative. But it’s even more of a red flag to not have grown out of this thought process by adulthood."
278,"Is it The Jones', The Joneses, or The Jones's","If their name is Jones, then Jones' is the singular possessive. That would be saying ""this is the place owned by a Jones"". The plural possessive would be Joneses'. If they wanted to say ""There are a lot of people named Jones here"", then that would be the plural, which would be Joneses. 

Given that they started with ""The"", I suspect they wanted the possessive, and probably the plural, so it should probably be Joneses'."
279,Why is there no full screen smartphone/Iphone?,"You want some bezel.  A totally edgeless screen would be even more vulnerable to damage than phones already are. It also gives you somewhere to hold the phone without activating the touch screen.

In terms of cameras behind the screen, these [already exist](https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/under-display-camera-phones/)."
280,Is QAnon still a thing?,"One of its more notable promoters, Jim Caviezel, stars on the film Sound of Freedom, which is alleged to have QAnon ties. But it has quieted down significantly as many followers have grown disillusioned after many failed predictions, and other promoters have either backtracked or kept silent on their support due to legal troubles."
281,Can my school access my history through my email?,No. Email accounts don’t have access to search history.
282,question abt STD's and pregnancy,IVF.
283,What are your thoughts on the Marc Jacobs tote bag?,"It's over priced designer tat that isn't good for anything except impressing people who aren't worth impressing.

On top of that, I think it's pretty tacky looking."
284,Am I the idiot for feeling frustration/anger for my partner traveling to another country for a few days?,"You're not an idiot, but something you'll understand more with time and experience is that it's good and healthy for partners in a relationship to take time for themselves. You are still individual people and you don't need to (and shouldn't) do every single thing together. It doesn't sound like you're worried about her cheating or anything like that while she's away -- just that you're feeling left out. It's also not like she's going for months; she'll only be gone for a few days. Your partner is communicating clearly with you and it's up to you to decide if what she's offering is something you can live with. 

If you want to be included on one of these trips in the future, you could suggest that. You don't have to come on every single one, but maybe it would be nice to do once or twice. But for now, it's important to recognize that your partner hasn't done anything wrong and is allowed to have aspects of her life that don't involve you."
285,Where does the light in the sun comes from?,When two atoms are fused together it's so energetic that a photon is created.
286,How did the idea get started that a tip you give is based on the total price of the bill?,As opposed to what? Keeping track of how many times they've had to walk back and forth to every single table the entire evening?
287,"Whenever I hear Republicans in smaller counties say they want to secede away from big cities, the democrats always counter that if they did, they would have no money bc the cities have all/most of the money. Is this true and how?","Big cities have large populations which means more employees, more businesses, more people buying things, more events and entertainment. There are more things to do in general and more opportunities, so people with money are often more attracted to those areas."
288,How is Steven Seagal’s movie career a thing?,His movies were entertaining enough that people would go see them. Note that entertaining doesn't mean they're good movies.
289,I have personal-training homework and the person I'm training isn't following my schedule. How can I get them to follow it?,Are you not able to talk about your difficulties in getting them to follow it? Seems like that would be a common problem in personal training and worth discussing on its own in the paper?
290,Android boxes,Android TV box?  Be careful - those things are apparently frequently infested with malware.
291,Anyone else ever forget whether a memory actually happened or if it was just a dream?,"Yes, all the time"
292,Is it normal to keep waking up horny?,My sex drive has peaks and troughs to be honest. I’ll go for months or not thinking about it then have a few weeks of just having to choke the gecko 3/4 times a day until dust is coming out
293,Currently getting inquiries for table service at a high-end nightclub. They always want to know what the occasion is? Will it make a difference what my answer will be?,"Yes, weddings will cost more."
294,Question about Affirm loan payment option.,"Affirm may offer a lower interest rate than a credit card, assuming you make all payments on time.

Depending on card, carrying any balance in a credit card month to month will subject any carried balance, and possibly new charges as well, to interest charges at an APR of 20% or more.

Even for my main credit card, it's ""plan it"" BNPL feature still charges over 1% fees per month."

296,How do I (17M) tell my therapist that one of my only stress relief methods is bad?,"Therapists are there to handle your thoughts my guy, honesty is key if you want to improve. They won’t judge, most have heard much worse."
297,Is the fact that we can see things in space millions of lightyears away proof that things have been around for millions of years?,That's the gist of it. Yeah.

299,What was the word for someone who subscribes to an idea or a belief that automatically makes anyone who doesn’t share it the bad guy and any form of criticism is shut down as them being “corrupted”?,"I don't know that there is a specific word for an individual. Maybe dogmatic or closeminded. More generally especially in politics you will sometimes hear the concept of a ""purity test"" which is getting at the idea that one needs to have a certain level of adherance to an idea to really be considered a true member."
300,Do women glance at crotches?,No. No one could care any less about your penis.
301,What to do when called the N word,"Yo. Don't listen to most of these people. You can tell a lot of them aren't black.

Just be calm, don't show that you're upset.


You have to record them saying it.


 Bring it to a teacher and your parents. Usually being called the n word is a big deal even with administration. And if administration doesn't react to you being called the n word, you escalate it much higher. In most cases administration would protect their reputation than a racist student.

Also if you want to be petty, just casually refer to them as racist. Whenever you see them. 

People hate being referred to as racist (even if they are) because it strongly implies a character deficit."

303,"Are all porn sites, porn content and porn makers the same?",There‘s market leaders and niche sites like in any online industry.
304,"The bank accidentally deposits £10m into your account for 5 hours, is there anyway to financially gain before they take it back?","You can spend it all on scratch tickets and turn £10m into £1m. 

I used to work at a gas station and people would sell their house to buy scratch tickets. But, the more you play, the closer you get to the odds."
305,Do you have a screen protector on your iPhone or do you let it stay uncovered trusting the durability and scratch resistance of the screen?,"I think it helps somewhat, if only for peace of mind"
306,Why do some songs not list every artist that’s featured in the song title?,"It just depends on what deal they made with the label or artists involved, often it doesn’t show in the title but does show in the metadata"
307,"Need advise on what we could do about a landlord who has breached our contract, and lied?","for the noise, you can check your local city/town and see if they have a noise ordinance. some places have an ordinance in place where you need to be quiet and respectful during certain hours of the night/morning. 

as far as the dust particles, again depending on where you live, if you are in the USA, that goes against the U.S. Fair Housing Act, which was put in to provide protections for those with disabilities. Asthma is classified as a disability under the FHA & ADA. 

this [article](https://nchh.org/2017/04/ensuring-an-asthma-safe-home/) goes over some options tenants have to get this resolved. 

good luck!"
308,Why is it still twitter?,Because rebranding a company and its flagship (only?) product is a massive undertaking that requires incomparably more planning than a new CEO jumping in and renaming it.
309,Are people more selfish today than they were 20 years ago?,"For large groups of people, the average amount of selfishness is mostly determined by trust in others. In a low-trust environment, the opposite of selfishness is gullibility.

People now are more selfish/less gullible than twenty years ago when it comes to their professional life. They are more willing to screw over their employers/employees/business partners and exploit the system to get money. This is because authorities have regularly exploited people's trust in them.

People now are less selfish/more kind than twenty years ago when it comes to their personal life. They are more willing to go out of their way to make others feel comfortable and to understand their point of view. This is because of cultural progress and effort to bring mutual understanding across groups."
310,Can billionaires actually solve world problems?,"It's a bit more complicated than that. If they could somehow use their money to those ends with a guarantee that it goes to to right cause, then yes. That's a big if though."
311,Keeping Green Onions Perpetually?,"This is called ""gardening,"" and it's easier to do in dirt.

What you're describing is hydroponic gardening.  Green onions / scallions are plants which are hydroponic-compatible.

It's a bit more involved than just dissolving fertilizer in the water, but yes, it is viable to do something similar to what you're wanting to do.  

​Google hydroponic scallions for many, many pages with information on how to successfully grow them hydroponically."
312,What is the most wasteful dish of an expensive ingredient?,"Does lobster have that much flavor though? The few times I’ve had it, it just seemed like a vehicle for the butter and seasoning.  I had it in Maine too."

314,Feeling late for masters degree,"Plenty of people go to school when they're much older than that. You're never too old to learn. I know several people who were in their 50s when they decided to make career changes.

Absolutely nobody will give a shit about your age. Do your thing."
315,"I'm trying to get off Facebook, and it's not as easy as it seems ... does anyone else share my problem? What did you do? Reddit isn't a great alternative...",I wish FB would separate the marketplace from the app. Then it would be a lot easier to ditch

317,What are those little rings below bottle caps for?,"They keep the bottle cap attached prior to purchase.  If the ring is longer attached to the cap at time of purchase, you know it has been opened/tampered with."
318,"Can you construct a sentence which confuses the words ""equate"" and ""equivocate"" but still makes sense ?","I don't think you can in an actually gramatical sentenc because equate is a transitive verb (requires an object) and equivocate is an intransitive verb (doesn't require an object).

This means the stuctuee of the sentences will be different. You can equivocate. Or you can ""equivocate on/between A and B""

Equate on the other hand requires an object. So you equate A and B.

Fundamentally yhe sentence structure is different for the two words because of that.

Now, that doesn't mean you couldn't squeeze out an informal, non gramatical but still comprehensible sentence."
319,Is it just me or is every 3rd person autistic these days?,"Autism is more understood, and diagnosis/support more available nowadays, which is why more people are able to learn that they're autistic."
320,How do I remove a spark plug that’s really stuck.,Drown it in some wd-40. Also what are you using that your tool bent?
321,"On graph paper with binder holes, why do they print the red margin line on the wrong side?","The margin line is for the left side, not the hole side. We write left to write."
322,I have an 6 year old gaming laptop. should I buy a gaming PC or a next-gen console?,"If you want simplicity and console exclusives, then buy the console.

If you want access to thousands of games (including the free ones given away by Epic every Thursday), and the ability to mod some games to your liking (eg. Skyrim/Starfield/XCOM2 etc), then get a gaming PC."

330,Is anyone other than scammers using Reddit chat?,"Yes, I use it to talk to people"
331,Can ulnar nerve syndrome cause arm swelling?,"From what I am reading, it could be the opposite. Arm swelling can narrow the nerve channels, and cause ulnar nerve compression. You may have cause and effect backwards.

In any case a doctor, not Reddit, is the answer."
332,Who are potentially going to be the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees?,"The incumbent running for another term, will usually be the nominee for their party, barring some unexpected event like something happens to him or he decides not to run again.   In which case, it might end up being Harris that runs.  

For the republican side where there’s a lot of people running, right now there’s a few front runners including trump, but there’s a lot that can happen between now and the republican national convention next year when they officially nominate their candidate."
333,Am I Better Off Staying Off Tic Tok?,"Neither have i, honestly think i have a lot more free time as a result"
334,Do religious people actually believe in the god stuff?,"Certainly 😊 However I have known people with a ""fake it to you make it"" attitude, with uncertain faith, and they eventually come into full faith from their attempts, but not everyone."
335,If you have rabies can't they just inject fluids since you can't drink water?,"IV hydration is an option, yes. But that wouldn't ultimately help - rabies patients die from inflammation of their brain, not from dehydration."
336,Why are India and China so populated compared to other countries if their size?,Usually it means there was a time having alot of children was the key to survival. In Chinas case it was that demon Mao's policies
337,"Has the world always been this way, or is it just bad now?","Through most of human history it was much, much worse."
338,Meaning of Financial Entity,"Bank. Credit union, etc"
339,Is there a way to tell on the Internet Archive whether or not an unavailable book will eventually become available?

341,What is a P-Co?,"Knowing Stephen King, it could be a local to the book’s slang Pepsi Cola."
342,Why are companies not more for social/welfare programmes?,"It all comes down to money. While many of the things you listed would be beneficial for the company itself in the long-run, profits rule the roost, unfortunately."
343,What’s so entertaining about sports to men?,"Getting upset to a point of breaking things is an anger problem not a sports problem 

To you actual question: it’s a getaway.  For the three hours I’m watching a football game, I’m in that world. I’m not thinking about work, or bills, or anything else.  I’m just enjoying the moment.  And so are the people around me.  Doesn’t matter our politics, our religions, our social status. For that time, we are all fans of that team, trying to boost them to victory."
344,Help me find a video,"I have no idea, but i think you will have more luck on /r/tipofmytongue"
345,How am I supposed to put effort into looking good when it already takes all my effort to simply shower and shave?,I don’t know the answer but I’m in the same boat. Hopefully someone has some good advice.
346,How do I make sure I enjoy this concert?,Depends on the consert really. What kind of music is it? Who is performing? And in which place?
347,"what is an idiom/proverb that's the opposite of ""the gift that keeps on giving""?",Just use that same one but sarcastically.
348,Do people who want the British monarchy dissolved want each country to be its own independent entity? Or be under a more secular kind of rule?,"Those are 2 separate issues. Dissolving the monarchy would have no direct impact on how the UK is run, as the monarch does not in practice exert any power. Independence for the countries that are currently part of the UK would mean that they would make all decisions in their own parliaments, elected only by their own people, instead of being bound by decisions made by the UK parliament which is elected by all the people of the UK."
349,Women’s clothing sizing,"Sizing varies wildly based on manufacturer.  Honestly your best bet, if you're unwilling / unable to go to stores to try things on, is to find websites with a good return policy and just order a few different sizes of the same item and only keep the one that fits well."
350,Why drugs in the USA seems so much stronger than in Europe ?,"No one posts videos of something boring.

I'm an American, and I went right back to my job after getting my wisdom teeth out. Handled a few emails and conference calls, then asked if I could check out a little early that day.

Nothing worthy of a video."
351,Do any men actually find these ridiculously long salon done fingernails attractive?,"Personally, I find them absolutely hideous. But they aren't for me. They do it because they like it themselves."
352,How do I stop “falling in love” with every stranger that shows me a tiny bit of kindness?,"Generally, people who do this have very poor self image, so they seek validation in others. If you can't learn to accept and validate yourself, you're going to keep seeking this in other people."
353,Whats something you give good advice on but you personally struggle with achieving?,"Helping people get over their worries.

Cannot do it to myself."
354,how do straight girls react when being asked out by lesbians ?,"I’m so flattered!!  I’m sorry, I’m not gay, but thank you."
355,"why fight the other, rather than your own cheating partners?",If it's the affair partner's fault they don't have to feel like they failed in keeping their partner happy. And they can live in denial that it was a special circumstance with that particular AP and won't happen again.
356,"Does anybody else feel that younger people now are more violent and/or abusive during sex, and why?","There's been plenty of kink sex everywhere in the lgbt community and in general the past century. The Internet and fewer social taboos just makes its much more accessible and visible now (which does increase its participants). 

But from my expeirance the vast majority of gay people aren't engaging in bdsm sex at all and if they do its very much bot the default. It's more likely confirmation bias as why would there be posts/conversation about ""normal"" more vanilla sex. its the norm."
357,Am I Overreacting??!!,That's weird and unprofessional
358,"Help, I jacked off on camera on the Internet and got scammed.","It’s not that hard to “fake send” these things and make it appear to you that he’s doing it.

From the scammer’s perspective: he doesn’t _want_ to send the videos of you because then he loses his leverage— once the video is sent he can’t ask you for more money.

So he will try to fake it to get you to pay a second time.

They will probably come back in a month or so to try again.

Same answer- block and ignore.

It was a mistake to send him money… but block and ignore is the best way to go and never ever ever do anything like this again. Ever.

If you want to do the naked chat thing- do it with someone you know and trust."
359,are women on average more attractive than men?,Most people are pretty fucking ugly (source stuck in an airport all day recently)
360,How to use up the last amount of money on a gift card?,it just gets used up and you gotta pay the remainder
361,How do I stop media multitasking?,It’s playing on your dopamine receptors just like a slot machine. It’s your own reality you’re trying to escape. Why is it hard to stop playing video games and put the time instead towards learning a life fulfilling experience or skill? It’s about priorities and what you want.
362,Is their insurance that doesnt cover your car?,There is liability only insurance that doesn't cover your car but does cover any damage you do with it.
363,Why are there not fuses on jumper cables?,Because the kind of person who doesnt know how to use jumper cable yet tries to do it themselves instead of paying for AAA isnt going to buy the fancy jumper cables with fuses.
364,"How high is ""too high"" for a body count?","Seems like you should rephrase this question as, “should I stop telling my roommate literally everything so he can stop judging me & my dating life” you didn’t have a problem w it till your friend had a problem w it. Grow up, be more secure. 5 years till you’re 30. Don’t bring that energy w you."
365,Why do Americans order food delivery so much? Do you guys just not eat at the restaurants?,You have to drive everywhere in America. Food delivery is just paying someone else to drive for you.

377,Why do my clothes not bleed colour in the wash?,youre color blind and have been wearing pink clothes for years
378,How is the universe 93 billion lightyears in diameter?,"The expansion of spacetime is *accelerating*. It is accelerating in some places faster than the speed of light (the speed of light applies to *information* being transmitted through spacetime, not spacetime itself)."
379,How are you supposed to know about copyright law in advance?,Ignorance of the law is not an excuse to break it. You are expected to do your due diligence before engaging in activities.
380,"If you had your mouth sewn shut, could you eat via your nose?",You could put in a feeding tube yes
381,Why does my head vibrate when near the microwave?,Id get a new microwave...
382,How to get to know people in new country?,Is there an equivalent to some kind of meetup or get-together site where there is a list of activities in the area where you can pick something that interests you? That way both you and the people going there have the same interests in at least that event.
383,Is it normal for a girl to fall asleep every single time after masturbating?,Sounds normal to me. As long as it doesnt cause you significant issues I wouldnt worry about it.
384,Do you really have to drink 64oz of water a day if you’re not doing anything?,"Not necessary.   The hydration craze is overestimated,  even some doctors think so.   Your brain will tell you when you need fluids ( it's been doing so for centuries!).  Some consciousness of fluid intake of course is good.  * Met a ,95 year old who never drank fluids while eating in order to allow stomach acid to do their work undiluted,!"

386,How do mermaids have babies?,"Mermaids don't exsist, probably that's why they don't have be pregnant, it's fiction and the storyteller can make up as many mermaids as they would like to have in the story.  
And so they always be fine and beautiful."
387,Dumb question please help....,27 as well. I “know” mine but I don’t have it memorized or anything. I have to look it up any time I need it
388,Shoulder stretch marks,"Sometimes stretch marks are simply a genetic issue, but if you get them from working out it’s probably because you’re not moisturizing your skin properly. Working out releases cortisol (adrenaline hormone) and the release of cortisol lessens your skins natural elasticity. I would recommend moisturizing whatever area of the body your focusing on before you go to the gym- with an actual thick lotion or a body oil, not a moisturizing body wash or hand cream, etc. and of course, stay as hydrated as possible."
389,Any really really famous people on here?,My neighbors don't even know my name.
390,Should I hire a private investigator?,Maybe it could have something to do with the fact you don’t talk to them anymore? Not really sure how to help here tbh. Lol
391,How many normal house cats do you think it would take to kill one fully grown male brown bear?,I think the bear would die of exhaustion before any number of cats managed to do anything to it. I don't think their claws or fangs could even get through a bear's fur and skin.

395,Dirty talk,Unique to the individual
396,"This woman I started seeing, is amazing, funny, smart, sexy, she teaches ES. We are hooked on each other yada yada. But, I just found out yesterday she is a Trump fangirl. Lmao. I myself am a Centrist Democrat.",I wouldn't be with someone that votes against human rights
397,Why do so many people fetishize the soviet union and think they are the heroes of ww2?,Because the USSR took on 2/3 of the German military and inflicted 80% of their casualties.  That's just fact.
398,Are big eyes considered attractive?,"Yes, big eyes are considered one of the universal parameters of attraction"
399,Should computers have tutorials?,"Microsoft puts familiar games on its computers as stealth tutorials. Solitaire teaches click and drag, etc. 

Personally, I get annoyed when there are extra screens or buttons in the way of what I'm trying to do and don't need or want a tutorial. I'm a developer and know the feature of windows/macos/Linux really well. WSL, powershell, terminal, env variables, etc. You can watch videos on YouTube if you want to learn more"
400,"If we all cut down our consumption to half, would we all be able to work only half our time?","Considering that in the western world we throw away the majority of the food we produce, no"
401,what do you think average person's understanding of emotional maturity/intelligence is?,Probably pretty average.
402,"Why does water extinguish fire? There’s oxygen in water, and you can weld underwater. Some things even burn underwater.","There is very little oxygen carried by water. If you’re referring to the O part of H2O then that’s not available as it’s bound to hydrogen, in the same way that the hydrogen doesn’t ignite on contact with heat, as it’s bound to the oxygen."
403,Life isn't good. What do I do?,Stoicism or absurdism
404,Can people who are incapable of creating mental images still develop schizophrenia?,"My oldest sister was diagnosed with both aphantasia, and schizophrenia. So, yes."
405,I’ve never had a headache. What does it feel like and has anyone else lacked this experience?,Imagine an ice pick and someone nailing it through your eye and then twisting it.
406,What's the most common second language taught in Australian schools?,"i’ll guess since it’s the nearest country, Bahasa Indonesia"
407,"Do construction workers get the same credit as engineers for bridges, dams, buildings, etc. not collapsing? Since they were the ones that built them?","They built them to specifications, so although they are skilled workers doing a difficult thing, the only reason the specific structure they built is stable is because it was properly designed."
408,Anyone else stare in the mirror every chance they get?,My now husband did while we were dating and I almost didn't marry him becauae of it.  His mother had mirrors in every rom in their house After marriage the only mirrors were in the bathroom and bedroom.  He also started gaining weight which put a end to his vanity.
409,Is it creepy to use images of somebody else and then say that it's you?,"Hi /u/One-Stock-9942,

410,if you get flashbanged is it like in videogames?,"Nothing like in games.

The explosion of magnesium-based pyrotechnic chemicals causes a very bright flash and a loud sound (160−180 decibels), which can cause temporary blindness, temporary loss of hearing and loss of balance, as well as a sense of panic. Parts of the device can burst and travel as shrapnel so you can get physically injured from the ojbect."
411,Do women find kindness in men attractive as a personality trait?,More like a bare minimum for most of us than something I'd call attractive.
412,How do you brush your teeth?,"My dentist tells me not to rinse with water after spitting, but I still do because it feels gross to leave toothpaste in there."
413,Dose all software gradually grow larger with updates?,Usually updates work by just tacking new stuff onto whats already there. So etkmes they might replace or remove things though. Depends on if they have a reason to do so.
414,Am I going to get cold sore because my sister sneaked some of my drink?,"Maybe, maybe not."
415,Is it weird that I can’t bring myself to throw away things from my childhood?,"This is the start to hoarding. I’ve seen the show. 
Good luck, dear OP. One day you may find yourself trapped in what the very stuff you love so much."
416,Do women really get angry at their partners over cheating in their dream?,"I've certainly had bad dreams where my husband said or did something to upset me (not usually involving cheating, mind you), and I've woken up feeling bad as a result. But even when I've just woken up and my brain hasn't come online yet, I know that I'm angry at my dream version of my husband, rather than the reality. And the things he does in my dreams are always wildly out of character for him. I'm able to separate dream from reality, and if I think there might be some holdover resentment I warn him in advance of my bad mood. 

Last week I had a dream where *I* did something to upset HIM, and woke up feeling worried that he would still be angry with me. 

Overall, though, no, I don't really get angry with him for what he does in my dreams."
417,Why do women find the sims games so interesting.,"Usually for the same reasons men do: Building a make believe perfect life, making wacky characters and scenerios, and torturing the sims we dont like."

There’s nothing wrong with falling asleep past midnight"

Some of my favorites:

Space oddity

ashes to ashes

Heroes 

Golden Years

China Girl

Modern Love

Blue Jean"
424,how is a month calculated?,1st of the month to the 1st of the next month.
425,If you aren’t American and decided to visit the US what was/would be the first place(s) you’d go if you had two weeks? (I ask this as an American who loves to travel abroad so curious to hear what your answer would be),IDK about first but Yellowstone is a must IMO.
426,How long does it take for a freezer to make ice inside after being unplugged for like 2 days?,"Do you mean ice cubes from an ice maker?  For that, a water line needs to be connected to the fridge.  Is the water line correctly connected and turned on?  Are the settings for the icemaker turned on?  Have you checked the owner's manual for troubleshooting tips or information for how long it should take to make a tray of ice?  Have you searched google for these kinds of things to troubleshoot the problem?  Most ice machines should be making ice within the first 24 hours.  

Do you mean frost that develops on the sidewalls?  That shouldn't happen in newer freezers.  That also should take at least a month or two before it would need defrosted if it does build up ice.

A freezer that is unplugged will never make any kind of ice."
427,Temp to store canned tuna,"The storage temperature is a quality issue, and not a safety issue. If you're buying it and using it in a reasonable timeframe, you'll never notice anything. If you're stocking your TEOTWAWKI\* bunker, maybe rotate them out earlier than the best by date on the can.

\*TEOTWAWKI: **T**he **e**nd **o**f **t**he **w**orld **a**s **w**e **k**now **i**t."
428,Can I safely look at the full Sun using eclipse glasses?,"You’re generally not supposed to, but limited exposure should be fine. 

The glasses are really designed to look at the limited light from an eclipse, but not the brightness from the full sun. If they were darker so you could look at the sun, an eclipse would be harder to see."
429,"Hardcore Christians only, no progressives. Is pegging still sodomy?","hardcore christians!! lol made me laugh

devout christians  yeah will call it sodomy"
430,Is the writers strike really about AI?,"Studios are trying to get writers and actors to sign over their style and likeness. It's not that they'll be fully replaced by robots in the next couple of years, it's that the studio is trying to claim ownership of ""writing in the style of [writer X]"" so that it can hire a two-bit intern to feed prompts into the finetuned language model and clean up the output for a fraction of the cost that it takes to hire the writer themself. With actors, studios are trying to get high resolution scans of actors' faces that the studio is the legal owner of, so that the studio can use those scans in (AI-supported) CGI forever after. 

Right now, the studio's best attempts at this might need more time and money to make serviceable than hiring the actors and writers, but the studios are preparing for technology to improve further in the future by demanding now that writers and actors sign over as many of their defining features as lawyers think might stick."
431,Is it illegal to own ivory,As long as your not trying to sell it your fine.
432,"Every year hundreds of thousands of people disappear without a trace and life goes on. But what happens if instead of common people, all the 2700 billionaires suddenly disappear?",They get replaced with new billionaires as people inherit the money.  The billionaires are just the symptom of a much broader problem.
433,Do you reckon Apple Music will ever be as popular as Spotify?,Only if Apple buys it.
434,Is there actually a sound quality difference between Spotify and Apple Music?,"Apple has lossless.
Unsure if Spotify does but I’ve never used that hot garbage streaming service."
435,Do all plants produce oxygen? Do they all make the air safe to breathe?,"To the first question, yes. Even plants that eat insects photosynthesize. This process releases oxygen. 

This doesn't exactly make air safe. Sarin gas doesn't affect plants. They will keep taking in CO2 and release oxygen. But if the room is full of sarin, you will die(or wish you were dead) and the plants keep chugging along."
436,Is there anything we eat that doesn’t come from something living? (Not including liquids),Salt
437,What’s that tasty looking thin red sauce I see people dip their tortillas in?,Usually its the leftover juices from stewed meat.
438,Why is no one talking about Japan releasing nuclear water into the ocean?,"Because it's actually not a big deal. It's tritium, which is a hydrogen isotope that the ocean already has a bunch of naturally, and it will decay on its own in a decade or two."
439,Just realized I have no idea where my drivers license is and there's about 4 different bars and a concert venue that it could be at. How much is my identity at risk now?,Not any more than it was before.
440,Why do spouses have a rebound\person of physical attraction when they break things off with you? Would that be cheating since it’s during the relationship before breaking it off?,"Every healthy human should have a life that spreads beyond just their spouse/immediate family.     They should have friends, co workers, acquaintances already in their lives.   
If they have a balanced life, then many will even have others who are interested in them.   Because the married spouse is married, those other folks may not say anything.  They may hint about it, or they may come out and offer temptation.    The married spouse might ignore hints, and might shut down offers of temptation... while they are in their marriage.  

As soon as that relationship breaks down, there's less reasons for the former spouse to turn those advances down or ignore them.   They might also reach out themselves - they are capable of asking others out, too.   

They probably won't date assholes/manipulative bitches unless it's just for sex or to piss off the ex.    But they will have needs, and they probably will have the tools to fill those needs."
441,What would you say is the #1 reason for most relationships not working out?,Shallow attraction. Just because two people think each other are hot doesnt mean they can get along.
442,"Men with sisters, do you assume your sister's boyfriend/husband is a bad guy at first?","No, why would I do that?"
443,how do i enter a romantic relationship in college,Join the LGBT club
444,Anyone know how to set up record players?,"I'm old so I know the ways of vinyl...

But its hard not knowing what your setup is.

You have a receiver, turntable, and speakers?

You plug the RCA's in the phono jacks on the receiver and then into the ""out"" jacks on the turntable.  Then attach the speakers with speaker wire or banana plugs"
445,I'm going for eyes test. How to choose a perfect frame?,u can always try for contacts if you’re really super against glasses ?
446,"Ho do you respond to ""I've dated a black guy before. It's not for me.""","I dated, people are awful, can't honestly recommend it."
447,What is the point of being a good person?,"It makes me feel good to be a good person.

Being a shitty person would make me feel shitty."
448,"Straight men of reddit, why do you shave arms, legs, chest?","What’s being straight got to do with it?

Everyone’s body hair is different, some people don’t like the look of their body hair or the wider issues they may perceive it brings

No one cares whether you think it’s attractive or not"
449,Explosive Diarrhea or Vomiting,"Vomiting is worse to me - acid reflux is rancid, i enjoy eating food and keeping things down, the constant brushing of teeth etc. is annoying 

Diarrhoea is easy to manage you just shit it out and I enjoy Pooing"
450,"If a human got grinded up, what colour would the substance be",Red cos blood
451,"What does crazy, I was crazy once, mean?","Its from a poem that went viral forever ago:

    Crazy? I was crazy once.

    A rubber room with rats.
    They put me in a rubber room with rubber rats.

453,Why do commercials advertise prescription medication?,"People may have chronic conditions, and the drug they've been taking for years kind of sucks.   But that's all there is, so they just get it refilled every 6-12 months.     Now, there's something new for that condition, so maybe it's worth asking about a change.   

People might have chronic conditions, and there was no drug - or the drug available just didn't work.  Now there's a new drug, so it's worth a doctor visit to ask about the new drug.   

People might not like going to doctors.  They have chronic conditions that they just deal with, because their parents and others they spoke to told them there was nothing to do.    Seeing a commercial might wake them up to the fact they might get treatment - so instead of just dealing, they visit a doctor and ask. 

These kinds of ads only happen in New Zealand and the US today."
454,Does anyone feel like eating is a chore? How do you change this mentality?,"me! i do!

it’s just always SO inconvenient!"
455,Did anyone ever take the fall for faking the evidence that caused USA and UK to invade Iraq?,Millions of Iraqis did
456,I made some bad cookies that are still edible. What’s another name I can call them that will lower expectations?,Hurl scout cookies
457,Commuting 62 Miles,"That is a lot of mileage on a vehicle.  That is a HUGE expense for gas and proper vehicle maintenance.    If you correctly report this commute to your auto insurance company, your auto insurance rates will likely go up also.  (most insurance companies want to know how far you drive to work - it is part of the calculation for your insurance.)  It isn't really making more money if that money is going into your gas tank instead of your wallet.

If this salary is based on a 40 hour work week and you are also driving 2 hours per day - then you actually have a 50 hour work week.  You can't really do much to make up for the time spent driving.  (maybe use the time for digital books - otherwise, it is just lost time that was lost because of your job)  Your time is valuable and giving up too much of just to get to and from work is a waste.

If you have no job - then take it.  Anything is better than nothing most of the time.  If you currently have a job, then take a very good look at how much it might cost you to drive so far vs what you spend to get to and from work right now.  Are you really gaining something from changing jobs?  Of course, if you hate your current situation or if this company is your ""dream job"", then the move may be worth it at any cost.  

I am just trying to tell you that sometimes the numbers sound good and look good on paper until you realize how much other things it is costing you for this change.

There is also the consideration of moving closer to the job to reduce the commute if possible.  Work it for a while to make sure you are going to stay there and then move closer."
458,I thought uploading videos to YouTube didn't use up data?,"When you upload something to YouTube, it still needs to download that file to put on there severs."
459,Why do people (especially army) eat crayons?,They're making fun of the army people for being stupid by saying they eat crayons. Like if you were in school you might accuse a fellow student of being a paste eater.
460,"If Napoleon somehow died (assissnation) at the height of the Napoleonic War, who would replace him? His 2nd in command?","This is tricky because there was no real established successor line aside from the general rules of Empirical inherency. There was never a peaceful change of power in the First French Empire, so there was no tradition or custom to follow. 

Depending on when Napoleon died, his son could have taken over. IIRC, when Napoleon abdicated finally in 1815, he named his son as the new Emperor. This is the expect line of succession for an Emperor. Of course, his son was just a boy, so regent would likely be assigned (who that regent would be, it's hard to say).

If Napoleon died before having his son, I could see Joseph Bonaparte (Napoleon's older brother) taking over, or at least having the strongest ""legitimate"" claim.

However, it would unlikely be this simple. There would no doubt be a power struggle between his marshals, his family, and there would likely be a monarchist surge at the time as well."
461,What’s a nice way to ask someone if they don’t want to talk to me when I’m initiating all the conversations,"Try just setting new expectations, if you generally initiate, then theyre expecting you to continue to do so, and thats not necessarily a bad thing. Tell them to that youre a little busy and to hit you up when they have the time. That way, youre subtly telling them to initiate, but youre also testing if they really like you. If they never hit you up, then cut your losses and move on

Hope this helps!"
462,How do the phone companies know who to call when you dial 911?,"> Is it based on where you are?

Yes.

>  What if your GPS isn't working? 

It doesn't use your GPS, since only your phone knows its own GPS coordinates. Your phone is connected to a nearby cellphone tower, so your location for the emergency services is based around the location of the tower.

>  If I visit say China and call 911 who is gonna get my call its not gonna be the local authorities, so what station would get the call and why?

Nobody will get the call, because 911 is an invalid number in China. Countries have different emergency numbers. For example in Europe the number is 112 (however some countries will have 911 or 112 direct to their emergency number)."
463,is he flirting with me or just being nice?,"Not enough info, but off of that you gave I would say probably"
464,Do most people watch reviews just to have their own opinion reaffirmed rather than to hear different opinions in general?,Yes 🤍

466,Would it be harder to go without salt or sugar for the rest of your life?,Salt
467,"In The Martian movie, when the potatoes die, why cant he grow more?","He had no space to grow more. The area where he was able to grow them, after he put in a lot of work to make that possible, was damaged beyond repair with the limited tools and supplies he had."
468,Do all people have a sort of “lazy eye”?,Nobody is completely symmetrical.
469,Why do organisations and countries often not want to accept minority languages as official languages?,"Official language have other ramification, like the right to go to court in that language and stuff like that. Some belgian civil-servant told me that they loose a lot of time with getting every federal document bilingual and making sure that both version of the text say the same things

France is a very centralized country, and one of the first document which built modern France is that XVth century law saying that laws, courts and contracts have to use *Paris French* and no local dialect. Add  Napoleon and the Third republic, and every regional language was killed."
470,who do people not like their family seeing them workout?,"I hate anyone watching me workout. Family is the worst because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about, but they have no issues telling me that whatever I'm doing is wrong. 

I finally had to tell my wife that when I'm in the garage exercising, she is not to come interrupt me under any circumstance or else I was going to add a second deadbolt to the door that locks from the garage side"
471,Why do fan speeds go from 1-2-3-0 instead of 0-1-2-3?,"Because it takes more effort to start the fan to keep it spinning, so the put the highest speed right after to make sure it can get going."
472,Why do football coaches (NCAA/NFL) need personal security,"I am not a sportsball watcher, but I have seen many videos of people getting onto the field in spite of regular security and I've heard of fans who have feelings for coaches that are both very negative and very passionate, so I figure the extra security is prudent."
473,"Women of reddit, is having a gay best friend as a straight male a turnoff? If so, why?","Yes, it matters.  Because if your gf has an adverse reaction to him, then you know she's worthless.

Iy would not matter to me at all if my bf's BFF was gay."
474,What and why's it creepy going to a club alone as a man?,"Nothing creepy about that. You spend your time however you want and with whomever you want. As long as you're not hurting anyone by doing it, it's nobody else's business."
475,Why is there pretty much no representation of Middle East/Middle Eastern people in video games?,"There are a few. Assassin’s Creed, Prince of Persia, the recent Total War: Pharaoh, and many other games set in Egypt.

But yes it’s way less than games set in Japan and “Fantasy Europe”."
476,Why am I so viscerally afraid of spiders?,I feel the same way. Only baby jumping spiders I find cute and not afraid to touch.
477,Why do I sometimes feel a static pulsating feeling in my head and back?,"Hi /u/Hive_of_ants,

478,It’s reported that sperm whale can create sounds up to 233 decibels. It takes at least 185 decibels to kill a person. Can sperm whales really kill us via Fus Ro Dah shout?,"Pretty much, yeah. It's not really a fus ro dah, but hey."
479,Fun things I can do outside by my self?,"Give back to your community through volunteer work. Look into Rotary, as an example."
480,Can someone comfort me for a minute?,"Unfortunately, sometimes in life we can hurt people without meaning to. I think she probably knows you didn’t mean to hurt her, but you did, and if she keeps talking to you it will bring back those bad memories again. 

You did nothing wrong, and hopefully at some point you and she will reach a stage where you are able to talk again. 

Until then,
 
*HUGS*"
481,How do I nicely tell a guy to chill out a little bit? lol,"every time he says something sexual: 

stare at him

don't say anything"
482,What does “based” mean,"Finally, someone asks the real questions!"
483,How do I know what is and isn't a good car?,"Consumer Reports has one of the better auto buying guides.  They compile a lot of data on cost to own, reliability, etc.  They even have lists of suggested used cars in various price ranges.  It would be worth the small subscription cost to access it."
484,Is it normal to mull over a car decision for multiple months?,Just get an old benzo its big enough and tough enough and fast enough geeez
485,Pavegen and Transparent glass solar panels ?,"If you want a photon to produce energy you have to absorb it. Any transparent solar pannel can only ever be some kind of dark glass that absorbs bits and lets throuh other light. That means it does not do the job of a window nor is it a good power source. And it costs like 20 times the price of glass.

The same is true for paving roads, its minimla enercy gains for incredible waste of resources.

Rock on the floor is cheap, highly processed metals, plastics and more on the road is expensive and polluting the environment."
486,Can I make frozen yogurt just by freezing yogurt?,You need to stir it as it freezes. It’s most easily done with an ice cream maker
487,Can hickeys be dangerous?,"There have been cases where they have caused clots which have then resulted in strokes, some fatal.  They are though really fucking rare."
488,Why should I care so much about the opinions of family ?,"its your life, live it how you want then"
489,can i put a clothes drying rack on carpet?,"It shouldn't be a problem. Hang longer items (like pants) towards the top so they don't touch the carpet. Try to have the drying rack as close to a heating source as possible, without it being a fire risk.

You could also place a towel down underneath the drying rack to absorb any drips if you're worried, or place the drying rack in the bathtub (if that's convenient for you)."
490,Just saw a homeless man with a phone,"Hi /u/Fabulous_Air8956,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

491,Do other people define us?,"You define who you are to yourself.  
I decide what you are to me."
492,Why do men get fired and/or written up at jobs for being emotional and/or loud but women don't?,Your personal experience likely doesn’t accurately represent reality. That’s just my take.
493,Has men having to aim to pee vs women who do not have to aim shaped civilization?,"I think you have it backwards. It's the fact that women can't pee standing up that's driven civilization. If women, like men, could easily pee standing up, public urination would have remained a universal thing. Urinating on the side of the road, into a sewer grate, etc would have been the norm. We only would have developed toilets for shitting"
494,"Is yanking a car wheel, making the car swerve back and forth on the highway, considered abuse?","It sounds like it could be psychological abuse, yes.

In any case, abuse or not, he put both your lives in serious danger: that kind of behaviour can cause fatal accidents. I don't know if he was being deliberately abusive, or is suffering from some kind of psychological disorder that could be treated with therapy or medication. Either way, you probably shouldn't be spending your life with a man who might get you killed."
495,"How do Reddit collectible avatars work, and are they an investment?","Robux is currency. Avatars are NFTs. NFTs are scams.

You can spend $25,000 on the most ""unique"" avatar ever but you'd never see any returns because no one would ever want to buy your avatar because it's an NFT and NFTs are scams."
496,Hey have y'all ever do a lock in before?,Your adult friends want to do this too? I'm not knocking the idea I just wouldn't have done that at 21.
497,How do you get over betrayal?,"Damn that first sentence is a good way to put it. It just takes time, giving less thought and energy to the situation will become easier."
498,"What is that ""Fwoosh!"" Sound you hear when things spontaneously combust?","If you're watching a movie or TV show, what you're hearing is a sound effect added in post-production to heighten the drama."
499,Why do backpacks seem more common with adults while out in public now?,The briefcase was determined to be 100% stupid and impractical.
500,Will having gone to a fancy high school haunt me in my adulthood?,No 😂
501,What is the best way to spend time with a dog that doesn’t have much time left?,"Spoil him rotten! I did this with my girl before she passed a few years back. Buy all of his favourite treats, take him for rides in your car, play with his favourite toys, sleep with him, etc.

:)"
502,"Do souls age when they lose their bodies early on?(ie:child murder,premature death,etc)",That would imply an afterlife with the same consciousness and personality that was formulated here. Thats fairytale stuff.
503,Is it very normal in US to video record someone doing any random activity ?,"Not really. If you're watching videos that are viral or trying to be viral, those are probably staged."
504,Why our body want to scratch a mosquito button while it only get worse when we do it ?,"Because it's itchy. Our body only tells us when we are itchy, it is up to the brain to act on the impulse"
505,Is there a term to describe both and only Canadians and Americans?,Former British colonies of North America.
506,How safe is it to eat honey from a random beehive in the wild?,"Your question is unanswerable because you put the word ""random"" in there. 

A beehive deep in the Monongahela wilderness? Probably okay. Enjoy.

A beehive in the forests near the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown site? Or downstream from an industrial farm? I'd think twice."
507,"Those of you who spend 10 minutes checking out when you finally get to the cash-register, what's taking so long?",Are you talking about self-checkout?
508,College football,Everything about Colorado is about ratings. Deion brings eyeballs. The man has all of us staying up to watch two bad programs like it’s a Super Bowl. They’re going to milk this shit for everything it’s worth.
509,Do you think it's bad to desire power and prestige for its own sake?,"Hi /u/HouseElf245,

510,My Female Co worker got me in serious trouble!,If this isn’t a bait story. Record it somehow. Gather evidence and protect yourself.
511,Looking for a new vet?,You call up the vet and ask if they are taking new patients.  Then make an appointment for a checkup.
512,Do people actually think the president controls everything?,"I `__USE__` to think that until I saw how just about everything Trump tried to do was _""blocked by a federal judge in whatever state""_ then I realized that it doesn't actually matter that much who the president is. The entire system is very resistant to change from the top-down. It really has to come from the bottom-up. The public have to really want it."
513,"Weird wet spot randomly appeared on bed, what caused it?","Drool, sweat, insert whatever here. The spot doesn't necessarily appear suddenly, it can take some time for body oils to oxidize, or maybe you just didn't notice it sooner."
514,Is 88% battery after 15 months good for an iPhone 12?,[deleted]
515,"Owners of dog-aggressive dogs, why do you bring them to public places with other dogs?","I had a very ill-tempered Jack Russell Terrier (Terror). He was not a very stranger friendly dog, despite having puppy obedience training and proper socialization. He was just a one-person dog and that person was me. He never left my house without me having a tight hold on his leash, I wasn’t about to get sued because someone’s kid tried to pet my dog and got bit. He didn’t like other dogs either, he was an equal opportunity hater. He crossed the rainbow bridge in April at 15 years old and I sure miss the little monster."
516,How much can the human body regenerate?,"It depends on the tissue lost.

If all you lose is some skin, it can come back. But if you lose  tissue that doesn't regenerate then it won't come back. Heart and brain cells don't regenerate. You have all the heart and brain cells you'll ever have."
517,Do you turn on subtitles/cc's when watching movies/TVs?,Yes always
518,Is it weird to want to tour a foreign country again rather than a new country?,No. There’s too much of Japan to condense in a single trip. It’s an amazing country. And sometimes you just fall in love with a place. Go where you’re happiest.
519,Does anyone else feel like they can’t get a date and like they’re way uglier than their parents?,No.
520,"If you are found not guilty of a crime, then later confess to doing the crime, can you still get in trouble?","""Confessing"" something on a TV show or camera isn't a legal confession."
521,Has technology progress slowed down?,vR Muh dude. Also self driving cars.
522,EX resubscribed to my Disney+ du subscription. Is there anything I can do about it?,Cancel the credit card and report it as a fraudulent charge.
523,"Why do things become less funny (for certain people) once they find out they're fake or scripted, yet TV shows and movies can still be funny?","As a pro wrestling fan, I've wondered this for years. Movies, TV shows, novels, songs, paintings, etc. are all created for other people to enjoy, but pro wrestling is the only one that is ""fake"" and therefore bad."
524,does red lobster actually use the lobsters in the tank,"Yes, you can ask for a specific one to be cooked up for your meal."
525,What the hell is so bad about free insulin?,"Pretty much nothing, other than reduced profits."
526,Should I still apply to stuff that I feel massively under-qualified for?,"No.  

You acknowledge it is your fault that you're severely lacking to be a qualified applicant yet you want to take that from someone who is?"
527,Does this type of building have a name?,Supermarket?
528,is it fucked up to spray paint a spider purple,yes
529,Boiling water and vinegar in a small pot = reaction??,It's called the jumoes reaction. It's totally rad.
530,"If animals could talk, which one would be the best comedian ?",Clown fish
531,"Before there was internet and cell phones, how did EVERY SCHOOL KID in the country learn the same rhymes and songs, like ""bo bo see atten tatten"" (or whatever it is), or ""joy to the world, the teacher's dead,"" or ""jingle bells, batman smells?""","Same way they still do. Word of mouth. Someone says something, it gets repeated and repeated till it's everywhere.

Something going viral happened long before the internet."
532,Is there a way this girl would be interested in men,"Out of the ~8 billion or so people in the world, only one knows the answer.    Talk to her."
533,There were kids at the Bobert peep show.,"When men walk around topless on a beach in front of little kids, zero people give a shit, kids included. 

People need to get over this weird legalized fetish over women's nipples."
534,How do you read laundry detergent dosage caps?,"Just put in a reasonable amount and see how it goes. Unless your clothes are filthy,you probably dont need as much as you think."
535,Why are trench coats associated with school shootings?,"There was a group of people at Columbine high school called the trench coat mafia. They were basically nerds and outcasts. Eric Harris briefly was a part of that clique, though he was on the periphery of it and never actually a part of it. But that story got repeated so many times that everyone thinks the Columbine shooters wore trench coats all the time."
536,What subreddits are ok with me saying retard? Don't want to get banned for breaking the rules.,How often do you find yourself needing to use that word that this is an issue?
537,What’s the right way to avoid bee stings?,Hell idk if I’m allergic. How do you find that out ?
538,Can food have maggots if it's not rotten?,yes

540,Are there any non-Latino Spanish Americans in the US?,Yes there are Spanish Americans.
541,How does Matt Gaetz have the power to oust Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House?,McCarthy agreed to this in order to become Speaker. It only takes one person to start a vote to get rid of him.
542,What’s an example of a sentence where you would use ‘flabbergasted’ in?,I'm flabbergasted that you've been using it wrong.
543,Why are so many more vegan women rather than men?,Interesting question! Perhaps it's related to women generally being more health-conscious.
544,Is Generation Z really becoming more Luddite/Technophobic?,"Not that I've noticed. I have noticed that, being used to Android and IOS on phones and tablets that they often lack skills with more traditional desktops and laptops. The concept of what a file is, and where it is located in a filesystem made up of nested folders, is very hard to teach them, they're used to using apps that hide the underlying filesystem from them. But it's not technophobia, it's just anxiety about learning something new."
545,Am I still insane if I smile to myself in public but realize I’m doing it?,"It's, uh. It's not insane to smile in public in the first place."
546,Is my hair supposed to look greasy and terrible after only 1 day of not showering?,"Your’s… maybe. Someone else… maybe not. All depends on your biological makeup. I’m an oily guy who has to wash everyday. Benefit, I look about 10-15 years younger because I don’t wrinkle. My wife has fairly dry skin, she can go days w/out washing her hair and it still looks and smells great. It’s all your biology."
547,"I think I'm catching feelings for another person but I'm in a relationship, what do I do?","Feelings and people change, and sometimes relationships just don’t satisfy like they once did. You can still love your girlfriend and not be in love with her, which sounds like the case if you’re finding yourself catching feelings for another girl. The best thing to do in this kind of situation is to really think it over and decide if your existing relationship is worth salvaging or if you’d like to see where things could go with this other girl. Either way, you’re not a bad guy just because your feelings have changed. It’s normal, especially when you’re a teenager, to sometimes grow apart from people over time. If you do decide to see where things go with the new girl, just be sure you’re doing right by the current one and respect her enough to leave her first rather than end up cheating on her."
548,do yellow jackets remember people?,There is some evidence to suggest that wasps and honey bees can recognize faces.  https://theconversation.com/are-they-watching-you-the-tiny-brains-of-bees-and-wasps-can-recognise-faces-100884
549,How do I tell someone they won’t be hired back next summer for a seasonal job?,"My summer job used to give us three options- rehire, reinterview, or don’t come back. If they’re good kids you could give them the reinterview option and see if they’ve matured come next summer. Kids can make a big jump when it comes to responsibility in just one school year."
550,I Have hair like underarm hair and facial hair it means I done growing I am turning 17,Not necessarily. Body hair growth doesn’t indicate that your physical growth has stopped. You could still have a couple inches in you or you could be done.
551,Can the UAW be disbanded?,Found the corporate capitalist union buster!
552,Why does 60 degrees at Night in september feel different than 60 degree nights in July?,"Probably humidity. Water transfers heat faster than air. So, cold air with high humidity takes heat from your body faster than the same temperature air with low humidity."
553,How many nuclear weapons does any country actually have ready to go at any time?,Pretty sure that information isn't know to the public by design.
554,"I was reading a book on the Internet Archive and now I can no longer access it because it says it's, ""only available to those with print disabilities,"" now. How do I get print disabilities to be able to finish the book? Thanks in advance.","That's usually temporary because someone checked it out, you'll be able to access it again at some point like a digital library book"
555,"on a youtube someone said ""in the history of man, recordable media has evolved into VHS tapes twice? If it happens one more time it will have tied with lobsters."" What does he mean by the lobster bit?","They actually mean crabs, a weird phenomenon in biology where multiple animals have [evolved crab-like species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation)."
556,Paying a subscription with expired card,Maybe they forgot to charge and it was a mistake in their system?
557,"Do you ask other women in the bathroom, if they have a tampon?","Back when I would need them, if I didn't have them and needed them, yes."
558,Moon rise at 9AM?,"There's this misconception that the moon is only out at night. This is in no way true. In fact, if it was, there'd never be solar eclipses. 

The monition of the moon and the sun are not really connected."
559,How come some people know how to draw and others don’t?,"Different people's brains are wired differently. I'm really good at learning languages. I know plenty of people who *suck* at it. Likewise, I absolutely suck at drawing. 

We're all different."
560,"Why does Marvel sell more comics than DC? Even before the MCU, Marvel had bigger comic sales than DC.","they don't always sell more.  in 1999 DC sold more.  

https://images.app.goo.gl/1hxXLpdpypZC4TjV9"
561,Why doesent OSHA decibel limitations apply to concerts as it would the workplace?,"They’re concerned with occupational health and safety. You sort of have to go to work, so OSHA makes sure that you’re not obligated to take on unnecessary risk by doing so. 

Concerts are a leisure activity, you can easily not go or bring your own ear plugs if you’re unwilling to risk hearing damage. 

As for employees of the production or venue, the employer would be required to provide hearing protection."
562,If I’m really looking for good anonymous advice what’s the best platform to ask?,Reddit ?
563,Does she hate me? :(,"I expect that Tanya was also warned against speaking to you. She had not only her job to lose but also her marriage. I don't think there's anything here to indicate that she hates you, just that she chose to keep her job and her marriage over flirting with you."
564,Can recovering alcoholics use nonalcoholic drinks as an aid?,"Yes they do. This is the reason Liquid Death water exists: it's water packaged like beer so that recovering alcoholics can go to bars, concerts etc and socialise without drinking alcohol or feeling self conscious about their choice."
565,I took old medication and then had federal drug test. Freaking out. Could I test positive?,"Hi /u/BBpercoPill,

566,What are the limits of human exploration in the universe?,Depends on how much time you are willing to spend as an astronaut on a one way ticket to death.
567,Am I being selfish for peoples sad stories to make me cry?,"This is likely empathy. 

And extreme of it would be histrionic personality disorder, where you make others’ sadness fully your own, but that isn’t what it sounds like."
568,On a scale of 1-10 how risky is this text?,"I don't think you gave them many avenues of response.

Like, if someone sent that to you, how would you reply?"
569,Why do people still joke about Australia being a prisoner colony when Georgia doesn’t get joked on for being a debtor colony?,Americans don't have a good grasp of world history.
570,Something near light speed approaching a camera,"Cameras don't ""see"" anything, they just take photos of whatever they're pointed at. A still camera takes one image each time you press the button. Movie cameras take anywhere from 50 to 1,000 pictures per second, but even at 1,000 pics per second.

An object moving at light speed or anywhere near it wouldn't movie slowly enough to be recorded unless the object was many millions of miles away at the start, and so large that you could see it from that distance. That would basically be like a planet sized asteroid, and it would move in and out of any kind of visual standpoint so quickly that it would be pure freakish luck if you could take a picture of it at all, and even if you got lucky the object would just look like a blur, even at a rate of 1,000 photos per second.

In short, there's nothing that could move at that speed that's also big enough to be seen if it was moving anywhere near light speed. Something the size of a jet wouldn't be within range of sight for more than like 0.000000000000000001 seconds"
571,Why is my reddit feed not showing good effort posts on certain subreddits?,"Reddit's app sucks quite a bit. ""Oh you interact with this sub? Cool! You're going to see it every fifth post to infinity."" (The fourth post is an ad and the cycle continues.)"
572,Why do babies randomly hit their parents? 🤣,Depends on the age. A really little baby might just be figuring out how arms work and flailing around. A toddler might do it to express frustration. And sometimes babies do things just to study reactions and understand the world - this is a big part of chucking stuff off high chairs.
573,How do you find meaning in your life?,"You don't really find meaning you pick meaning you decide what the meaning of your life is going to be for yourself. 

If you feel like your life has meaning then it does, if you feel like your life has purpose then it does, if you feel fulfilled in your actions then you are fulfilled. 

There's no other meaningful metric to gauge meaning in life."
574,How often do you take a dump?,"Depends on activity and diet. Generally once a day, but very often twice a day."
575,"Am I colorblind? I’ve had debates in the past about white vs. green and gray vs. blue. Tonight, it was suggested perhaps I am colorblind. I am female so I never thought possible.","You could be. Google ""colorblindness test"" and you'll get some very easy, quick tests you can use to check."
576,What will happen when we run out of oil?,"Back in the mid-90s when crude oil prices spiked there was a push to convert vehicles to run on natural gas with the tagline ""The stone age didn't end because we ran out out stones"", so there is always a plan-B that is currently just a little too expensive to compete.

That said: Google peak oil failed predictions to gain an understanding why no one over 30 takes these ""out of oil by 20XX"" predictions seriously"
577,"What time do you, go to bed and get up? Normal day vs weekend?","Normal day 10:00 get up 6:00.

Weekend 10:00 get up 6:00.

I have a child and a cat."
578,How much time is needed to learn Python quickly?,"Depends how complicated the project is. Also depends if you've done a bit of programming before and understand how it works. For programming stuff I've had to do for uni in Matlab and Arduino I just jumped in. Anything I didn't understand or know how to do I just looked it up, watched 5 mins of a YouTube video and solved the problem."
579,Are live broadcasters for sports events televised on the popular network given teleprompted scripts to read that are written by someone else and served up to them?,"Not usually, no.

Now line the ruler up against (the outer end of) each pair of marks on either side of the paper and lightly draw a line between them. Afterwards use a soft eraser to remove the lines."

587,Can you like someone you've never met?,"Of course you can. You can even like a celebrity you’ve never talked to or met. The thing to keep in mind is that you’re only liking what you see. Sometimes you really like someone you meet online, but everything you like about that person is only a fraction of who they really are, and you find out later about the rest of them and you don’t like it. Or you find out they’re dangerous in some way to you. 

You can absolutely like someone you haven’t met, just keep in mind that the version of them you see might not include everything about them."

593,Does anyone actually upvote ads or are they just gaming me?,"The people who pay for them upvote the ads.

They do make plastic zippers. They don't last as long as metal ones."
604,What's the problem?,"The more likely and simple answer is that your friend was using a prepaid SIM card and she allowed it to expire and the number got assigned to someone else.

You could just find someway to ask her or her family/friends to check up on her and relay to you current contact info for your friend."
605,Is it normal for my knees to pop when they bend? My wrists pop too?,"Yeah, its normal, welcome to existing as a watery bag of meat and bones held together by rubber bands. Youre gonna make some funny noises.

On a serious note though, its fine. Nothing to worry about unless theres pain or discomfort or it looks messed up. My knees pop a lot, but my ankles are ridiculous. Literally every few steps they pop. 

I think the science reason is that during normal everyday activity gas pockets can form in the fluid in your joints, and when you move them a certain way the gas expels and makes a popping noise. Same noise as cracking ur knuckles. Dont quote me on that tho, been a while since i knew that for sure."
606,Where do you draw the line for prostitution being an exploitation or a choice,"When it comes down to it, a very small percentage of sex workers are doing it because they enjoy the work they do. The vast majority are doing it because it’s the easiest way for them to make money.  So while I firmly believe a grown ass adult should be allowed to engage in sex work if they so choose. I’d prefer to see us change the world to one where sex work isn’t the best option for young women and men to live a decent life."

Decided to wander around the city after and met a full on Pirate Ship crew that was doing a practice run before they started their themed party cruise business the next weekend. Got a free ride on a pirate ship and dropped off in a part of the city I’d never seen before. I’ll probably never top that as far as shenanigans go. 

So yeah they happen. Being in a big city and going out opens up the possibility of shenanigans. Doesn’t guarantee them, but better odds than sitting around on Reddit."
610,Will we ever run out of water?,Don't ask ChatGPT questions and expect good answers. Water supply has nothing to do with conservation of energy.
611,"Scenario: You're god, how should the universe *be* and why?","I will stop human from creating plastic, processed food, certain weapons like gun/bomb/missiles, phone with cameras.

Short version is that your body develops the ability to deliver more oxygen to the tissues, and the ability to use more oxygen to develop the energy needed to respond to the metabolic demand. 

BTW, initially, people gain strength from lifting by learning to use the muscle mass they have more efficiently to generate more force. Most people can double their strength levels without much increase in muscle mass. Eventually, yes, muscle size has to increase its cross-sectional area to continue to increase strength, but increased strength has a significant neural component."
617,Did I get scammed?,You sent the item without confirming you received payment?
618,Sleeping fully clothed,"When I was a teenager I slept fully clothed a lot. No real reason for it, for me anyway. Sometimes it was just easier to sleep in my school clothes so I could just get up and do my hair and teeth. As for how to address it.. i would just let it be? If he’s comfortable, he is just comfortable."

It closed after a while since we didn’t use it, I worked retail as well so I didn’t mind."
627,How did France exactly manage to amass 1 million soldiers during the Napoleonic War in a time of anarchy and rebellion within the country?,"*Most of the men in Napoleon’s Grand Armée were conscripts drawn from the poorer classes. Every able-bodied man of age in France was expected to willingly join the ranks to defend the Republic – or risk losing citizenship. In theory soldiers were eligible for discharge after five years, but after 1804, most discharges were only for medical reasons. Most new soldiers received little training, and had to learn their trade on the battlefield.*

Not every station does this, but it’s been a practice some stations have used for decades. A station might play 10-12 songs in an hour.

If you speed them up even more, it generates even more sellable time."

656,Why don't shops get sued for their own rip off products,"Because blatant is subjective.

Nutella doesn't own the whole concept of chocolate spread. So the question becomes how close is too close?

There are people who will describe more precise parameters—e.g. 2 sec concentric, 4 sec eccentric—but that is not really important.

697,Car Insurance More Expensive? UK,I think so. Try asking at r/askUK
698,Would complimenting a bartender's tattoo be seen as flirting?,We need more details. Impossible to say rn.
699,Would I be breaking any laws if I used Whisper AI to record and thus transcribe phone calls?,"Depends which state. If you live in a state which has two party consent laws, it would be illegal. If not, then it would not."
700,Outside of USA is there places in other countries that have American pockets?,"In many places in Asia and in Australia, American culture is already pretty ubiquitous, so it's less than they assimilate into our cultures and more we have assimilated theirs.

What would a Little America look like anyhow? Pizza and burger joints? Ribs & grill? We got that all over here already.

edit: one more thing, Americans don't immigrant, they expat. It's a different mindset that results less in establishing ethnic enclaves."
701,U.S.A. Drone Flight Data,"[FlightAware](https://www.flightaware.com) is a good source, but I think you need to pay for historical data.

[They have instructions on how to build your own ADS-B receiver](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build/) if you want to setup your own flight monitoring near you."
702,When you live with someone does your bathroom habits sync up?,"I don't know, but my wife and I lived for quite a while in places with just a single bathroom, and it really was a problem.  So many years ago we finally moved into a house with 2.  And it was so much better."
703,Why do men think that pants that end two inches above the ankles is a good look?,what is good is subjective
704,Is it too much to ask my landlord this?,"Absolutely say something! My partner and I started renting a home that wasn’t well cared for by the previous tenants & the property managers never checked it over before giving us the keys. Beyond many issues we’re still sorting out, we put maintenance requests in about the fridge (wasn’t keeping cold, leaked coolant) and dishwasher (heating element rusted, filter dirty beyond salvaging). We didn’t ask for replacements, but when the maintenance/appliance folks saw the photos, they told our management that both appliances needed to be replaced. So, now we have new appliances! As renters, we pay $$$ to landlords so they can handle these situations for us. Best of luck to you both!"
705,How do you forgive yourself for messy mistakes in the past?,"First, were these actually ""mistakes""?  Or were they conscious bad acts/negligence/carelessness?

Consider dealing with what you did for what it is, rather than calling it an ooopsie as if you'd stepped on the dog's tail in the dark.

Then, learn this mantra:  *That was me THEN. THIS is me NOW.* And remind yourself that you've learned your lesson and never want to cringe about anything else anymore, so you're going to avoid making decisions as you did in the past."
706,What exactly is an eccentric character?,"""Eccentric"" Basically just means ""weird, but in a wealthy/charming way""."
707,Can active duty soldiers from different armies get married?,"As far as I know, there shouldn't be any policies preventing them from getting married."
708,"why do the early 1900s feel ""retro"" but the late 1800s (only a decade apart) feel like the middle ages?",They didn't have electricity. That's the main thing that differs from 18 to 1900.
709,How would an object spinning at light speed work?,">the point 10m away must be moving at a much higher speed

For speeds that we encounter on a day-to-day basis, yes. For speeds that approach the speed of light, [velocity addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula) gets more complicated than 1+1=2. Time dilation makes the whole thing *very* unintuitive.

>Would I be prevented from spinning this quickly

In practice, attempting to spin that quickly would destroy you, or the stick, or both. I'll share a [relevant post from XKCD](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/) as an illustration of how ridiculous these scenarios can get."
710,If a 18 year old makes alcohol at home would they get in trouble even if the people drinking it are 21 or older,ABC will kick down your door and burn your house to the ground. You are safer cooking meth
711,"Why have coffee shops become positively bare, uncomfortable, and often dirty spaces recently?",So people will stop camping out there?
712,How do you avoid that awkward half-cheek-kiss-half-hug when you’re not sure if your family is going for a hug or a cheek kiss or both?,let them come to you then and see what they do
713,Should your savings go up in value?,It depends on what you are saving.
714,How do I find shows that both me and my dad will like?,"It’s your dad, surely there’s something on his list that is moderately interesting to you? Watch that. 

Some of the cooking competitions are kinda fun. I’ll enjoy Chopped or Beat Bobby Flay."
715,Using Peppermint Castile Soap To Repel Bugs,"You can do this because it won’t hurt you, but I wouldn’t recommend using soap as it’ll leave a film on everything. 

Using peppermint-oil solution would be better, although that, too, might leave marks. You need just a few drops in a spray bottle of distilled water — shake every time you use it, and test on a hidden spot if you’re going to spray it on fabric. 

You can also probably use peppermint extract/water, but the extract isn’t as strong as the oil."
716,"I'm curious- what do orgasms feel like for other women? Ladies, can you describe your different types of orgasms?",Damnn. It's just the sexual sighing with squirting for us men. 🥹
717,How do I deal with someone triggered by something I said or did?,"If this happens a lot, it sounds like you're the one who doesn't know how to be professional."
718,Propane: Is it common for people to use PVC pipe for the supply line from the propane tank to the house?,Never.
719,Is the sun’s path taken into consideration when building an open-top stadium?,"It is. And they purposely put the visiting team in on the worse side. It’s unfair. It’s on purpose.

Tbh idk if your exact example is even unfair or consistently unfair depending on the time of day. But that kind of thing does happen in general. In cold weather outdoor stadiums away teams would often be in shade that was way colder than the home teams side."
720,Can someone help me come up with a cool username using my name? Its Daryle,"Hi /u/NoSatisfaction6751,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

721,"Why do I ALWAYS get hungry, then fall asleep ASAP.","If I’m understanding this correctly, you smoke, then eat a whole bunch, and then fall asleep. 

This is completely normal. I’m assuming you’re talking about smoking weed. In that case, both intense cravings/hunger and tiredness are symptoms of a being high. Smoking often makes people really hungry, this is called the munchies. Being high can also make you really tired/drowsy."
722,If the mods were paid would they be better?,"If it was a paid position, there'd be a lot more oversight, accountability, actual job descriptions and requirements, etc. 

Having said that, while mods don't get paid in actual money, there have been times when mods were in fact compensated. This involves reddit hosting mod get-togethers for all mods in a specific city, subscriptions to other websites, etc."
723,If we can modify organisms to do all sorts of things why can't we create ocean going anti yeast and then let it grow,"There is an idea to dump phosphorus into the oceans, causing algae blooms, which captures co2, and sink to the bottom.  It's been tested, but would require billions of dollars of phosphorus, with no financial return."
724,"I just found out my best friend (f) friend is in love with me (f) through her brother, after 10 years of being friends. She’s about to get married next month to her boyfriend of 4 years. Should i confront her or let it be?","Wait. Your best friend is in love with you but about to be married to someone she's dated for 4 years and you got this info second hand? If she was in love with you she would tell you herself, no questions asked. Even so, are you going to break up a relationship because of it? How do you feel about her? I would just be supportive of her choices, honestly. If she wanted you she'd be with you."
725,"Why do those interviewing candidates for a mid-level job look either depressed, like a robot, or trying to hard to be composed and happy?","Generally it’s extremely stressful. You usually have to fit 20 interviews into your schedule, follow a very mundane repeatable process, keep impeccable notes for legal discovery in case somebody cries foul play, and justify your choice to the next scrutinizing asshole up the food chain."
726,Is this scabbing?,"No, because you're not replacing the workers to the benefit of the employers."
727,Are men's cologne commercials geared toward men or women ?,its mostly to appeal to guys who strive to live/look/be that conmercial man. and maybe women who what that of their man. all ads are meant to just live rent free in peoples head anyhow
728,Is Tesla build quality really not great?,Yeah Tesla build quality and QC are pretty embarrassing at the price point of those cars. It's the sort of stuff you'd expect on bargain basement compact cars or budget Chinese imports.
729,Am I the only one that gets turned off by incessant targeted marketing?,You aren't alone. I see this same basic question posted frequently. But such advertising does work on enough people to be profitable.
730,how do i do this?,"I had this exact same conundrum last year with a guy I liked who I’d make very brief eye contact with constantly and said maybe five words total to him. On the paper I was going to give to him, I just said that I thought he was really cute and listed some of the things I liked about him. I wrote how he gave me butterflies and how much I wanted to be with him. Then I just signed my name and wrote down my number. I was planning on setting it on his desk as soon as I walked into class one day, as he was always in class by the time I arrived. Unfortunately, I never worked up the courage and now I’ve graduated so I may never get the chance to actually confess to him. Don’t make the same mistake I did!"
731,Problems with USPS?,"In my experience, it's been an issue with the distribution center. We had some issues here in my neck of the woods for a while last year. A lot of returned mail. Folks were pissed. Hopefully your stuff gets to you soon, buddy"
732,I have a friend (29f) that has a boyfriend. But I think she has a syndrome that makes her look like 12 years old (physically) do you think that makes the guy a pedophile ??,"I think you're way too preoccupied by physical appearance and trying to read other people's minds.

You may even be projecting."
733,Hollywood writers strike,"Two main things. The first was the question of residuals when it comes to streaming. Writers in the past have negotiated lower pay in exchange for residuals. Since writing is a volatile field, even accomplished writers may be out of work for months at a time between shows. This is why residuals where worth it over a lower pay rate. That way if you had a successful show that tends to run reruns, you have consistent income even between jobs. The problem is that since we are moving more and more towards streaming, residuals dont really make sense the way they used to. A big part of the negotiation are about new ways to calculate residuals that make sense with modern streaming.

The other big problem is that writing for a streaming service sort of sucks. There has been a big push to make writing more like the gig economy. Where writers are rotated between projects with very little long term prospects. There are jobs to be had, but the expectation is that those jobs dont last more than a few months by design. Obviously volatile employment is nothing new to writers, but the dream of writing for a long term successful show is becoming more and more elusive. Even if you do write for a successful show, you still cant build a career out of it.

These are the big issues."
734,"What is it called when you have a temporary habit of doing something constantly like biting your lip, grinding your teeth, clenching your jaw, etc. ?",tic
735,"(Not American) How can servers get paid under minimum wage without tips, isn't the whole point of minimum wage that you can't get paid less than it?",But they do get tips so they do make at least minimum wage. If they didn't get tips then they'd be paid minimum wage. They like tips because it usually gets them considerably more than minimum wage
736,Why is Saudi Arabia spending billions of dollars on soccer players?,"More money than sense simple as that. Look at the wwe shows, the Saudi Prince of wherever pays 10s of millions for them. 

It's essentially someone being so wealthy they do whatever they want"
737,I have a question about PayPal? Can you help me?,"This sounds suspiciously like a paypal /r/scams. 

Who is sending you this money, and why?"
738,What are the top social rules that some people miss?,read body language
739,Were there people who hated specifically swords like people who hate firearms today?,"Sort of?

There were plenty of sword laws and sword bans."
740,is there any developmental effects from watching gore as a kid?,If you have to ask you already know the answer.
741,"Im dutch but speak english close to, or even at a native level, is there any career for this?","Not really. According to Google, it's estimated that 90% of Dutch people are proficient in English so you're par for the course. Being proficient in English as a European is an expectation depending on what kind of job you'll have, so you'll have to develop some other sort of skill to be competitive."
742,How is possible to be slow at running?,I look forward to the day you announce your 3-minute mile.   Just keep moving your legs faster.
743,How can water be wasted if it goes through the water cycle?,"Water in reservoirs around Albany New York don't help people in Algeria who are in drought.     The water cycle doesn't drop water back where you need it - most of it goes into the ocean where is remains undrinkable.   

If you're in Algeria and you fill up your kiddy pool, water your lawn, wash your car, and take 30 minute showers, you are wasting a limited resource.    The rain falling in other places like Albany, NY means the total of water on Earth stays the same, but that balance won't help you stay alive any longer."
744,"Why do Atlantic coastal states (FL, SC, NC, VA, MD) have lots of popular beaches but Georgia doesn’t?",Beaches are not easily accessible in Georgia.  The best beaches  are in marshes.
745,"Non-native English speakers, how the hell did you learn when to use the prepositions ""in"" and ""on"" when there's no grammatical rule/guide for them?","Well I can't say for everyone, but atleast for me, once you get familiar with the language, you can kind of guess which one to use. Idk, if this makes sense to you? 
How I learned english is mostly due exposure to the english language. I grew up watching a lot of english/american shows. Or even anime where the spoken language would be japanese but the subtitles in english. So as I grew up with this kind of exposure, you automatically get familiar with for example, in this case, prepositions that don't really have any grammatical ruling. That aside, if I did make mistakes, I still got corrected when I was in secondary school as english (it was standard british english though) was and still is a mandatory class you have to take. 

That aside, what also might be the reason is because I'm from a country where we have multiple official languages. So I already got exposed to a different language outside my native one from a young age in school( I'm talking about 8-9 years old, that would be 3rd grade for you guys right?). So I might pickup those grammatical rulings (that technically don't make any sense) in languages faster than maybe other people who never really got exposed to a different language from a young age."
746,whats stopping us from putting waste under water,other than us poisoning the oceans is a bad thing?
747,Can a vampire enter your home with a warrant?,"The way it's usually expressed is that a vampire can't enter the home uninvited. Ownership of the home isn't the point. The point is that it's your home, and your home is your castle. This leads me to think that (A) another invited guest doesn't have the authority to issue invitations but that (B) the courts do have that authority, within the limits of the law.

If the vampire is a cop or other official acting under a court order in his official capacity, I think he can enter the house uninvited. But only to do what the warrant specifies."
748,What if all animals could communicate and understand humans?,"If they're also intelligent enough to understand humans, I imagine the world would get taken over by an ant supercolony."
749,"If you are traveling at .99c, in a void with nothing relative of your position, and you shine a light in front of you. That light will move away relative from you at 1c. Are you still technically moving at .99c?","The speed of light is a constant.  It's always measured as the speed of light relative to all observers.  

You see the light moving away from you at 1c.  

The starting point observer sees you moving away from them at 0.99c and the light moving away from your ship relative to them at 1c.  They see the light moving away from your ship at 0.01c.  

You see, when you look back at the starting point observer's clock it's running slow from your point of view.  When they look at yours it is yours running slow from their point of view.  You measure the distance you've travelled as shorter than the starting point observer does.  They measure your ship as being shorter than you do.  And so on and so forth.  All of this adds up to everyone seeing the speed of light as a constant."
750,Helpful info drug testing!!!!,"Cannabis generally will not stay in your system longer than a week, for urine tests."
751,Did our taste change to enjoy meat or did meat already taste good,"Evolution favors nutrient-dense food.

Meat is very high in protein, often high in fat and calories.

So yes, humans likely always liked meat."
752,Why so I always need to have a crush on someone?,Why so I always need a grammar make sense do?
753,How long have barbers been doing Hard Parts?,"Whats the question? 

How long have they been doing it? No one knows because it wasnt important enough to document its history, but it was starting to reach popularity in the early, mid, and late 1900s. Middle parts have been a thing for a very very very long time though, dating to ancient civilization

Or is the question does anyone else think the same? I dont personally because i never really thought about it, cant speak for other people"
754,What CPU is the best value for 4K video editing and 3D rendering?,Maybe try /r/buildmeapc
755,What does ‘3 minutes to yesterday’ mean?,I have never heard this before. Is it possible you misheard?
756,Car Insurance fraud?,"(1) Get on the insurance.  If you are in a US state, your state's motor vehicle department may suspend your license & registration if you have a registered car / good tags, but do not have insurance.  Let them know you are not driving, and turn in your plates/tags if you need to until you get insurance.   

(2) Do you really have the paperwork and evidence to go back over things from 2021?   You're going to have to convince the other person's insurance company to reopen the case and pay for things.   In some states, things are ""no - fault"", so each side pays their own damages.    For you to overturn this, you probably need to show more than just a communication error.  You almost certainly got a letter when it was over, showing all your insurance paid.   
You would need to show that your insurer did not pay for your rental, and/or convince the other side to pay for the rental and any other expenses your insurer had.   

(3) Insurance ""points"" are different than motor vehicle record points.    The insurance companies know if we plea down a speeding ticket - we still get insurance points.   They assign points if we are in an accident, and more points if they have to pay.    Every insurer gets to make up their own point system.   

Good luck."
757,"People over 30, do you ever feel like a loser for still renting? Obviously I know the economy, but I can't help how I feel sometimes.","No.  We bought a home at 30, sold at 42 and agreed we didn't want to own."
758,Do you add water to a crock pot pork tenderloin if so how much?(cooking beginner here),I prefer apple juice and I cover about half.
759,"Is it possible for your body to have problems regulating your chemicals, whereby consuming alcohol fixes the problem?","Alcohol doesn't regulate body chemistry in any way, so . . . No. That's not to say that the effects of alcohol can never have a beneficial effect. But alcohol never cures a problem."
760,"Is it possible for a physical and visible object to be so destroyed that everything of it is dissipated, or will its molecules always linger?","Hi /u/No_Appearance_731,

761,Are pets slaves?,"Pets are neither human nor directly controlled, so they do not meet any definition of enslaved."
762,What do you call a people pleaser who gets angry and seeks revenge when people do not appreciate the effort?,An asshole
763,Universe-Designed Food Measurement,No. You’d have to look into it with a lot more detail than you could do outside of a lab to know if it was a gmo or whatever other worry you have is. Get it from your own garden from seeds you chose yourself if that’s what you want. Although there’s such little difference between things being breed with cross breeding or selective breeding or manhandled scientific breeding that a lab might not even be able to tell wherever you’re drawing your line.
764,"I i clone a hard drive, would I need to update paths?","If it is truly cloned, no. A proper clone should be identical in all ways to the previous one. Therefore, the paths would all be identical.

The only difference to the software or the computer should be the capacity of the new drive. This should have zero impact on any software or hardware except for the exact capacity is important."
765,Too much oil?,No worries. You can consume quite a bit of olive oil before it becomes an issue.
766,Perpetual energy?,"I apologize. Perpetual energy was a bit of a premature thought. I'm aware of the loss of energy but for argument sake, wouldn't such a setup with for an extended period of time? Something like an ice box/cooler that would be able to keep items cold for longer and occasionally need to be powered/recharged?"
767,"If you cook chicken broth in quinoa instead of plain water, will it taste good or just not taste right afterwards?","Plenty of times, depending on my tastes that day.

It doesn't do anything particularly unexpected. Just makes the quinoa taste a little chicken-y, which is precisely what you'd expect."
768,"What are small, niche, weird, but important things I could do that would help others tremendously","Be nice, donate, invite a lonely person to a Thanksgiving dinner (that immigrant dude working at the gas station), friend lonely people, buy food gift cards for homeless people, be patient, forgiving and kind to family & friends and stay in touch with them"
769,Is this a predator?,"If someone casually talked like that about seeing children in that way to me I'd let everyone around me know it instantly. ""Excuse me did I just hear you say you watch these children undress?"" There is no way she'd find herself around my son again thats for sure and I'm super concerned for what that young girl deals with behind closed doors."
770,Does the US have a major problem with abandoned pets?,"The US?!

As an American who's spent years abroad I've got to laugh at that. Other countries have so many stray animals that they're not even interesting conversation at a bar.

You see posts about it specifically because abandoned pets are so rare here. You've let social media twist your head completely backwards."
771,"If you had $1 per karma point, what would you buy?","Two chicks at the same time. That's what i'd buy, man."
772,What do people do during a minute/moment's silence?,You think about the thing you’re observing a moment of silence for. You reflect on the severity of it and you hold space in your mind and heart for the people affected.
773,Can a military track it's OWN stealth aircraft?,"Yes they can track all of their vehicles and weapons with GPS and other systems.

Otherwise if you created a stealth fleet and couldn't track them the moment you built them or launched them you'd lose them pretty much. Kind of like that Batman movie with his stealth helicopter thing and they make a comment of remembering where are you parked it."
774,How do I politely deal with customers who won’t stop talking to me?,"“Next in line, please”.  

Hopefully the chatty Cathys will get the hint that there’s other people waiting"
775,Serious question. Do you feel embarrassed when you sneeze or cough in public?,No.
776,What's your BMI?,"It’s a number calculated based off of your height and weight, that is supposed to be used to determine if you’re overweight, underweight, obese, etc."
777,Why is American football so popular?,"Think about all the reasons why association football is popular.

American football is popular for the same reasons.

The military thing doesn't have much to do with it. And some states have multiple teams, so the idea of states rivaling each other doesn't seem spot-on."
778,How do I know if high school is teaching me everything they should in STEM education? How can I augment my education?,You can read for your own interest.  The library is full of stuff that covers those topics.
779,"When they say that somewhere is guarded, what do they mean?","They aren't going to tell us specifics.  

They usually use layers of security.   Fences & walls,  cameras, live security people,  gates with restricted access,  secondary gates & doors,  more cameras,  limited access to keys or swipe cards,  requiring everyone - even your own boss to show their ID,   snipers in surrounding buildings,  drones or satellites watching traffic patterns,  devices to monitor sewers, mirrors to monitor cell phones or radio traffic in the area - and several other steps.   

Back in the late 80s, I was on a security team that watched about 200 cameras around lower NYC during the overnight & morning rush hour.   They created games for us to keep us alert.  One game would be someone with a special sign on a backpack.   Once a week, they'd come through unannounced during our shift.  The first person who found them would get an extra 30 minutes added to lunch that day, plus a $50 Savings Bond.    If someone else missed that person through 3 of their assigned zones, they'd lose 30 minutes from their lunch.  (We had a 1 hour paid lunch)"
780,Anyone here ever been to the Trees of Mystery in Northern California?,That’s the place with the giant Paul  Bunyan and Babe the blue ox statues? It just seems like a place to sell curios and souvenirs.
781,What app or service will you never use again and why?,"AltaVista.

Miss you my dude. I always thought you were better than Google, but the rest of the world didn't agree. /teardrop"
782,Yankees and beer,"What's a yankee? You don't mean the baseball team, do you?"
783,What arm or pocket do you wear your watch? (Phones also),Arm opposite of dominant. Pocket dominant side.
784,Older brother barely talks to me any more; how can we reconnect?,"Sounds like therapy could help him more than you ever could. Obviously you can’t force him to to that.

Does he have any hobbies? Maybe you could invite him out to do things that are related to his interests? I would try to take him to free events or out in nature, so there wouldn’t be any embarrassment if he couldn’t pay his own way. 

Or invite him to out with mutual friends, or groups of people. Just show some sort of interest in spending time together that has nothing to do with his “future” or starting some business with him. 

It sounds like everything he worked so hard for in his adult life came crashing down around him. He needs to rebuild his confidence, and feel valued as a person for who he is and what he has accomplished. Not constantly reminded of his failures."
785,Rebuilding cars?,A lot of parts are not interchangeable.
786,Is asking an obese person if they go to the gym considered fat shaming?,"Are you doing it because they're fat or because you want their company at gym? If it's the former, it's fat shaming. Not your business, move on."
787,Can any men help me understand why my boyfriend does this?,"It's not a choice thing, if it's obvious sex is coming you get hard"
788,"Recovering alcoholics, when did you realize that you needed help?","Was working from home during COVID a few months into a new job. Was making dumb mistakes and getting chewed out for it. I was getting hammered every night and getting poor sleep, leading to making those dumb mistakes. Also, my sex drive tanked and I got fat due to developing low T. Swore off booze and never looked back."
789,If athesists dont believe in an after life why dont they just become heroin or alcohol addicts so they can achieve the most pleasure before they die?,not having an afterlife gives one more incentive not to die doing things like massive amounts of heroin
790,"The U.S. President has a private Presidential railroad car that is kept in the sub-basement of Grand Central Station. Has Pres.

837,"Why is nudity a thing that (in average society) requires ""consent"" from someone else witnessing it?","There are other ways to express confidence of your body without exposing unwilling participants to your nude body.

Think it this way, a person is able to express their sexuality, but others are well withing their rights to not want to have sex with them. Saying you don't want to have sex with somebody is not shaming them, it's you simply not wanting to have sex with them."
838,Why does schizophrenia not exist in other animals?,It might we wouldn’t know lol
839,Why do males take so long to poo?,"Not my personal style to do it in the bathroom after work, but I think I might see where he's coming from.

For me it was ""being caught in traffic"" when I really just relaxing under a tree in the park."
840,is what i’m doing enough?,"As a hetero-male, the best gifts I've received from women do not involve her spending money.

Just saying....."

842,Why do some people have allergy's to food while others don't?,"We don't really know. One theory is over-exposure. Another is what the mother is eating during pregnancy can help prevent allergies by exposing the body to the substance so the immune system doesn't over-react.

By the way you don't ""build"" an immunity to an allergen. Your body thinks an allergen is germs and over-reacts in a way that is harmful to you."
843,What Does Greening Out Feel Like?,"It was 20 years ago and the reason I really just avoid weed or any substance other than doctor prescribed…

A few friends and myself visited his girlfriend’s college.  It was an unfamiliar setting with unfamiliar people. It felt like I was falling off the side of Earth.  If I didn’t grab grass I felt like I would fall horizontal to the ground.

When inside it felt like when I’d walk or turn that I wasn’t walking or turning but the world it self was moving in relation to me and I was stationary.

Before I felt to sleep I was convinced Dave Matthew’s had put “angel dust” in it in spite of everyone else smoking it and having zero issues.  This claim was shouted by myself repeatedly to the residence of some dorm and at a later point I found myself screaming it in the quad like some Dragonborn from Skyrim.

I cried for my mom.  My girlfriend said I was embarrassing and broke up with me.  The Denys grand slam I had the next morning gave me diarrhea for days. My ass burnt the entire two hours back to my college. 

Fuck you SUNY Oneonta."
844,"Solo hiking/backpacking, is it really a good idea to lie/pretend that you're hiking with others when you meet people on a trail?","It's certainly something you can do as a precaution, but I've never felt the need.

845,Are the beans at chipotle served hot or cold (temperature)?,They’re definitely at least warm

853,Do hostage negotiators greet the hostage taker,The goal is to establish rapport so im sure they do.
854,I need help articulating why this is bad?,"Well, in all cases they are making unfounded assumptions in some way or another. 

For example, your socialist claims:

* premise A: humans are naturally social animals
* premise B: natural is good
* premise C: it defies nature for social animals to pursue individual aspirations
* Conclusion: A human is good if they prioritize communal service over individual aspirations. 

The premises, if true, fairly well lead to the socialist's conclusion. And premise A is probably true, I think most would agree. However, premises B and C are not really a given. They are very bold assumptions made by your socialist. In order for the conclusion to be cogent, the premises must first be proven to be true. 

At a certain point in their arguments, each of your examples makes an unfounded assumption as part of their logic. Question one of those assumptions and the argument breaks down. 

Um, who is your audience for articulating this? If they are one of these groups then good luck changing anyone's mind with logic."

858,How do sharks and other sea animals end up beached?,"Confusion, exhaustion and distress, if they've travelled for a long time without much food they can get disorientated and end up in a really bad way, thinking they could rest but get pulled in by the tides and their bodies give in to what is happening to them."
859,I'm having a hard time getting mail from my apartment complex and I'm wondering the legality of it.,"It's not withholding mail to only have certain hours. It's withholding if they never give it to you or make the hours way overly-restrictive, which it doesn't sound like they are."

862,Is it weird to cuddle with your friends?,Only on Reddit is it considered normal to cuddle with a friend of the opposite gender (assuming both heterosexual). Most people will consider that to be weird. Cuddling is a romantic activity and not a platonic one. It's usually done between couples.

869,Is it wrong to use online discussion boards as a means to understand real life situations?,"When you use it as *just one* of several different tools, it's a useful tool.

The problem is some people use it as a one stop shop. They'll base major life decisions on something one random asshole says."
870,"My girlfriend kinda looks crosseyed when we're looking into each others eyes up close and personal. But her eyes are perfectly straight in any other situation (if shes looking at me from a farther position, etc.) , is this normal for human eyes?","The closer a person’s gaze gets to the tip of her own nose, the more her eyes are going to cross. That’s how we’re able to focus. Your eyes are going to do it, too, if your faces are super close together."
871,I can’t think of original music (please help),"What I would do in your situation is to start out by copying parts of some of those songs, and then modifying them very many times. Keep modifying until it actually is something that you've created."
872,Why do girls hate or don't like men who are super nice?,"Your friend is an idiot. Being nice is not the problem here.

875,"Why do drugs and ""crime"" seemingly fall into my lap?","> I also tend to go with the flow of life
