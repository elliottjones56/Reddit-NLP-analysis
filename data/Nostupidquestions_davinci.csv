0,"If Germany calls itself Deutschland, why don't we call it that? Same for all other countries, why not pronounce their native names?","It’s called “*exonyms*”.

Germany is a tricky one, because it was the name that the Roman Empire gave to that area. But the very people didn’t call themselves that.

However, remote places kept the reference to the Roman name. And adding that until 250 years ago the fastest way you could travel was on a horse, people stuck with a lot of exonyms, letting them be cemented into language long before we had more direct communication.","

It is a matter of familiarity. For most people living outside of Germany, it is easier and more comfortable to use the English equivalent of the country's name, rather than its native name. Furthermore, cultural and language barriers can make it more difficult to accurately pronounce a name in its native language. Many people could also feel uncomfortable using a foreign language for something as simple as naming a country. It is simply a matter of ease and preference."
1,"Why do all girls seem to find other girls attractive, even though they’re not bi/lesbian?",noticing beauty is different than having sexual attraction,"

This is likely because people are generally drawn to people who are similar to them in some way, and as such, they often find traits in other people similar to the traits they possess themselves attractive. Additionally, humans have an innate appreciation of beauty, regardless of whether they are attracted to the same gender, which can explain why even those who are not bi/lesbian can find other girls attractive."
2,Is it reasonable to not want to marry someone who can’t provide?,"Hi /u/throwaway29383p,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

Yes, it is reasonable to not want to marry someone who cannot provide. People usually marry for a variety of reasons including financial stability and security. As such, not wanting to marry someone who cannot provide is a valid and understandable decision."
3,what’s the most offensive thing you’ve ever seen sold and were there any repercussions?,"This isn't super offensive like some suggestions I've seen, but shortly after Star Wars Episode 1 came out is saw some disturbing merch: a JarJar Binks candy sucker. It had a plastic JarJar head and you would push a plunger to make the head split open wide at the mouth and, apparently, suck on the tongue-shaped candy.

6th grade me thought: ""What the *actual* fuck?""

There was indeed some outrage, that item wasn't sold long but it wasn't a newsworthy scandal.","

The most offensive thing I have ever seen sold was a T-shirt that had a racial slur on it. The repercussions were that the store immediately removed the shirt from their shelves and apologized for having it in the first place."
4,If WWIII kicks off would nuclear missiles be shot down over water (given enough time) and/or would nukes be dropped as bombs like WWII?,ICBMs fly into space.  No pilot is going to shoot them down.,"

It is possible that, given enough time, nuclear missiles could be shot down before they reach their intended targets. This is because, as with other types of missiles, they can be detected and intercepted, either by enemy air defenses or by anti-missile defense systems. If such an interception should occur, then the warhead could be destroyed without detonating or a dud might result, depending on the type of missile used. 

Just like during WWII, it is also possible that nukes could be dropped as bombs. In a nuclear war, an aggressor might want to engage in nuclear bombing or, at the very least, threaten to do so. This could be done with precision aircraft, cruise missiles, bombers, or manually delivered weapons, some of which are air-street, or air-to-surface."
5,Explain like I’m 5… how do I shower correctly,"You may need some clinical antiperspirant.  That isn't unusual.

Speak to your Dr.","

Showering correctly is pretty easy! First, you should start by turning on your water. You want the water to be warm when you step in, so you'll want to adjust the temperature and make sure it's a comfortable temperature. Next, you'll want to use soap, shampoo, and any other body wash products you like to use. Work them into a lather and then apply them to your body, making sure to wash your hair, face, and body. Be sure to rinse your body off really well after you've applied the products and scrubbed your body. Finally, turn off the water when you're done and pat your body dry with a towel. That's it - now you've showered correctly!"
6,My orthodontist always calls me a good girl is this weird?,"Orthodontist? Is this while getting braces tightened? He may just be used to younger kids moaning bc it hurts 

I am a very hard needle stick, the number of times I've been told 'good girl' and been patted throughout my life after an especially hard time I can't count. 


Sometimes it's someone trying to show empathy or encouragement.

Just speak to him about it. If it continues beyond that,  file a complaint.","

No, it is not weird for an orthodontist to call you a good girl. It could be a sign of appreciation or simply a gesture of kindness. However, if it makes you uncomfortable, then you should talk to your orthodontist about it."
7,What exactly am I supposed to be looking at when watching women belly dancing or other forms of erotic dances?,Look at everything at once or any specific thing. Whatever you like. You're supposed to be staring.,"

When watching an erotic dance, you should observe the performer's body movements, facial expressions, and gestures as they interact with their environment and the audience. Pay attention to how the dancer uses the different parts of the body to create seductive and suggestive motions. Additionally, look for the dancer's confidence in the movement, the manner in which they command the space around them, and the energy emanating from the performance as a composition."
8,What happens to the foreskin during sex?,">does the foreskin go in or bunch up at the base

As a man, reading this was very painful.

no, the foreskin retracts to show the glans, but it doesn't go any further, so it remains around the neck of the glans, and yes it does go in.","

During sex, the foreskin may be pulled back and the head of the penis may be exposed. Depending on the couple, the foreskin may remain pulled back throughout the duration of sexual intercourse, or the foreskin may slide over the head of the penis during thrusts. Every couple can decide how they would like to incorporate the foreskin into sex. "
9,Why is it close to impossible for a new Reddit account to participate on this platform?,Just browse a while. I have a month and have 7oo points. Just installed for a legal  question but there are some interesting subs. By the way is there an index or something with a description of the subreddits? Each day I learn about an interesting sub but I would like to have an index or something.,"

New Reddit accounts have restrictions in place to prevent spam. These restrictions include a minimum number of comment karma points and a minimum account age before a new account can participate in certain activities. As such, it is close to impossible for a new Reddit account to participate on this platform without putting in a lot of work to build up their karma points and wait for their account to become old enough to participate."
10,Why the fuck is cling wrap smaller than a a standard dinner plate?,"So you have to use another piece or two to cover it completely, using more wrap making you buy another roll sooner.","

Cling wrap is a thin and lightweight material that is designed to be used in food containers and to cover items for storage. The size of a standard dinner plate is usually much larger than the size of the cling wrap when it is given in its standard packaging size because the wrap needs to be large enough to be used to cover different shapes and sizes of items."
11,Is it ok to fantasize about ex gf after a toxic breakup?,I don’t think it’s “not ok” it’s just fantasizing. My ex was posting the same stuff,"

It depends on how you fantasize about them. Fantasizing can be a way to cope with the break up or to reminisce about the good parts of your relationship. However, if the fantasizing becomes obsessive or damaging in any way, it may be a sign you should seek help."
12,"As a male employee who cleans the women’s restroom, what’s the least awkward way to make sure it’s empty before I enter?","Knock on the door and say ""Cleaning guy coming through! Anyone in there?""","

The best way to make sure the restroom is empty before entering is to knock on the door, wait for an answer, and then announce that you are the custodian there to clean the restroom and ask if anyone is inside. If no one answers, it is likely the restroom is empty."
13,Is it weird to hit on a bartender?,"Just remember that the bartender is at her JOB and is trapped there, while you're on your free time. Give her the option/ability to contact you one day if she's interested, but respect her workspace.","

It depends. If the bartender is comfortable having conversations with guests, then it's probably not weird. If the bartender is obviously too busy or isn't interested, then it would be inappropriate and weird."
14,How do I remove the poop smell from a bathroom immediately?,Everybody poops. Nobody will think you're a weirdo for pooping.,"

1. Put a few drops of essential oil in a bowl of water and microwave it for several minutes on high.

2. Use a natural enzymatic cleaner like Bio-Kleen to break down the odor.

3. Place a bowl of white vinegar in the bathroom and let it sit overnight.

4. Sprinkle baking soda in the toilet bowl, scrub, and flush.

5. Soak cotton balls in rubbing alcohol and set around the bathroom.

6. Place a few bowls of activated charcoal around the bathroom.

7. Take the fan off the wall and clean it with a mixture of vinegar and water."
15,Why do people seem to love to Florida so much?,It's supposed to be hot. Most people go down there to wear sandals and take clothes off.,"

People love to visit Florida due to its year-round warm weather, beautiful beaches, and various attractions like Disney World and Universal Studios. Additionally, it has a large selection of restaurants, shopping, and cultural activities. People easily can access it too by air or car and its numerous airports and ports make transportation convenient. Finally, it is within a reasonable driving distance for many in the East Coast and Midwest of the United States."
16,Is it embarrassing to order one meal for two people in a restaurant?,waiters always give me judgmental looks when I order two meals for one person.   but I don't care.,"

It's not necessarily embarrassing to order one meal for two people in a restaurant, though it may depend on the context. For instance, if it's a romantic dinner, it may be a bit unusual to share one meal. However, some restaurants and cuisines (like tapas) actively promote sharing of dishes. Therefore, it is best to consider the restaurant and the food being ordered before making a decision."
17,Can someone who's practicing Hinduism eat beef if they're starving?,"I’m Hindu. 

Short answer is yes you can eat beef in such a situation. There is a concept we practice called ahimsa which means “non violence”. Ahimsa is where the idea of vegetarianism comes from in our faith. 

However “violence” is allowed in situations of self defense etc. that is the exact moral dilemma Arjun faces in the Bhagavad Geetha. Arjuna was an ancient king who was faced with the moral dilemma of killing his own evil brothers. The Bhagavad Geetha is a conversation between God (Krishna) and king Arjun about this moral dilemma. Basically God tells Arjun he must follow his Dharma and sometimes commit violence to prevent harm to others. 

Eating beef to survive is similar to self defense. 

There’s a good section on non-human life here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa","

Most Hindus are vegetarian and consider a cow to be a sacred animal, so it is highly unlikely that they would eat beef out of desperation. It is considered forbidden to eat beef, and those who do are considered to have broken a sacred oath."

19,"How many guys out there make an effort to make a woman cum first? Or just if it happens it happens, it's up to her?",The sex after a woman cums is way better and way wetter,"

There is no single answer to this question as everyone has different desires and preferences. Ultimately, it is up to both partners to decide what works best for them. Some people may make an effort to make a woman cum first, while others may focus more on making sure that both parties have an enjoyable experience that leads to mutual satisfaction."

21,When did pitbulls become so evil? When I was growing up it was rottweilers that were the most terrifying dog. What happened?,"Past 5 years? They've been banned in the UK since 1991, this isn't a sudden new thing.","

There is no scientific evidence to suggest that pitbulls (or any breed of dog for that matter) are inherently evil. Breeds of dogs, like breed prejudice that can exist in humans, is often a result of a society’s tendency to choose a victim, and prejudices and associated features are assigned to them.

In the case of pitbulls, this began in the 1980s when the media sensationalized and demonized the breed after a string of attacks and news articles depicting pitbulls as vicious and wild animals. This led to a strong public opinion that pitbulls were dangerous animals and created the idea in people’s minds that all members of this breed are wild and dangerous.

Although pitbulls were not always demonized, fear and stigma associated with many breeds of dog have been around for a long time. Rottweilers are a prime example of this with incidents of aggression that eventually seen the breed deemed dangerous.

The takeaway is that the backgrounds and experiences of individual dogs, not their breed, should determine their character and behavior. All dogs can be dangerous and aggressive if improperly trained and socialized. Responsible owners should always prioritize training, socialization, proper health and nutrition, and exercise for their dogs regardless of breed."
22,What is a soy boy?,they are basically calling you a wimp or pussy.,"

A soy boy is a slang term used to describe a male who is seen as weak or lacking in traditionally masculine qualities such as physical strength, emotional fortitude, financial responsibility, and independence. The implication is that these people are overly sensitive and have been 'feminized' by their diet of soy products."
23,How do americans afford uber?,"We don’t use Uber as an everyday thing, just special occasions where you really need it.","

Americans typically pay for Uber rides using debit or credit cards. Users can link a debit or credit card to their account, or pay with cash in select cities. Additionally, some employers may choose to reimburse employees for Uber rides and other business-related expenses."
24,Why is society designed for only morning people and not night owls?,And as a night owl that’s the way I like it. I love having the night to myself,"

Society is designed for morning people because the default schedule for businesses, jobs, school and other activities typically revolves around a 9 to 5 model which is traditionally designed to accommodate the majority of the population who are morning people. This is primarily a consequence of traditional labor practices rather than any inherent bias against night owls.

That said, night owls face unique challenges that many employers may not be aware of. Being a productive night owl in a morning-focused world often involves managing both discrimination and exhaustion. Even though there is increasing awareness and understanding of the benefits that different sleeping patterns can bring to productivity and wellbeing, there is still a significant amount of stigma attached to being a night owl, and that can make it difficult for employers to provide flexi-time or other arrangements to accommodate these alternative sleeping patterns."
25,"If Justin Bieber hates the fame so much, why does he keep performing?",He signed contracts. He can't stop now,"

Justin Bieber has said that he's grown to appreciate the fame over time, and that although he might find it overwhelming at times, it's something he loves because it has helped him achieve a lot of his dreams. He likely keeps performing because he still enjoys creating and performing music and it gives him a way to connect with his fanbase."
26,Has anyone else just accepted that retirement is just not a possibility?,I'm pretty sure I will have to work a half day on the day of my funeral.,"

Yes, many people have accepted that retirement is not a possibility. Many people are unable to save enough money or have inadequate pension plans, leaving them no choice but to work for the rest of their lives. That's why it is so important to ensure that you have the financial means to retire and not have to rely solely on Social Security."
27,"Why do people put the ""In memory of"" stickers on their cars?",Where I live the stickers are sold to friends and family and the proceeds are used toward the funeral costs because the deceased person is young and the family didn't have any plans in place for burial.,"

People might put an ""In Memory Of"" sticker on their car if they have experienced the loss of a loved one. The sticker can be a way for them to remember and honor the person who passed away. It can also serve as a way to remind them of how precious life is and to be present in the moment."
28,Sober People - What do you order at the bar?,Soda water and lime was always my go-to.  I actually like the way it tastes and I find it very thirst quenching.  I never saw anyone roll their eyes or heard any comments about it.,"

That depends on the bar, as each bar has its own menu, but generally a non-alcoholic beverage such as a soda, juice, iced tea, or water is a safe choice."
29,How can I get over small penis anxiety,"Some girls care, some don't. Keep putting yourself out there till you find someone who is compatible with you.","?

1. Seek treatment from a mental health professional. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) with a licensed therapist can help you understand your thoughts and behaviors and how they relate to your penis anxiety. 

2. Engage in self-care. Make sure you are taking time for yourself to do activities that bring you joy and build your self-confidence. This could include physical activity, spending time with friends, journaling, or reading. 

3. Challenge negative thoughts. It is important to remember that everyone is different and that there is no one “right” size for a penis. When you find yourself engaging in negative self-talk, try replacing it with positive affirmations or realistic statements. 

4. Spend time with trusted people. Spend time with people who make you feel accepted and seen for who you are, not just your body. 

5. Educate yourself. There is a lot of inaccurate and even false information out there about penis sizes. Learn the facts so that you can better understand yourself and the diversity of bodies."
30,"If humans and chimpanzees share 99% of their DNA with one another, then why do human siblings share only 50%? What's going on here?","Hi /u/johnnysLeftShoes,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub.

Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

The 99% of shared DNA between humans and chimpanzees is an estimate based on research of the overall genetic similarity between the two species. On the other hand, the 50% of shared DNA between two human siblings comes from the way that parental chromosomes recombine to form the full set of chromosomes for an offspring. For example, out of the two chromosomes from a parent, the new offspring might get one full chromosome of each type, and those two chromosomes will be different from the original two sets of chromosomes from the parents. Therefore, two siblings will never share the exact same set of chromosomes, only about 50% of the genes."
31,"Why do people say ""Quote Un-Quote"" and THEN say the thing that is the quote?",It's supposed to be used when you're only quoting one word,"

The phrase ""quote unquote"" is used to indicate that the speaker is quoting someone else or another source for emphasis. It is also used when quoting a phrase that may be considered clichéd or overused. By saying ""quote unquote"" before the quoted phrase, the speaker is distancing themselves from it and indicating that they do not necessarily endorse it."
32,Why don’t households have water fountains?,What does  a water fountain do that can't be accomplished with a sink?,"

The majority of households today have access to running water, making the installation of a water fountain unnecessary. Additionally, water fountains typically require regular maintenance which is also impractical in a home setting. Furthermore, water fountains could be large, obtrusive, and require additional plumbing."
33,What to when someone owes you money but won’t pay you?,"Let him know that you are really needing that money back ASAP. If it does not happen within the next week, then yes I would cut him off, especially if you already had reasons to do it anyway. Money should not make or break friendships but with all my friends they have paid me back exactly when they told me they would after borrowing money, so I personally have not had this problem before.","

1. Ask the person to pay the debt or set up a repayment plan.
2. Send a demand letter.
3. Take them to small claims court.
4. Hire a collection agency.
5. File a lien against their property.
6. Report them to the credit bureaus.
7. Seek legal advice or explore alternative methods of dispute resolution such as arbitration or mediation."
34,how can i kindly say i don't wanna have sex with someone after we already took off some/all of our clothes?,"It's impossible to clearly communicate this boundary without hurting their feelings. Just be honest and deal with the fallout. 

To avoid this, I personally try not to have sex the very first time we see each other naked, more work your way up to that with a ""second base"" date so you can see what you're working with before getting to that point","

You can say something like ""I don't think I'm ready for this right now"" or ""I'm not comfortable with taking this any further right now."""
35,"How did the song ""Makeba"" by Jain become Instafamous suddenly?","""Makeba"" by Jain is surging in popularity thanks to a TikTok trend featuring Bill Hader. 

https://www.insider.com/how-miriam-makeba-inspired-viral-tiktok-meme-dance-2023-7

The same way the 80s song Running Up That Hill by Kate Bush was shot back to the top of the charts after it was used in one scene of Stranger Things.","

The song ""Makeba"" by Jain became Instafamous when it was featured on the soundtrack for a Joyner Lucas and Will Smith music video entitled ""Ain't No Ryme"". The video was posted on YouTube and featured the song in three different scenes, garnering millions of views in its first week of release. Jain's song received coverage on various entertainment and music websites, as well as socials, which helped to spread the word about the single. Additionally, the video was shared on multiple prominent international music blogs and streaming playlists, which also helped to boost its popularity. Finally, online radio and radio stations worldwide also played the song, ultimately leading to it becoming Instafamous."
36,Is everyone getting spammed with dm's from onlyfans chicks?,Yep. Not every day though,"

No, not everyone is getting spammed with DM's from OnlyFans chicks. Thankfully, there are many ways to stop such contacts, such as blocking them or changing your settings."
37,Are there ways a man can masturbate to completion without stroking his dick?,Massage your prostate.,"

Yes, there are several ways to masturbate without stroking your penis. Many men enjoy stimulating the head of their penis with their other hand, or using a vibrator placed against the head of the penis. Some men also enjoy the sensation of grinding against a pillow or other flat surface. Finally, indirect stimulation (stimulating in and around the genitals without touching the penis directly) can be pleasurable and lead to climax."
38,Why do girls comment on other girls’ posts so much?,">guys don’t seem to validate each other

Ever notice all the lonely men with no close human connections?","

Girls comment on other girls’ posts for a variety of reasons. It could be to show support, give advice, or just to connect and stay in touch. Social media gives girls the ability to bond and share experiences with one another, which can be helpful when it comes to dealing with emotional difficulties or social issues. Girls may also use social media as a form of expression, and commenting on posts can be an outlet for that."
39,going long periods of time without verbally taking. Have you ever done that? for how long? is it a bad thing?,"Are you having trouble with other things like sleeping/bathing/eating? In other words, are you depressed? Self-isolation is a very common symptom of clinical depression. What’s the rest of your life like?","

Yes, I have done that at times. The longest time I have gone without verbally talking was around 5 days. I would say it can be a bad thing if it is done often, because it can be a sign of depression and it can make it harder to communicate with others."
40,Why does Reddit have so many troll posts even though this site is anonymous?,"two reasons come to mind. one, it's entertainment, for the reader or the writer. two, the writer has an agenda they want to push, and the story (in theory) advances that agenda in people's mind if it is believed. the ""down with cis bus"" story comes to mind although that's not from this site.","

Reddit has a culture that has become increasingly tolerant of trolling, and while it strives to be an open and inclusive community, it can often be a hotbed for trolling. Many trolls feel emboldened by the anonymity afforded to them on Reddit, as it provides a means of expression behind an assumed identity, and many have found ways to exploit its platform for their own personal gain. Additionally, some users may be unaware of the long-term consequences of their actions on Reddit, as the site is not heavily policed or moderated, allowing trolls to propagate their insensitive or otherwise offensive content without fear of retribution."
41,Why do people on the internet say that people with large age gaps “have nothing in common?”,"Yeah I think you're misinterpreting it. It's not about having common interests, it's about the stage of life you're in. You can be friends at pretty much any age, especially adults. Relationships though, building a life with someone requires you to be on the same ground mentally. A 28 year old is in a significantly different place in their life than an 18 year old, but a 45 year old is more likely to be in a similar place as a 55 year old.","

People on the internet may say that people with large age gaps have nothing in common because, typically, couples who have large age gaps have different backgrounds, interests, goals, and life experiences. Generally, couples with smaller age gaps may have more in common since they may have grown up in a similar environment and have more similar life experiences and interests."
42,Am I crazy or do I have zero self respect?,"No. You're just human and you made some mistakes. More than that, you're dealing with an emotional abuser, they twist and distort things and I have no doubt that he did that to you as well.

It's not your fault, at the end of the day, he did what he did. He knew it, and did it anyway. 

 You should however, consider getting help both for your addictions and your mental health. People like him love to exploit people that have vulnerabilities. That's the sort of people abusers target, because they love to control.","

No, you are not crazy, and everyone experiences times of low self-esteem. Having feelings of low self-respect can be normal. What matters is how you respond to those feelings. It is important to practice self-care andSelf Compassion as an important part of building up your self-esteem. Find something that recharges you, like reading, art, or music, and practice self-compassion with yourself. Don’t forget to be gentle with yourself and surround yourself with positive people."
43,Is it weird that I don't like and don't identify with my culture?,I’m more a citizen of the internet than my country. I don’t think it’s weird I think it’s just your lifestyle,"

No, it is not weird. Although it would be strange if you had never been exposed to your culture, many people feel disconnected from their culture or the culture they were raised in for various reasons and that is perfectly normal. You may not identify with the culture's traditions or language, or maybe you don't feel like your experiences line up with what is deemed 'normal' in the culture. Whatever the reason, it's perfectly natural to want something more or something different than what you've been exposed to."
44,What do people mean by you're born alone and you die alone?,"I always understood it in a slightly less literal sense. You might be surrounded by people, friends, family, you may belong to a close community, but ultimately there is a limit, to which one can know and understand the other. In that sense each individual is alone in the entirety of their being and their experiences. You are born alone as an individual and you die alone as an individual.","

The phrase ""you're born alone and you die alone"" is often used to emphasize the idea that a person can only rely on themselves for strength and comfort throughout life. It conveys the idea that no matter how much loved ones may offer their support and assistance, ultimately an individual must face life's challenges and struggles alone."
45,is Gen z screwed?,"You shouldn’t want to buy a house at 18. That’s insanity. Stick with the parents or get some roommates and learn how that chaos works. 

I’m going to assume you’re American (as am I) and you’re conditioned to achieve all these things that define you’re success. They’re bullshit. The American dream isn’t real. It’s a way to force you into a life of consumerism and be the good little cow they can milk for money while you eat out of your feed bag. 

Stay at home if home life isn’t bad. Get through college or technical school. Save up money at a minimum.

Do you know how many Europeans stay living at home until they’re almost 30? Even in super serious relationships. They save up a ton of cash and then move out when they can put a huge sum down on a house or apartment and finally break off to start their lives together.","

No. Gen Z has many opportunities to be successful. With increasing access to technology, a growing number of career options, and an understanding of the importance of being well-rounded, Gen Z can fulfill their potential."
46,Do chocolates made by a professional confectioner differ from mass produced ones like Snickers?,"Yes, they taste better","

Yes, chocolates made by a professional confectioner are generally of a higher quality than mass-produced chocolates like Snickers.

47,Is it possible for an extrovert to become an introvert?,Social anxiety perhaps? I was a huge extrovert up til about high school when I got randomly bombarded with anxiety and became more & more of an introvert. Maybe going into elementary was scary for kid you,"

Yes, it is possible for an extrovert to become an introvert. This typically happens when an individual has experienced a traumatic event or long-term stress, which significantly changes the way they interact with others. It is important to note that it is not a simple process and, in some cases, can take a long time to achieve."
48,Do you see yourself getting old?,"I'm 53.

I have been seeing myself ""get old"" since 27.","

Yes, I do see myself getting old, just like everyone else. Although it is hard to picture it sometimes, I know that it will eventually come to pass."
49,Are you actually inconvenienced by the actor/writer strike?,Forgot about it 5 minutes after it started.,"

No, I am not directly inconvenienced by the actor/writer strike."
50,Why do some people like eating ass?,Because it makes their/our partner feel good.,"

Eating ass can be a pleasurable experience due to the sensitivity of the area, which can be activated with the help of tongue and lips. It is also an intimate act, which can be enjoyable for partners to explore."
51,Why is men’s fashion so boring?,"It's not, it's just associated with homosexuality. What you understand to be men's fashion is just a bunch of dudes terrified of being called gay.","

Men's fashion can seem boring because men's styles often stay within a certain traditional range and don't change drastically from season to season. Additionally, the fashion industry overall has experienced a more saturated market, so not as much experimentation is happening or as many distinct trends are emerging as in previous years."
52,Is it true on OnlyFans when I message a girl it’s mostly a dude that manages multiple women’s accounts?,"I know a few content girls with managers, however the managers don't answer the inbox messages. But, I also know a few girls who have their boyfriends respond to the inbox messages. Most of them answer their own messages.","

It depends on the profile you are messaging. Some accounts are managed by multiple people, including men, and some accounts are managed solely by the individual performing. Ultimately, the best way to find out is by messaging the person directly and asking them."
53,"Why is the URL for ""X"" still twitter.com and not x.com or something like that?",A rebranding like that takes a lot of planning and effort.,"

Twitter's URL has always been twitter.com to maintain brand recognition and to remain consistent. Additionally, it can be much more expensive to purchase a custom domain such as x.com. Twitter's consistent URL has helped it become one of the most recognizable brands on the internet."
54,Why are you religious?,"I was born Orthodox Christian, became atheist, and then returned to Christianity when I had a moment of ""feeling"" faith for the first time in recogniseable way.

These days I live very much in religous way, and it benefits my life and people around me.","

I'm religious because believing in something bigger than myself brings me joy and fulfillment. It gives me an orientation throughout life and gives me comfort in times of difficulty. I believe in the power of faith and the power of good deeds. I'm religious because it gives me a sense of purpose and belonging."
55,"Clowns are supposed to be funny, since when clowns became creepy and scary ?","Always? The clown look hasn't changed that much over the years, and I'm just as creeped out by pictures of old clowns as I am of pictures of modern clowns.","

The origin of clowns being seen as creepy and scary likely began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when films such as IT and Killer Klowns From Outer Space featured disconcerting images of clowns. These movies, along with those that followed, have helped to create a horror trope where clowns are typically depicted as being sinister and threatening. In recent years, reports of so-called ""creepy clowns"" appearing in public places has further propagated the idea of clowns being sinister, and it has become a common trope in films and other forms of media."
56,"If someone wants to fall asleep and they close their eyes, why can’t they fall asleep?",Their mind is running. They're restless. They don't feel good. Theyre stressed.,"

Falling asleep is not as simple as closing your eyes. It's a complex process and can be impacted by a variety of factors such as stress, anxiety, physical comfort, diet, lifestyle, and environment. Generally speaking, relaxation is key to falling asleep, so finding ways to relax the body and mind can help facilitate the process. Additionally, establishing a consistent bedtime and wake time, avoiding late-night eating, avoiding stimulating activities before bed, and creating a comfortable and calming sleep environment can help create a conducive sleeping environment."
57,who was the person first decided that boys color is blue and girls is pink?,"Athanase Garnier, 1823 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_historical_sources_for_pink_and_blue_as_gender_signifiers","

It is unclear who first decided that boys should wear blue and girls should wear pink; however, this traditional color coding began in the United States in the 19th century when a clothing retailer called Febiger’s decided it would be best to use gender-specific color coding in its catalogs. It is possible, however, that the gender-specific color coding dates back even further."
58,Why do scammers love Whatsapp?,"WhatsApp has about 2.7 Billion active users. 

SnapChat has  750 Million. 

Facebook Messenger has about 150 Million. 

If you wanted to run a scam where only 0.01% of the messages result in a successful scam, which platform would you pick?","

Scammers love WhatsApp because it is a popular messaging platform with over two billion users worldwide. It is free to use and has a large user base, making it a very attractive platform for scammers to target. Additionally, WhatsApp offers a mobile app that allows users to communicate while on the go. This makes it easier for scammers to target potential victims since they do not necessarily have to be in the same geographic area."
59,Does anyone else get a random horrific thought and have to physically shake their body to stop thinking about it?,"Sure, for me thought OCD + tic/tourette kind of thing

Professional help would probably help with that","

Yes, it can be a normal reaction to try to shake off a particular thought or an intense feeling. It can be a way of releasing some of that energy and can even be helpful in regulating difficult emotions. If it's something that you find yourself doing often, it might be worth talking to a therapist to explore the source of the thought or feeling as well as how to best manage it."
60,Why is a marriage proposal usually a surprise and not a discussion?,"It's not, or at least it shouldn't be.  The *timing* of a proposal can be a surprise, but the actual proposal itself should be the culmination of the relationship and shouldn't be a surprise.","

A marriage proposal is usually a surprise because it is a significant and emotional moment that is meant to be a surprise to make the moment special. It is often not a discussion because it is more of a surprise, rather than a matter of negotiation."
61,Is it possible to have asthma without ever having an asthma attack?,Yes. Asthma bronchiale is a chronic inflammation of the airways of the lungs. Mild forms can go for years or indeed indefinitely without an attack. But rarely without any symptoms at all.,"

Yes, it is possible to have asthma without ever having an asthma attack. Some people with asthma experience mild symptoms which are easily managed and they may never have an asthma attack. Without proper medical diagnosis and treatment, some people may be living with undiagnosed asthma and can go for years without experiencing an asthma attack."
62,How often do you think about sex?,Daily.,"

Answer: Everyone has individual preferences, so the frequency with which people think about sex varies. Some people might think about sex multiple times a day, while others may only think about it occasionally."
63,Is there a left handed way to fold sheets?,"Same family situation. Mom was a lefty, I'm almost ambidextrous due to switching hands so often. Are you talking about fitted sheets? Because I cant imagine that a flat, square, top sheet would be no different no matter how its folded.

Edit: you should have told your girlfriend to flip it over and turn it around and then it would be the right way.","

Yes, it is possible to left handedly fold sheets. Start by folding the sheet in half, and turning the sheet 180 degrees so the folded side is pointing towards your left hand. Then, tuck the left side over with your left hand, and fold the right side over with your right hand. Firmly press down each fold with your hands until it stays crisp and even."
64,Did the US military establish no fly zones prior to 9/11?,"Yes. I used to fly to Vegas as a kid from Calgary, and it was a longer flight than it should have been because there was some sort of air base in the middle that the commercial planes couldn’t fly over","

No, the US military did not establish no fly zones prior to 9/11. There were some agreements made between the United Nations and Iraq regarding the monitoring of air and sea traffic in the region, but these agreements were not enforced by the US military."
65,"What to expect when dating a 66 year old, beautiful woman?","Unless you can find a redditor who has dated this specific woman, you're not going to get any useful answers here.

You're dating an individual, not an age group. You behave the way you would behave on any date.","

Expect casual conversations, respect, and companionship. As a 66-year-old, beautiful woman, her life experience and wisdom will likely make her an interesting and engaging date. She may have preferences about how she likes to spend time on a date, and it’s best to get to know her and find out what those are. Make sure to give her your undivided attention and be respectful of her wishes. Some topics that she may find interesting for conversation include family, travel, current events, and hobbies. Be open to learning about her experiences and be prepared to share your own."
66,Why is the British Empire demonized but the Roman Empire (among others) romanticized?,Of course we gotta romanticize the Romans. I mean the word romantic literally comes from them,"

The way the British Empire is viewed today is complicated and largely shaped by historical events and attitudes. On the one hand, the British Empire is associated with oppressive colonization and exploitation of foreign lands. On the other hand, the British Empire is also remembered for its introduction of democracy, rule of law, and other principles of western modernity that many countries view positively. 

In contrast, the Roman Empire is often remembered as a romantic period in history that is associated with grandeur and power. The Romans are credited with many influential architectural, engineering, and social achievements. Additionally, there is often a greater sense of distance and detachment from the Roman Empire than from the British Empire, as it was so long ago. This detachment provides more room for romanticization and admiration."
67,Can you get a DUI if you're mowing your grass drunk?,"Where I am, the rule is if the device has internal motive effort. I.e., if it is a self-propelled or riding mower, you can get a DUI. However, you wouldn't for a purely mechanical push-mower. That being said, I'm sure the rules differ by location.

That being said, never operate machinery while intoxicated. You might not lose your freedom, but you could still lose your foot.","

No, a DUI typically requires operating a motor vehicle. Mowing a lawn requires the use of a non-motorized vehicle - typically a push mower - so it is not considered operating a motor vehicle."
68,How much time should pass between asking someone out and the date itself?,"It should be sometime within a week. Probably on Friday or the weekend, but if it's something more casual you might go out after work or school.","

This depends on the individual situation. If both people are available and excited to plan a date, then two days to one week is usually the optimal amount of time that should pass. If either person is busy, it could take longer."
69,How much cocaine do you think Ric Flair did in his prime wwe career?,ALL of it,"

It's impossible to know for sure how much cocaine Ric Flair may have taken during his WWE career. Flair has publicly stated that he had a problem with drugs and alcohol in the past, but he has also denied any use of cocaine. If Ric Flair did, in fact, use cocaine during his WWE career, it would have been a very small amount, likely limited to social use."
70,Who ruined vampire lore?,"Bram Stoker's *Dracula* has its own strong sexual themes, but it is more restrained about expressing them. That was the norm for the era it was published in (1897 Victorian England).","

It is difficult to point to one specific person who ""ruined"" vampire lore. Over the years, it has been subject to various interpretations and reinterpretations in the media, and what may be considered a terrible portrayal to one person may be beloved to another. Some individuals have popularized characters and stories that have widely become associated with vampires, such as novelist Bram Stoker and his novel Dracula, and film director Francis Ford Coppola and his 1992 adaptation of the same."
71,Why is (pig)-let only used for some words?,There is very little in the English language that is consistent and makes sense in all cases,"

Pig-let is a form of apocopation, which is the process of shortening a word by removing a letter or sound at the end. It is usually used when the word is excessive in syllables or its meaning is clear without the full word. Pig-let is most often used with longer words, such as ""don't"" becoming ""don't-let,"" ""dontcha"" becoming ""dontch-let,"" or ""can't"" becoming ""cant-let."""
72,Why do you hardly see the spouses of celebrities take their last names?,"Celebrities' names are their brand.  Changing it affects their brand. It happens, but not frequently.  Courtney Cox added ""Arquette"".","

There is no definitive answer for this question, but some possible reasons may include that it may be too much of a hassle to go through the legal process of changing one's official name or that the spouse may not want to lose the identity they had before marriage (or that was given by their parents). Additionally, for celebrities, it may be a way to maintain a degree of individual privacy or to distinguish themselves from their partner."
73,"When you were younger, what were some expectations you had about adulthood that ultimately went unfulfilled?",Being able to become anything I wanted,"

1. I expected to have more disposable income.
2. I expected to have more freedom and autonomy in my career choices and decisions.
3. I expected to be able to move out and live independently.
4. I expected to be able to travel and experience the world more.
5. I expected to own a nice home."
74,Anyone else struggle with personality tests?,Stop trying to think and just answer in 2 seconds.   You don't get to determine the outcome in life by gaming the challenges.,"

Many people struggle with personality tests. It is important to remember that most tests have flaws and may not accurately represent one's true personality. It is important to be honest and open when answering questions, but to also take personal biases into account. Personality tests can be helpful for understanding oneself, but they should not be taken too seriously."
75,Why is it considered bad practice to make tea in the microwave?,It doesn't.  Some people just like doing things a certain way.,"

It is considered bad practice to make tea in the microwave because microwave ovens can’t reach the desired temperature required for brewing tea. The boiling point of water is 212°F (100°C), whereas the temperature of water in a microwave is usually much lower. This means that the tea will not steep properly, resulting in a weak and unsatisfactory cup of tea. Furthermore, microwaving tea can also affect the taste and flavor of the tea since it reduces the essential oils and flavors."
76,Would you install a tracking app (location) on your phone if your partner wants to check on you? Would you want to want to track them?,No and no.,"

That depends on the circumstances and the nature of the relationship between myself and my partner. If my partner is trying to control me or make me feel like I need to answer to them, then it is not okay for them to want to install a tracking app and it is certainly not okay for me to want to track them. However, if our relationship has developed to a point where trust is mutual and we both want to feel a greater level of closeness, then tracking each other's locations might be something we would mutually agree to."
77,Why do you need to be 21 in America to buy an alcohol drink but no other products containing alcohol,"Most things like that will get you sick before they get you drunk.

If you try to drink enough mouthwash to get drunk as a normal person you're going to have a very bad time.","

In the United States, the legal drinking age is 21 because of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984. This act was established in reaction to the increase of drunk driving fatalities that occurred during the 1970s. By setting a legal drinking age of 21, the government hopes to reduce incidents of drunk driving and related fatalities by making it more difficult for young people to purchase alcohol."
78,What is the reasoning behind the removal of awards on Reddit?,"They didn't think it carried its weight, and the added visual and cognitive clutter didn't weigh up against the fun and income it brought.","

The reasoning behind the removal of awards on Reddit is to simplify the user experience and reduce the amount of clutter on the platform. Awards can create a sense of competition and, ultimately, could potentially create animosity between users, which is not conducive to creating a positive community. Removing awards makes Reddit less competitive and helps create a more collaborative environment."
79,What can I do to shower and brush teeth more frequently?,"Do it at the same time every day and tie it in with things that you enjoy. For example, only listen to a podcast or certain music that you like when doing this activities. You can also download apps for tracking daily activities. I really fun one that uses a video game model is Habitica. Everytime you complete a habit or goal you get experience points to help you fight monsters.","

1. Set a daily routine: Pick times of the day to shower and brush your teeth and stick with it. This could be when you wake up, before bed, or right after meals.

2. Put it in your schedule: If it helps, note it down in your calendar or planner so it’s easier to remember to do it.

3. Have all the supplies: Make sure you have all the necessary supplies like a toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, and a towel in the bathroom so you’re ready to go.

4. Make it fun: Play music while you shower or find some new toothpaste flavours to try.

5. Use a timer: Set a timer for two minutes while you brush your teeth so you know you’re getting a full clean.

6. Find an accountability partner: Ask a friend or family member to help you stay on track with your routine and also give you a little reminder when needed."
80,A guy who was in the same class as me when we were in elementary school (the first 5 years of school here) just messaged me and asked if I wanted to join a group chat with him and some people from back then. How do I politely tell him no?,Don't respond at all.,"

Hey there, thanks so much for thinking of me. It's really nice to hear from you after all these years. Unfortunately, I'm unable to commit to the group chat due to my current workload and time constraints. Wishing you all the best though! "
81,Why are diehard sports fans so irrational towards opposing fans and players?,Trust me when I say sports fans hate one certain player in their team more than anything else. More than opposition as well.,"

Sports fandom is often seen as a way of finding affiliation and a sense of belonging in a group. When a rival team is seen as a threat to one’s team, irrational reactions are often seen as a result of feeling attacked in some way. Sports rivalries also often tap into ties to towns, cities, and regions, which produce even stronger reactions. These reactions can be rooted in deeper socio-political reasons, such as a history of animosity or a sense of competition. On a more basic level, it may also be that the fan is just very passionate about their team and protective when it comes to perceived threats."
82,How much water would a citizen have to hoard for it to impact the local ecosystem enough to be noticed?,"Hi /u/AstroPop2023,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

It would depend on the size of the local ecosystem and the water-usage patterns of its inhabitants. Generally speaking, hoarding a significant amount of water (tens or even hundreds of thousands of gallons) could have a noticeable impact on the local ecosystem. However, the exact amount would need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."
83,What do people think about when they are buying expensive designer things?,"A lot of cynical, non serious answers here so far. 

""This is better quality.""

""This will look perfect with my [item] at that [event].""

""Self care."" (Lol i know it's goofy but retail therapy is a thing).","

People typically think about the quality, brand recognition, fashionable style, and exclusivity when considering buying expensive designer items. For those with the means to purchase luxury items, they may also think about the feeling of status and extravagance that comes with owning these products. They may also consider the reputation of the designer and the perceived value they get out of investing in that specific product."
84,"If Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, where does the energy of the living go when they die?","It's heat and electrical energy, it dissipates into the environment.


There's no ""life energy""","

When living organisms die, the energy that was sustaining them is released back into the environment in various forms such as heat, light, and sound. This energy is then recycled in the ecosystem, briefly stored in other organisms or simply dissipated as heat. Ultimately, no energy is lost, but it is constantly redistributed."
85,Would your 10 yo self be proud of you?,"I honestly don’t think that at 10 years old I had an concept of future me.  I was very much in the present. I think if we went to me when I got into my teens.  That’s s different story.   I think the only thing my 10 year old self would be disappointed about was my art.  I was born is with modicum of ability to draw, doodle and paint and at 10 it seemed really impressive to my family, classmates and friends.  Everyone was sure I would go into the arts (except my parents who wanted something stable ). But my abilities never matured and being an artist never came to pass.","

Yes, I would hope so."
86,"Anyone just love to talk to people over text or in person, but absolutely annoyed with phone calls?",I'm the complete opposite. I get annoyed exchanging a million texts - just pick up the damned phone.,"

Yes, I think many people feel this way. Phone calls can sometimes be inconvenient and hard to fit into a busy schedule. Texting or chatting in person can provide the same connection without feeling as rushed or needing to be available at a certain time."
87,Why does my loft apartment get warmer when it rains?,Does the temperature actually increase or does it just feel warmer? Typically more humid air will feel warmer.,"

Loft apartments typically have high ceilings and lots of windows and do not have insulation like other types of buildings. When it rains, the windows trap in heat because of the increased moisture in the air and the rain acts like a barrier to prevent the warm air from escaping. This traps the heat inside your loft and makes the space hotter."
88,How do you organise multiple cables and wires?,"Hi /u/baveod,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

1. Group together similar types of cables and wires.
2. Secure cables and wires to the walls, floors, or ceilings using wall clips, cable straps, or metal conduits.
3. Label or colour code different cables and wires to make it easier to identify them.
4. Place larger cables and wires along the bottom of the group, and secure them in place with cable ties.
5. Arrange the wires and cables in a neat pattern to make them look more orderly and less cluttered.
6. Use cable winders or plastic corrugated sleeves to bundle multiple wires together.
7. Employ network rack systems to neatly organise and store multiple cables and wires."
89,"Let's say a woman is destroying your beautiful car and you seeing this smack the shit out of her , what charges could be brought up against you? Or is there any way could you could get away with it ?","Most likely battery.

You'd be way better off just filming it and suing the shit out of her."," 

If you hit the woman, you could be charged with battery. Even if you were protecting your property, it is illegal to use physical force against another person. There is no ""getting away"" with it, and even if it is ruled that the action was justified, you may still face criminal charges."
90,Why does the food that I make in the airfrier tastes weird?,Maybe you're mistaking fish sticks for potatoes?,"

The airfryer works by circulating hot air around the food, and the temperature of the air is much higher than in a traditional oven. This can lead to the food cooking more quickly, and not having enough time to absorb all of the flavors and ingredients. It can also be due to the size and quantity of the food that you are cooking, as a full airfryer may not cook as evenly as a smaller batch. Additionally, some airfryers may require different cooking times than traditional ovens, so make sure that you are following the instructions for the particular make and model of airfryer that you have."
91,Why do people take multiple years of self defense courses instead of just weightlifting for a year and choke slamming any threat?,It doesn't really work like that. As a woman I'm petite so brute strength wouldn't help me much against a guy who is much bigger/taller than me. With martial arts and whatnot you can overpower someone who is bigger than you using smart techniques.,"

Self defense courses teach more than just physical skills. They teach students to recognize the signs of a potentially violent situation and to use strategies to avoid and de-escalate violent situations. Weightlifting alone will not equip a person with the proper skills to handle social and physical confrontations. Self defense courses also focus on teaching students mental and psychological skills such as self-confidence, situational awareness, how to read people, and negotiation techniques which cannot be acquired through physical training alone. By using multiple years of self defense courses, students can learn more advanced physical techniques such as weapon defense, ground defense, and submissions in addition to mental and psychological skills."
92,"Is it illegal to sell malware infected usb sticks for ""educational purposes"".",You think juries are idiots?,"

Yes, it is illegal to sell malware-infected USB sticks for any purpose. Furthermore, many countries have laws and regulations around the sale and distribution of malicious software, such as malware, and doing so can result in serious consequences."
93,Health insurance in MA,"Have him contact his psychiatric provider, assuming he has a psychiatrist and not just a regular doctor prescribing his meds. I lost my insurance in July, and I’m on 4 different meds daily. An antidepressant, antipsychotic, BPD medication, and clonazepam for anxiety. I was freaking out because without these meds that I’ve been on for years I just knew something bad was going to happen if I didn’t have them. 

I went to my psychiatrist’s office and explained the situation and they gave me papers to fill out to continue to receive free appointments. I have to see the doctor for med management every 3 months because one of my meds are a controlled substance, so he can’t just give them to me without regular appointments. I still have to pay full price monthly at the pharmacy ($175) but the appointments themselves will be free of charge.

Edit to add that if I had to pay for the appointments themselves it would be an estimate of $800. We could pay it if absolutely necessary, but I’m glad I decided to go the route of at least checking on free options first.","

The Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law of 2006 provides a number of insurance options for residents of the state. All Massachusetts residents are required to have health insurance in order to comply with the law. The types of health insurance available in the state include employer-sponsored plans, Medicaid, Medicare, the Health Connector, and private insurance plans. Employer-sponsored plans are available in Massachusetts through employers who offer them to their employees. Medicaid is a free health insurance program for low-income individuals and families. Medicare is a Federal insurance program for people age 65 and older, people with disabilities, and some with specific medical conditions. The Health Connector is an online health insurance marketplace where residents can purchase health plans from private insurance companies. Private insurance plans are available through insurance companies, agents, and brokers. They generally require premiums and may also require copays and deductibles."
94,What is the worst state to live in the United States?,"Really depends on your circumstances and demographics: your age, race, sex, and socioeconomic status.","

This is a subjective question, and the answer will depend on the individual and their unique circumstances. Some people may prefer a modern urban lifestyle in states like California or New York, while others may prefer a more rural lifestyle in states like Idaho or Wyoming. Ultimately, the best state for someone to live in is a matter of personal preference."
95,How enjoyable is it to slander your coworkers and make their lives hell?,I would imagine the people who do this are not self aware. I bet they think they are the victim.,"

It is not enjoyable in any way to slander your coworkers and make their lives hell. Doing so will only damage any potential relationships at work and create a tense and hostile work environment. It is also wrong and unethical to do this and can have serious consequences for both you and your coworkers."
96,Is it safe to eat frozen vegetables that you microwaved in a bag you did not open and then stored in the refrigerator?,"How do they smell? Generally, yes it’s probably safe if it hasn’t been in the fridge too long","

Yes, it is safe to eat frozen vegetables microwaved in a bag that you didn't open and then stored in the refrigerator. However, the quality and taste of the vegetables may not be as good as fresh vegetables. It's best to eat them within a couple of days."
97,What do you do when you sometimes miss your ex even after couple of years?,Nothing?,"

More than anything, it's important to remember that it's completely natural to still feel connected to your ex after a long time – it's a sign that you had something special, and it doesn't have to mean anything bad. Take some time to yourself to think through your feelings and be honest with yourself as to why you miss your ex. Maybe you can write in a journal or find a creative outlet like drawing or painting to express these emotions. If you're feeling particularly overwhelmed, it can also help to talk to a trusted friend or professional about your feelings."
98,Is there a food item/chewable with the texture of skin??,Well… do you eat animal products?,"

No, not to our knowledge. There are edible items that may have a similar texture to skin, such as certain all-natural gummies, but nothing specifically designed for dogs that has the same texture."
99,Why can’t robots pass Captcha tests?,"The older style was distorted letters and numbers done in such a way that it was extremely difficult for image recognition software to figure out what it said.  Unfortunately technology has marched on and now software can complete them - it actually got to the point where the characters had to get so distorted actual humans were failing Captcha more frequently than robots!  Which is why you see the older style Captchas infrequently if at all.

The newer style, reCaptcha, uses a completely different method.  It looks at how you use the computer and internet.  That's why it's often a ""not a robot"" checkbox and nothing else.  It's looking at reaction times, how steady your mouse movements are, what kind of computer you're using, and even your browsing history (you agree to it by using the service, thank you google and overlybroad terms of use).  People and robots use computers very differently, even if the robot is designed to mimic how a person uses the computer.  If it's still not sure by the time you click the checkbox then you go to the ""click all squares containing.""  which gives it more chances to look at how the computer is being used to determine if it's a person or not.

And while google is cagey about how it all actually works, for obvious reasons, I'm also reasonably confident you're also training their image recognition engine at the same time.","

Robots cannot pass Captcha tests because they lack the ability to interpret the text and image content the same way a human would. Captcha tests are designed to be resistant to automated bots in order to protect websites from malicious actors."
100,Why do people cheer for college football teams they have no relation to?,"Because it's fun, and perhaps you like the coach, their history, etc. Or it could be the team closest to whatever city you live in.

Or, of course, the school you went to might have a really shitty football program.","

The concept of ""being a fan"" of a particular college football team is a strong source of pride and identity for many people, and even those who have no direct relation to the school or team often feel a certain degree of loyalty and admiration for its players and coaches. In addition, there are often deep ties between certain schools and particular regions or communities, creating a shared sense of community that is expressed and celebrated through support for the school's team. Additionally, college football culture is heavily embedded into many traditional and social activities, making it a highly visible and popular sport, which further encourages people to become involved with the team."
101,"Do you think children should be featured in commercials and packages? If yes or no, why?",Yes. No reason not to.,"

Yes, I think children should be featured in commercials and packages if they are age-appropriate. When a child is used, the product is more appealing and inviting, encouraging the viewer or buyer to take action. Furthermore, children bring a sense of innocence, energy and playfulness to any commercial or package, which can be used to promote family-friendly products and services."
102,Are there women who are addicted to masturbation?,Yes obviously there are,"

Yes. Like any other addiction, women can develop a compulsive need to masturbate that interferes with their ability to regulate their behavior and live a healthy, fulfilling life."
103,Which specific type of speaker can handle brown noise at a high volume without blowing out the speaker?,"Love some brown noise, sorry though I don’t have a answer.","

Subwoofers are typically the best type of speaker for handling high volumes of brown noise. If you are looking for a speaker that can reach a high volume, then look for a subwoofer with a high power rating."
104,Why do bar soaps smell weird and kinda bad when I wash my groin with it?,"I know what you're talking about, but I don't know why the weird odor happens.","

Soaps have different scents, and many may be unpleasant if used in the groin area. This could be due to the fact that the skin in this area is more sensitive, so it may be reacting to the ingredients in the soap. It is also possible that the harshness of the soap is causing an unpleasant smell. If you have sensitive skin, it's best to use a mild soap specifically designed for the groin area."
105,"Morticians of Reddit, What is the psychological impact when you embalm Children, Teens, Or the Elderly?","Hi /u/GrassDry1295,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

As a mortician, it is important to be aware of the psychological impact of any death. Embalming the body of a child or a teenager can feel like an unbearable burden, as these stages of life have not yet reached emotional maturity. I have to be particularly sensitive when a parent must say their final goodbyes to a child or a young person. Likewise, elderly people can often seem like innocent victims of life’s events and can be emotionally difficult to work with. It is important to remember that you did not cause these deaths, only the deceased’s Creator can do that. Embalming children and elderly people forces me to confront life’s fragility, mortality, and the sobering reminder that despite our efforts, life is fleeting. It is a very sensitive and emotional process, and one that I take very seriously."
106,What would happen if the US went back on the gold standard?,"Well, the first thing is that either every single dollar would suddenly be worth way less, or there'd have to be many, many fewer dollars available in the economy. The US does not own much gold. That alone would send the economy into a tailspin.

From there, there's no way to know exactly what would happen (assuming the gold standard is committed to). Probably some countries would ask for the gold value of all the dollars they currently hold. Probably some countries would go into sympathetic economic downturns. A lot of people would probably die unnecessarily due to the knock-on consequences.

I think this would be bad.","

If the US went back on the gold standard, the US dollar would be pegged to the stable market price of gold, meaning its value would be tied to the value of gold. This would limit the money supply, making it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to respond to economic crisis and adjust to economic cycles, as the gold standard requires a fixed amount of money in circulation. Additionally, the cost of holding and trading gold would likely drive the cost of goods and services up, making things more expensive for everyday Americans."
107,Why are gender pronouns a huge deal in US/Canada while the rest of the world couldn't care less?,are they really? I've only ever witnessed them as a thing online.,"

Gender pronouns are a bigger issue in the United States and Canada because there is a larger social movement to recognize and respect gender identity and combat transgender discrimination. For many people, being referred to by the wrong pronoun or having their identity denied can be very hurtful and can have serious consequences for their mental and emotional well-being. In other parts of the world, transgender discrimination is still an issue, but the discussion surrounding it may not be as prominent or widespread as it is in the United States and Canada."
108,"If I don't ask my girlfriend out for a date, she'd never ask me out, what should I do?","Tell her, not reddit.","

It depends on what kind of relationship you have with your girlfriend. If you feel comfortable with taking the lead and asking her out, then go ahead. However, if you would like her to demonstrate interest in taking initiative, then you can talk to her and see if she might be interested in going out on a date. If she's not, then maybe you can suggest an activity or occasion that both of you can share instead of a formal date."
109,"I'm a landlord of a property that I own, thinking about raising rent $1,000 come next year's lease. Is there anything the tenant can do to refute this?",You need a lawyer to answer your real estate law questions in your jurisdiction.,"

Yes, a tenant can refute the proposed rent increase by providing the landlord with proof that their current rent is within the legal rent cap set by their local municipality. In some cases, a tenant may also be able to challenge the proposed rent increase in court or make an official appeal to their city's rent arbitration board. In addition, the tenant can try to negotiate with the landlord for a smaller rent increase or other concessions."
110,Best way to learn cooking for a complete beginner ?,Watch Alton Brown’s “Good Eats” to learn techniques and science behind cooking reactions to learn fundamentals that can be applied to many dishes.,"

1. Start by learning some basic cooking terminology.

2. Check out online recipes and practice the techniques.

3. Read cookbooks and watch cooking shows to find out the ins and outs.

4. Talk to experienced cooks to learn more tips and tricks.

5. Use practice and experimentation to hone your skills.

6. Stop worrying about perfection and learn to love the process."
111,why are people with tattoos seen as intimidating?,Coz they’re usually hot,"

People with tattoos can be seen as intimidating for a variety of reasons. Some think tattoos are a sign of strength and confidence, while others consider them to be a sign of rebellion or aggression. People with tattoos often have a tough outward appearance, which can make them seem intimidating to some. Tattoos may also represent certain values, ideals, and cultures, which could be off-putting to those who don’t understand or relate to them."
112,This Boebert story makes me want to ask why people even want to be famous?,"Fame often comes with money, and everyone wants more money."," It's understandable that some people may enjoy the status, recognition, and social capital that comes along with fame, but with it comes a great amount of scrutiny and criticism, and can even lead to a loss of privacy. It's important to consider the pros and cons before seeking fame."
113,Why are the subregions of Europe so much smaller than the subregions of all the other continents?,Isn't this question directly contrary to the name of the sub reddit?,"

Europe is the smallest continent in the world, with a landmass of 10.180 million km², compared to 28.7 million km² for Asia, 42.1 million km² for Africa, and 28.7 million km² for North America. As a result, the subregions of Europe tend to be much smaller than the subregions of the other continents due to Europe's limited landmass."
114,my man has a sex list but won’t let me see it,"Hi /u/Realistic-Access4333,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

Otherwise, welcome!

It sounds like the two of you may need to have a discussion about boundaries and expectations in your relationship. You should talk to your partner about why they feel the need to keep the list from you and make sure that you both feel comfortable and respected in the relationship."
115,What’s the equivalent of “sober” when it comes to weed and drug?,Sober.,"

The equivalent of “sober” when it comes to weed and drugs is “clean” or “drug-free”."
116,Why don't we breed the anxiety out of cheetahs?,"First you would have to find cheetahs that already have that trait to breed with. If nobody has such a cheetah already, we are far from having the genetic knowledge to synthesize a trait that doesn't already exist.","

It is not possible to breed the anxiety out of cheetahs. Anxiety is a natural behavior that serves an important purpose for the animal. Cheetahs need to be alert for predators and carefully assess situations before making decisions about when to run or stand their ground. Additionally, cheetah behavior is largely decided by their genetic makeup, and a majority of their anxiety levels cannot be altered through breeding."
117,"[SERIOUS] Why does this subreddit, and a lot of Reddit in general, jump so quickly to “you should divorce/break up with that person”?",People present misery and do nothing about it. Experienced people suggest the most common solution that may have worked for them.,"

Unfortunately, Reddit has built up somewhat of a reputation for being overly opinionated and sometimes dismissive of wider conversations about relationships and interpersonal issues. It can be a double-edged sword in a way because it means that many members have an extreme opinion on many topics. 

At the same time, this ""divorce/break up with that person"" mentality can be driven by the desire to ensure that people are not taken advantage of, abused, or enabling toxic behavior. People may jump so quickly to this solution because they simply don't know the other person's situation and feel a sense of urgency to protect them from it. Thus, they make a blanket statement of the ""solution"" which is often not the best option.

When it comes to interpersonal relationships, it really isn't a simple black and white answer. Everyone's circumstances are different and can be complex. It is important to remember that there are always other available options, and that the decision to stay in or end a relationship is a tough one that should not be taken lightly."
118,Dumb physics question,"The weight of the whole thing would still be 276 in the second situation.

The resistance band pulls *you* up with 25 lbs of force by pulling *down* on the bar it’s attached to with 25lbs of force, so the pull-up bar is still ultimately holding it all up.","

What is the energy of a 10-kg ball travelling at 10 m/s?

The energy of a 10 kg ball travelling at 10 m/s is 500 joules (J). This can be calculated by multiplying the mass of the ball (10 kg) by the square of its velocity (10 m/s) and then dividing the result by two (E=1/2mv2)."
119,"Who wins the fight, an African wild dog versus an American Pitt Bull Terrier?",Wild dog due to climate,"

It is impossible to say who would win this fight, as it would depend largely on the size and strength of the individual animals, as well as their levels of aggression and training. Both species are strong and powerful, and neither would likely back down without a fight."
120,Is it normal that for overuse of Reddit to lead to feelings of despair?,"Yes, any social media really.","

No, it is not normal for overuse of Reddit to lead to feelings of despair. It is possible for someone to become overly consumed in an activity, like Reddit, and as a result feel overwhelmed and depressed. If this is occurring, it may be advisable to take a break from Reddit, and instead focus on activities that can help restore balance."
121,Are dating apps a good option?,"It is good to try different dating apps, since you'll find different kinds of people looking for different things. If one isn't working for you, another one might. I struggle with the apps, but I think they're okay as long as you limit the amount of time you dedicate to them and have some idea of what you want (and what you don't want).



Also, don't rush into anything. I am pretty lonely too and also worry about being able to find a long-term romantic partner, but I'd also like to make sure I find a good fit and someone I feel committed to rather than someone who is convenient.","

Yes, dating apps can be a good option, depending on what kind of relationship you're looking for. Dating apps can be a great way to expand your social circle, so they're especially good for people who are new to an area or are looking for casual hookups. However, if you're hoping to find something serious, dating apps may not always be the best option. There's no guarantee that people are looking for the same things, so it's important to communicate your intentions upfront."
122,Is there a single country capitalism has worked out?,"You would have to defined what it means for capitalism to ""work out"" first.","

It is difficult to definitively answer this question, as there are many different definitions of what constitutes a successful capitalist system. Some economists and scholars contend that capitalism has been successful in some countries, while others suggest it has not been successful in any country. It is also important to consider that economic success is not the only measure of a successful system. Capitalism can lead to varying degrees of economic and social outcomes, and the success of a system must be judged in terms of its overall impacts."
123,“Carne Asada”,"Because that's used in English where the words ""carne asada"" don't mean anything to most people - adding the English steak, adds context.","

Carne Asada is a classic Mexican dish made of marinated, grilled, and sliced steak. The marinated steak is often served on a tortilla with onion, cilantro, lime, guacamole, and Mexican hot sauces. It is typically served at Mexican restaurants, but can be made in the home as well. Carne Asada is a popular dish in the US Southwest, Mexico, and Latin American countries."
124,Why did Desantis run? It just seems so dumb from every point of view,"Hi /u/Weak_Wind_2164,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

Ron DeSantis ran for Governor of Florida in 2018 because he believed he had the necessary experience and qualifications to be successful in the role. He had served in the US House of Representatives since 2013, bringing with him a background in law, the military, government, and business. Additionally, he was backed by President Donald Trump, who endorsed DeSantis and held multiple rallies for him during the campaign. Ultimately, DeSantis won the election and was sworn into office in January 2019."
125,If anything you said became real/true what would you say?,i am a happy person with 50 billion dollars in my bank account married to the girl of my dreams,"

I wish for a world where everyone is free, equal, and safe; where we can all strive to achieve our dreams without fear or obstruction."
126,How do you define being religious?,America.,"

Being religious is an individual's personal set of beliefs, practices, and values that are based on the teachings of a particular religion. It is the majority of individuals embracing a spiritual or philosophical belief system and following those teachings with dedication and commitment. Being religious is generally accepted to include the practice of rituals, meditation, prayer, and other practices meant to deepen an individual’s connection with their faith and spiritual beliefs."
127,How do I politely ask my girlfriend to shave/clean herself?,Just ask her straight out.,"

It is best to phrase your request in a way that emphasizes that you value her and the relationship. Making your request in a gentle and caring manner is important. You could say, ""I really value our relationship and hope you understand that I would really appreciate it if you could shave/clean yourself. Would you be able to do that for me?"""
128,How come we used to be able to just join cults or extremist groups?,"Uh, what do you think's happening on 4chan or Gab or any number of other rightwing hives?","

Cults and extremist groups have typically been formed by people seeking acceptance and belonging. Over the years, different cults and extremist groups have gained traction, either due to their unique beliefs or ideas, or as a response to a particular social or political situation. Unfortunately, in some cases these groups have ended up becoming dangerous, engaging in illegal activities or promoting hatred and violence. Therefore, it has become more difficult to join these groups as law enforcement agencies have become increasingly vigilant in monitoring them."
129,"The ""gold and white"" dress looks black and blue to me now, how?","things look different in different colored lights.  so you're brain thinks about the color of the light your in.  and it's subconsciously corrects for that when you look at stuff.   

in this photo, there is not enough visual data for the brain to figure out what color light the dress is in","

It's likely that the dress is actually a combination of both gold and white, but in certain lighting conditions, such as lower levels of artificial or natural light, the white appears more navy blue, and the gold may appear darker, like a black color."
130,Would lightning chain on a roof covered in lightning rods?,"No, all those rods do not have the correct _""opposite""_ charges in them. The lightning will seek the earth/ground.

Now, if you had some kind of magnetic/electrically-charged lighting rods with the correct _""alternating/opposite""_ charges then the lightning may bounce around between the rods for a split second but it would definitely overwhelm whatever man-made system is charging all the rods.

The rods would quickly end up all having the same kind of charge and the lightning will just go to the ground. 

All of this would happen in less than a second.","

It is possible for lightning to chain on a roof covered in lightning rods, but the amount of potential chaining would depend on the nature of the structure and the distance between the lightning rods. It is generally recommended to space lightning rods as far apart as possible to reduce the potential for lightning chaining."
131,Why aren’t American cities big on tourism?,"The tourism industry makes up 3% of America's spending and receives one sixth of all tourists in the world. 

Maybe you're not finding it, but it's there. Yes, it's expensive - but wages in America are higher than China. I've travelled to a number of American cities and always been able to find attractions - water parks, indoor playgrounds, beaches, museums, etc.","

There are a variety of reasons why American cities may not be as big on tourism as other countries or cities. Reasons include a lack of infrastructure for tourists such as hotels, restaurants, or transportation; certain cities not having unique attractions or experiences that draw tourists; a high crime rate; or a location that is inconvenient for travelers to reach. Additionally, some American cities may not have invested time and resources into marketing their destination to potential tourists."
132,Does the emptiness ever go away ?,"Hi /u/Important-Pay9083,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

The emptiness is a natural part of life that never really goes away. It's important to accept it and learn to cope with it in healthy ways — such as through self-care or support from friends and family. We all experience periods of emptiness, and it can become a powerful source of motivation and inspiration. Emptiness can be seen as a space to invite in more meaningful and fulfilling experiences."
133,"Who the hell is buying these ""Raycon"" headphones?",They make lots of stuff.,"

Raycon earphones are likely being bought by people looking for quality sound at an affordable price. They are popular with music lovers, gamers, and travelers. Some of their more popular models are the Raycon E50 and the Raycon E25, both of which feature Bluetooth capability and hands-free calling."
134,"If Chernobyl never happened, would we still have a energy crisis?","There would still be Three Mile Island and Fukushima to give nuclear a bad name, and nuclear would still be one of the highest startup costs of any kind of energy. Plus, it's unclear if there's enough fissionable materials on Earth to supply all our energy needs for long.

But I agree it would be nice to use it more.","

It is difficult to say definitively as the energy crisis is a complex issue that encompasses many factors, ranging from economic issues to converting to greener, more sustainable sources of energy. However, it is likely that even if Chernobyl had not happened, many of the same issues that are currently causing the energy crisis would still be in play."
135,Why did Katy Perry go from the most famous person ever to a nobody?,Reddit found out her breasts weren't real.,"

Katy Perry has not gone from being the ""most famous person ever"" to a nobody. Perry is still a very successful and popular musician. At times, certain events can shift public interest in certain celebrities, leading to a decline in their top-of-mind presence. In Katy Perry's case, it may be due to a combination of factors, including the decreasing relevance of her particular brand of pop music in current Top 40 trends, her waning public presence and the distraction of personal events in her private life."
136,Why is it not Father Nature?,"Mothers are the ones that ""give life"".","

Father Nature is not an official scientific term. It is often used as a poetic phrase to refer to the power of nature and its ability to provide life-giving resources, but it does not refer accurately to a scientific concept."
137,How should APA citations be ordered?,"That's not APA.

For in-text citations, APA would be :

Frye (Year Frye said it) said X, Andrews (Year Andrews said it) said Y

The reference list is ordered alphabetically, so something like

Andrews, etcetctec

Frye, etcetcetc","

APA citations should be ordered alphabetically by author’s last name. If there are multiple works by the same author, the works should then be ordered by year, with the oldest work first. 

In-text citations should follow the author-date system, wherein the author’s last name and the year of the work in parentheses are inserted at the appropriate points in the text. For example: (Smith, 2020)."
138,"When I had a dream about fighting someone and throwing punches at them, why did my arms actually ache when I woke up ?",There's a very real & likely possibility your real-life arms were moving or at least the muscles were tensing up.,"

When you were dreaming, your body reacted as if you were actually fighting. The physical sensations, such as punching and having your arms ache, were a kind of physical memory of the dream. This phenomenon is known as ""muscle memory"" and can be seen in many different contexts."
139,"For a written debate with an introduction and Rebuttal, should the appendix go with the introduction or should it go with the Rebuttal?","If they are separate related documents, then put the appendix with the one where these items first come up. 

If they are completely separate documents, and the items are in both, then put it with both of them. 

If they’re together in a single document, then at the end of the entire document.","

The appendix should go with the Rebuttal. This is because the introduction and Rebuttal are separate sections of the debate and it makes more sense to have associated resources included with each section. The appendix should provide additional evidence to support the points made in the Rebuttal section, allowing readers to get an in-depth look at the arguments presented."
140,Is there a way to make English not need any pronouns or personal names what so ever?,"Do you remember their names? If you do, could you not just use those?

In my experience, if you don’t know someone’s name or their pronouns, you can literally just use *they*. “They’re over there,” for example.","

Yes, this is possible. You can use a complicated sentence structure and avoid pronouns and personal names when writing in English. Examples of this include using the passive voice, noun phrases to refer to people, and describing actions without using personal pronouns. For example: “Mistakes were made,” or “A plate of food was eaten.”"
141,Can I put any kind of sound system in my car??,"Speakers is easy.  Correct size and suitable power rating should work, anywhere selling them where you can listen to them (which you should) should also be able to advise on compatibility - if they can't then go elsewhere.

The rest is more complicated though.  Car stereos used to fit into a standard size slot and be relatively easy to swap out for something else (or add to a car that didn't have one as standard).  These days they tend to be a lot more integrated into the car's other electronics.","

Yes, you can install any kind of sound system in your car, as long as it is appropriately sized for the space. Be sure to consult with an expert to ensure that the system you are installing is compatible with your vehicle’s electrical system."
142,Can we all come to a collective agreement to not rent a house or a townhouse?,"Most the time: 1-The rich are organized and united 2-Companies  are organized and united  3-The poor/working class are not organized and not united  4-conumers are not organized and not united .. however, when workers/consumers unite, WONDERFUL things happen ...BUT REMEMBER: it's anti-Semitic to unite against rich landlords or banks.","

No, it is up to each individual to decide whether or not to rent a house or a townhouse. Collective agreement cannot be reached if everyone does not agree to the same terms and conditions, and it is unlikely that everyone will agree to the same policy in this case."
143,Is it true that there are some people out there who unironically support Russia's invasion?,"Hi /u/Fantastic_Mud4395,

146,Is sleeping for two four-hour intervals the same as sleeping for eight hours?,"Used to be the way everyone did it.
A straight 8 hours of sleep is a fairly new idea.

So it worked for hundreds of years, might work for you.

In case you want to read up.  
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220107-the-lost-medieval-habit-of-biphasic-sleep","

No, it is not the same as sleeping for eight hours. Eight hours of sleep is generally considered optimal for most people, while four hours of sleep is suboptimal and thought to be potentially unhealthy. Research suggests that breaking up sleep in two four-hour intervals is linked to fatigue, cognitive impairment, and a higher risk of health problems."
147,How do I start a home excerise routine?,HIT workouts are really good that you could do in your house and burn probably just under twice as many calories as walking. Jump roping is another good option. Both are very intense cardio workouts and will definitely help with increasing your stamina and fitness. Walking is great as well and I would still recommend doing that maybe every night because it's very relaxing and helps keep you in shape.,"

1. Set Your Goals: Start by figuring out what you want to achieve. Whether it’s to build muscle, increase endurance, or just stay in shape, setting specific goals will help you stay motivated and focused. 

2. Choose the Right Exercises: Choose exercises that target the areas you want to focus on. Consider activities that you enjoy, as this will make your home workout routine something that you look forward to. 

3. Invest in Any Equipment: If you want to do strength or resistance training, choose a few inexpensive pieces of equipment or tools that you can use at home. Kettlebells, resistance bands, and dumbbells are some of the most common items. 

4. Find a Routine or Program: This is optional, but there are many great apps and websites out there that provide workout routines and exercises that you can do at home. 

5. Create a Calendar: It can be difficult to keep yourself motivated while working out at home. Try creating a calendar with specific days/times to workout and set reminders if needed. 

6. Tune into Video Workouts: There are many online videos and tutorials that you can watch or follow to help guide you through a workout. 

7. Set Rewards and Track Your Progress: Set small goals and reward yourself when you achieve them. You could even create a graph or chart to track your progress. "
148,Is the Catholic Church dying?,"i don't know. I'm an excatholic, I abandoned my religion since I was 14. 

Maybe it is. All I can say is that Catholicism has had a lot of scandals over the years. A lot of people distrust it, and maybe that's starting to have an effect on who wants to be associated with it. 

Here in Canada their strongest foothold, at one point, Quebec, outright rejected them and put a number of serious restrictions on what they can do. A lot of people also hate them because of their role in the residential schools and with the First Nations here. 

Like I said, a lot of scandals.","

There is no definitive answer to this question. Some believe that the Catholic Church is dying, while others feel that it is a vibrant and growing faith community. Some suggest that the faith has been weakened by recent events such as the sex abuse scandal, while others point to the Church's sustained global reach, continued philanthropic efforts, and significant charitable contributions as evidence of its strength and vitality. Ultimately, the question of whether or not the Catholic Church is dying will depend on one's interpretation of evidence and trends."
149,Why on earth are desks so expensive,"Inflation, wood is expensive, and people want to make money","?

Desks can be expensive because they come in a variety of sizes, materials, and finishes. They can range from regular desks made of particle board or veneer to more solid wood desks with intricate carvings and inlays. Additionally, many desks come with features such as drawers, file cabinets, and other built-in organizational solutions that can drive up the cost. Finally, some desks are modular and can be configured in different ways to fit your particular needs."
150,What’s up with the popular page lately?,"Can be a combination of bots and/or that's all people are focusing on lately.

One of the many reasons why I have tailored my home page to not include these subs.","

The popular page on social media websites is often designed to show users content that is “trending” or popular at the time. It is dynamic and constantly changing as users interact with different posts and content. It is a way for users to easily see and get involved in conversations that are popular at the moment."

152,Is it true that Mexican coke is a lie and actually use corn syrup like America does?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Coke

Coke for domestic consumption may not contain cane sugar, but Coke marked Hecho en Mexico and exported to the U.S. does.","

Yes, it is true that Mexican Coke is made with cane sugar rather than high-fructose corn syrup, as most American Coke products are. However, the same line of Coca-Cola products in Mexico also offers versions made with corn syrup."
153,PimEyes voice equivilent,This may not be an answer. But I want to point out that the technology is there. We have the ability to ID songs and we have the ability to catalog thousands of sounds. So it may already exist (albeit  probably behind a paywall). Or or it will come soon.,"

PimEyes does not currently have a voice equivalent. It is an image-based reverse search and facial recognition tool that can be used to identify people using photos or videos."
154,Why do your friends suddenly become distant once you announce that you’ve started a business?,Is it MLM?,"

It is possible that your friends may become distant once you announce that you’ve started a business because they may feel intimidated by your success or that they may be envious of your accomplishments. It may also be that they are uncertain on how to support you and your business because they don’t know what to expect from it. It could also be that they feel like they are no longer in the same position as you, which can lead to social awkwardness. Finally, it could be that they are simply busy with their own lives and may need time to adjust to your new schedule."
155,How are indians able to do business in motels & gas stations in America?,"1-They help each other 2-They work/study extremely hard (have no life outside work/school) 3-They save money, they live with VERY LITTLE money, they buy the cheapest things  4- all family is either working and/or studying 5- they take a loan, buy a small motel and THEY LIVE and work in it 6-they buy a bigger one 7- they die, now kids are rich! .. source: I have met tons of them!","

Indians in the U.S. are able to do business in motels and gas stations in America by obtaining the necessary licenses and permits, although the requirements vary by state. Generally, they will need to research the state and local laws for the exact requirements. Potential business owners are likely to need a business license or permit, a tax identification number, a liquor license, an Employer Identification Number (EIN), and other required permits and licenses. Once all of the necessary steps and paperwork are completed, Indians can start their businesses in motels and gas stations."
156,"I had been watches the people destroying their pcs and the parents destroying the consoles, Then is it funny or not?","No, consoles and pcs can get expensive","

No, it is not funny. It is sad and destructive."
157,How to tell someone that no one likes them because of their crappy personality?,"'Its because you're an insufferable bitch '

Seriously though, it sounds like your sister may have a personality disorder. Take that with a grain of salt. Internet stranger and all that. You might get more mileage by asking her what she thinks the reason is. Her answer may be very telling as to how she views herself and others.","

This is not something I would recommend telling someone directly. It can be quite hurtful and damaging to hear such a blunt comment. If you feel it is necessary to communicate this in some way, I suggest speaking to them in a gentle and caring manner. Explain that you have noticed that they are struggling to make meaningful connections and that it can be difficult to create friendships when people don't know what to expect from them. Suggest they look for new hobbies or activities that will help them practice being more sociable, and encourage them to reach out to people who may have similar interests."
158,How can I hide my 'hungry eyes' around people I'm attracted to?,Don't stare.,"

1. Avert your gaze. When you find yourself drawn to someone, make a conscious effort to look away and focus on something else in the room instead.

2. Take a step back. When you're feeling overwhelmed by attraction, take a few steps away to put some physical and emotional distance between you and the object of your affection.

3. Practice controlling your body language. When you're around someone you're attracted to, be mindful of how you're carrying yourself. Make an effort to sit or stand up straight and avoid unnecessary fidgeting or gestures.

4. Develop a mental distraction. Come up with a go-to distraction that you can use whenever you feel your 'hungry eyes' beginning to take over. This might be repeating a mantra, focusing on a particular object in the room or engaging in deep breathing."
159,"If someone attempts to 'physically intimidate' you, but you are not bothered or scared by their actions towards you, is it still 'physical intimidation?'",Yes it is both intimidation and harassment,"

Yes, physical intimidation is when someone attempts to use physical force, threats, or aggression to make you feel threatened or scared. If you are not intimidated by someone's behavior, it does not necessarily mean that they have not attempted physical intimidation."
160,Is it easier to make friends when lose weight?,"Maybe? Depends on if and how your weight is keeping you from making friends. Some people are very insecure about their weight, which in turn may influence your readiness or comfort with making friends.","

It depends. Making friends has more to do with confidence, trustworthiness, and open-mindedness than physical appearance. However, if someone struggling with their weight does lose weight, it can boost their confidence and help them feel more comfortable in social situations. That confidence and comfort could make it easier to make friends."
161,Serious question: would it be kind of sad (for lack of a better term) to lose my virginity to a prostitute as opposed to a girl genuinely into me?,Yes.,"

It really depends on your own opinion and how you feel, and it's ultimately up to you to decide. Some people might think it would be sad, while others may feel it’s a perfectly valid way to become intimate with someone. It's up to you to decide what feels right for you and what you're comfortable with."
162,Is the silent treatment a form of abuse and why?,"If children are treated this way it's abuse. 

If an adult treats another adult such it's whiny, bitchy behaviour and if they can't articulate their feelings even after days it's a definite red flag.","

Yes, the silent treatment is a form of abuse because it is defined as a tactic often used in relationships to punish, control, or manipulate another person. By withholding affection, conversation, acceptance, and/or problem-solving, the silent treatment can be emotionally devastating for the recipient."
163,Why are people always staring at me??,You either do indeed look weird or it's a mental health issue (paranoid delusions).,"

People may be staring at you for various reasons, and it would be difficult to know exactly why without knowing the specific details of the situation. It could be because you are attractive, or you are wearing an interesting outfit, or appear to be behaving differently than others. It is also possible that people are simply curious or that you remind them of someone they know. No matter why people may be staring at you, it is important to remember that it is not your responsibility to make them feel comfortable."
164,How would a man with no limbs eat,Like an animal.,"

A man without limbs could find ways to eat with the assistance of friends, family, or caregivers. One way could be using specially-designed eating utensils or utensils modified to have extended handles that allow the person to use their mouth or chin to grip them. Another way would be by using an adapted table with a surface sloped at an angle that the person can lean against, allowing them to put their plate close enough to reach. They could also use specially designed plates with built-in bases or clamps that can be held in place to prevent food spills. Additionally, they could enlist the help of friends or family to feed them directly."
165,5w charger for iPhone 15,"The 5w charger will be quite slow, but yes you can use it, and you should be able to use the 20w also.","w

No, the minimum required charger for iPhone is 18W."
166,Are adults struggling financially because we have to many kids?,"Given that even adults with zero kids struggle financially, I'm going to say there's probably other reasons besides that.","

No, adults are not struggling financially because they have too many children. In fact, most people are struggling financially for other reasons, such as not being able to find employment that pays well, not having access to affordable housing or health care, or dealing with mounting debts."
167,"Am I weird for finding middle aged, stereotypically geeky looking men very attractive?",Absolutely Not.  that's very normal (says the middle aged geeky looking man),"

No, not at all! Everyone has their own unique tastes in what they find attractive and there's nothing wrong with having a preference for a certain type."
168,Would waxing all of your hair make you a more efficient human?,"Waxing isn't a one-time thing.   The resources you put into maintenance will outweigh any marginal gains damaged follicles would eventually give you. 

A better way would be to only utilize body temperature liquids for bathing and drinking.","

No, waxing all of your hair will not make you a more efficient human. Taking good care of yourself and getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet can help to improve your efficiency."
169,Do you go into relationships just completely trusting?,"I don’t know if you mean romantic relationships, but in the case of friendships I personally don’t","

No. Trust is something earned over time and with effort from both partners."
170,"I often see “that would be a good copypasta”, what constitutes good copypasta?","Usually something overly dramatic about something that isn't actually a big deal, and contains key nouns that can be switched out mad lib style and adapted to other situations.","

Good copypasta can vary depending on individual tastes, but in general it should be concise, entertaining, and have potential for replication and sharing. Good copypasta should also be relatively timeless, making sure to avoid references to specific moments in history, as well as recent pop culture trends. For example, a funny one-liner or pun could be considered good copypasta."
171,Have we figured out how to make gold from alchemy yet?,"No, alchemy wasn't science, and most of it was just plain wrong.","

No, there is no scientific evidence to suggest it is possible to make gold from alchemy. Despite centuries of attempts, alchemy has yet to lead scientists to the discovery of a method for turning ordinary elements into gold."
172,"A restaurant has been putting their tables out on the sidewalk, effectivly blocking the walkways of our downtown? Can I just go sit down at the tables without buying anything?","Probably not but we don't know where you are. 

They may have required permits or rights to do this. The right course of action if you are upset is to complain to your city.","

No, you cannot just sit down at the tables without buying anything. Restaurants typically require customers to purchase something in order to sit at their tables. If there is no room to walk, you should speak with the restaurant manager about moving the tables away from the sidewalk."
173,Why are some people okay with showing their attraction or interest in people?,"You're making the choice to not show your feelings because of some internalized hatred of yourself. Life isn't a conspiracy out to get you. The problem is right there, staring back at you in the mirror.","

Some people are comfortable showing their attraction or interest in people for a variety of reasons. It could be because they feel secure in themselves and their feelings and feel like expressing themselves in this way is a healthy way to express and engage with the person they are attracted to. It could also be because they want to make sure their interest is known and try to avoid any potential misunderstandings or hurt feelings. Ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide what feels comfortable and right for them."

The fastest way to learn to code apps is to find an online course that suits your needs, pick a programming language (like Java or Python), and practice coding every day. Additionally, find coding tutorials online and build example projects. Additionally, connect with other coders in online forum and share knowledge and ask questions to help you learn. Finally, read technical resources and attend tech seminars, webinars and workshops for further development."
175,Why has woody woodpecker been in Netflix top 10 the past week,"* https://www.whattowatch.com/news/what-is-the-woody-woodpecker-movie-and-how-is-it-in-netflixs-top-10
> _""The best theory that I can come up with on the success of Woody Woodpecker on Netflix is perhaps adults with young children are seeing the movie on the streamer, getting fond memories of their childhood and want to introduce their kids to the character. Maybe the kids are enjoying Woody's antics enough for repeat viewings. Netflix doesn't divulge much specific info on viewership, so we may never know what is spurring this surprising Woody Woodpecker revival. But it'll be interesting to see how long the movie hangs in at the top of the Netflix charts.""_

As a father with 2 kids at home, because of your Reddit question I'm now aware of this movie and I'll probably watch it with my kids in the near future.","?

Woody Woodpecker is a family-friendly animated comedy from Universal Pictures, released in 2017 with the voice of comedian and actor Thurop Van Orman. It's made it to Netflix's Top 10 rankings in the past week likely due to its recent release onto the streaming service and the built-in nostalgia that comes with watching the beloved cartoon character from generations past."
176,Do you think that if Hollywood decided to make a movie adaptation of all the original OZ books that they'd do well?,"The Oz books were highly original at the time. Today's landscape is so littered with fantasy that there's no longer any novelty to the genre. And too, the Oz books were heavily laden with turn of the 20th century political and social debate. No one would get the references.","

Yes, I believe that if done right, a movie adaptation of all the original OZ books would be incredibly successful. Depending on the approach, the movie could stay true to the original source material, and remain faithful to the classic story, or use more contemporary aesthetics and special effects to make an adventure that appeals to both long-time fans and newcomers."
177,Change of fee structure Progress or Greed?,"The ultimate goal of every smart consumer company, to the detriment of consumers, is 'Recurring Revenue'. Money that is made on a regular basis with no additional expenditure of effort or resource on the part of the company. This is modelled after the entertainment industry 'work once, paid forever' business model. 

It is nothing but greed, a way to increase the value of the company on the backs of customers with no additional effort. That said, it's smart business because we have proven that we are stupid enough to pay it. 

Every single 'game pass' user simply reinforces to the industry that we will pay every month for something we could have simply purchased. Unity isn't really making much of a change on that model.","

The change of fee structure depends on the particular situation and circumstances surrounding it. On the one hand, if it is meant to promote progress in the industry then it could be seen as an overall beneficial change for everyone. For example, if the change is proposed to create fairer wages for workers or to incentivize innovation, then it could be seen as promoting progress. On the other hand, if the change is simply introduced to increase company profits, then it could be seen as a form of greed. Ultimately, it is impossible to say definitively if a change of fee structure is promoting progress or greed without understanding the specific details of the change."
178,What does it feel like to finally come out of depression and how do you know you’ve finally kicked it - what signs are there?,"Joy, even on boring days, I guess.","

Coming out of depression can be an incredibly freeing experience. The road to recovery can look different for everyone, but the signs can be a feeling of being ‘unstuck’, a lessening of negative thoughts and behaviours, an increase in energy, a desire to engage in activities and relationships again, and more positive thinking and outlook. It can take time, but when you feel these changes taking place, it can be a huge relief and can bring a lot of hope and joy to your life."
179,Why do people say billionaires don’t actually have their money?,"Their worth is tied up in assets. They might have a lot of money in various bank accounts, but the majority lies in stocks and property they own. They could liquidate all their stocks to get hard cash, but if they did that they'd have a lot of taxes to pay and probably bring the price of their stocks down as they were doing it. They still *are* billionaires, of course, and have access to as much money as they need (since it can be given with their assets as collateral), but they generally don't have billions in a bank account or underneath their mattress.","

People might say this because often billionaires don’t have a large amount of liquid assets, meaning they may have most of their money invested and not available in the form of cash. Additionally, it is possible for billionaires to have their money split up between different banks, accounts, and investments in various places, which can lead some to believe that they don’t actually have “their” money, but are rather managing their investments for growth."
180,Opening a Hoarder Clean Up service soon....,"I worked for my local county and nearly every home eschewed to the county for unpaid taxes were almost exclusively hoarder homes.

Hoarder homes are usually derelict wrecks and its rare not to find one in ""the hood"" and they are rarely worth rehabbing.  

Hoarders (that reach the point the city is forcing a clean up) by their nature are usually broke and the properties are usually destroyed by the nature of the hoard.  So theres little money in the business.   And for the properties worth fixing, there is a Enviropro's that specialize in this","

Congratulations on opening a Hoarder Clean Up service! Providing this service can be very rewarding as hoarding is a serious problem that can cause distress and even health issues. In order to be successful, it is important to make sure that you develop your business plan, do your research, identify potential clients, and collaborate with local organizations that can provide resources for hoarders.

1. Develop Your Business Plan: This is an essential step in starting any business. Make sure that your plan covers all aspects of your business, from marketing to financials.

2. Do Your Research: Research hoarding and the services that are offered to hoarders, as well as the laws and regulations that govern such services in your area.

3. Identify Potential Clients: Reach out to your networks to identify potential clients who are in need of hoarding clean up services. You can also visit local organizations that provide resources for hoarders to make connections.

4. Build a Team: It is important to build a team of experienced professionals who can help you with your hoarding clean up services. This could include a psychiatric nurse, a trained coach, and an organization that is knowledgeable with the process. 

5. Legal Considerations: Make sure that you understand the laws and regulation pertaining to hoarders in your area and consult a lawyer if you have questions.

Good luck with your business venture!"
181,Why would people from decades ago check in on me through my sister?,"Yes, this is all perfectly normal. People think about someone or an event in their lives and they become curious as to what the people they knew then are up to. You had a traumatic experience in this vein, so your alarm bells are (understandably) calibrated in an oversensitive way to this type of thing. You might consider asking your sister to just pass along when someone asked about you and then, if you want, you can get in touch with them.","

It is possible that people from decades ago may still be friends with your sister and may want to keep in touch with her. They may use her as a means to check in on you and see how you are doing without having to directly interact with you. They may also simply want to stay up to date on what is happening in your life in order to build a stronger bond with your sister."
182,Why do I get more attention when I am wearing a ring?,I think that was the premise of an episode of Seinfeld. Pretty funny,"

Some people may find rings to be a sign of maturity and responsibility, which can make them more likely to pay attention to you. Additionally, rings often appear to be expensive and fashionable, which can draw the eye."
183,Anyone who's pee shy ever have to take a piss test?,"I didn't have to have one observed, but I did have to take a pee test to get my current job.  I drank at least half a gallon of water and still had to loiter for like 4 hours before I could finally pee on demand.  It sucked and you're definitely not the only one they have to deal with.","

Yes, although they may find it more difficult to provide a specimen than someone who is not pee shy. Some people with pee shyness may require additional support or accommodations to successfully provide a specimen. It is important to talk to the testing facility ahead of time to discuss the individual's needs."
184,Legit question,"It's a group cohesion thing.  ""Yep, we're all old guys around here.  Not as attractive and fit as we once were.""  And being able to react appropriately shows you fit and understand the mores of the group.","

185,Do you think the United States will ever have respect for all political sides after Donald Trump is done with politics?,"The division isn't anything new. There were ""Nixon=Hitler"" protest signs, too. It's just become more acceptable to be a total dick about how much you hate the other side, especially considering there is so much more online talk now than there used to be. So it'll keep going like this, too.","

It is hard to answer this question definitively, but it is possible that, over time, respect for all political sides will increase in the United States after Donald Trump is done with politics. In order for this to happen, all of the political divisions and animosity generated during Trump's time in office will need to be addressed and worked through. This will be a lengthy process, depending on the amount of progress made in the next few years, but it is not impossible."
186,Why is it that when a web page loads it flickers things and jumps all about?,"It's because it's a lot easier to not care about the size of the ads and article crosslinks.  The page loads what's directly on the page and that's a certain size, then as additional ads, both internal and external, load in it changes the size of the page, causing it to jump around.","

When a web page loads, it usually flickers and jumps around due to the browser loading the page in stages. Elements may appear, move, and even disappear while loads, which can be disorienting. To minimize this, web designers use a technique called progressive loading, which means that each part of the page loads slowly and in a sequence, instead of all at once. This can help reduce the amount of flickering and jumping while the page is loading."
187,I (29F) shaved my head and now I feel more fiesty than ever. Can anyone relate?,No,"

Yes, it's great to make a change to your appearance that helps you feel more empowered and confident. My sister shaved her head a few years ago and she said it made her feel very liberated and ready to take on anything. She said she felt like she could take on the world afterwards. It can be a really empowering experience."
188,How to drink from a straw without liquid touching teeth . /where to place straw . ( videos are appreciated),Deepthroat it,"

A great way to drink from a straw without liquid touching your teeth is to start by tilting your head back slightly and pushing the tip of the straw into your mouth. Place the straw in the back corner of your mouth and place your tongue on the roof of your mouth. This will create a pocket and will prevent the liquid from coming in contact with your teeth. The video below can be helpful for visualizing this method:

189,Why does vancomycin have to be infused very slowly?,"Vancomycin can cause Red Man Syndrome, which is basically a rash. They infuse it slowly so they can monitor for this rash before you have a lot of it in your system. A severe reaction to a lot of the agent could cause anaphylactic shock and be life-threatening.","

Vancomycin is a type of antibiotic that has serious potential side effects, such as red man syndrome and kidney toxicity. It is recommended that vancomycin be infused very slowly, typically over a period of two hours, in order to reduce the risk of these side effects. Additionally, the slow infusion allows for the body to absorb the drug at a steady rate, which can increase the effectiveness of the treatment."
190,What your thoughts on vape? And why,"It's gross, just like any other kind of smoking. Worse yet, a lot of people who vape think it ""doesn't count"" and have no problem vaping right in peoples' faces or places where smoking _and vaping_ are not allowed.","?

I believe vaping is not healthy and should be avoided. Studies have linked vaping to acute lung injury as well as negative impacts on the cardiovascular system. Additionally, there is much that we do not know about the long-term impacts of vaping, as it is a fairly new phenomenon. There is a lack of long-term research to accurately judge the potential health impacts of vaping."
191,"With America having such a strong car culture and shitty public transport, how do people with disabilities that prevent them from driving get around?","They find someone to drive them, or they don't get around.  Being homebound is a serious problem for older Americans.","

There are a variety of options for individuals with disabilities who are unable to drive. Depending on their resources, needs, and locality they could arrange personal transportation, such as a taxi or ridesharing service, or they could use public transit or paratransit. With public transit, some cities offer designated bus lines, paratransit vans, and rail lines suited for individuals with disabilities, often at reduced fares. Services like paratransit also provide other services tailored to specific needs, such as door-to-door transport that can help make traveling easier for those with limited mobility. Additionally, there are services that match passengers to volunteer drivers who may be able to provide rides at no or low cost."
192,How much should you pay for the installation of an AC?,"That's going to be a bit - it will require licensed electrical work and cutting holes in the exterior and interior of the home.  

For US, I'd start with a guess of about $500, more or less depending on the materials involved in the structure, accessibility to the install point,  distance to the electrical panel.   Permits might be extra.","

Installation costs for air conditioning units vary widely depending on the size, type, brand, and location of the air conditioning unit. However, on average, you can expect to pay between $1,500 and $5,000 for the installation of an AC unit."
193,Why do I feel so cringe after journaling?,"Because you're being vulnerable.    Don't mistake that for weakness.

Also, what you describe is actually a good thing.  I will journal when feeling bad, then when I reread it later I'm like ""oh, yeah that does seem a bit silly"" and actually helps with anxiety because it forces me to put my feelings into words and you can realize that you don't need to worry as much s your brain is tricking you into thinking you do.","

The feeling of cringe after journaling may be due to a variety of factors. For starters, the act of journaling can be an emotional and vulnerable experience. It can bring up feelings of shame or regret. Additionally, if you perceive yourself as not having enough time to devote to journaling, or feel like you’re not doing it “right,” this can also bring on feelings of inadequacy. It’s important to remember that, when it comes to journaling, there is no right or wrong way. Everyone approaches this practice differently and everyone has a different level of success with it. Consider ways to make the process less stressful or more enjoyable for yourself, such as setting goals, writing for a set amount of time each day, or using prompts to get started."
194,Serieus question. How do you give a bj/hj to a guy with fore skin? Do you like.. keep it how it is or pull it behind iykwim?,You gotta ask him. Everyone's different.,"

This is a great question and it really depends on the preferences of the person receiving the oral pleasure. Some people enjoy having their foreskin pulled back, while others prefer it to remain as is. My best advice would be to ask them beforehand to ensure that you are giving them the most pleasurable experience possible."
195,do they actually arrest the people in the predator hunting videos?,"It depends on the law. Most of the time, they are indeed breaking the law even if there is no actual minor. 

These guys can vary though in how much they work with the police. Most LEOs across the US say such predator hunters should not meet the predators in person, but forward their chat logs to the police and leave it at that. More often than not, although exposing them on their channel does a number on these predators' psyche, their careless attitude and lack of professionalism leads to the individual not being arrested. 

In a number of cases, LEOs have explicitly asked these predator catchers to *stop* because they are *doing more harm than good* and the predators featured in their videos often *get away scott-free*. 

It's not just about whether someone is breaking the law, it's often about whether the state can actually prosecute them based off information gathered by the third party organisations, who often have patreons or a general interest in making more videos on these guys rather than actually getting them arrested.

This is a very touchy subject, but I made a video on a particular organisation a while back, called D.A.P. If you care to, you can watch it [here.](https://youtu.be/VA8pH42B_Q8?si=Y5YqwHcPmt_s1vDA)

Keep in mind that a few months after I posted this video, D.A.P began charging their viewers to watch videos of them physically assaulting the alleged predators and eventually went and got themselves shot in the middle of a grocery store, putting their lives, the innocent bystanders' lives, and the employee's lives in danger.","

No, they do not. The people featured in predator hunting videos are usually acting out a simulated hunting scenario and any animals shot and killed are usually not real."
196,Why is intersex and Trans included in the LGBTIA+ if LGBA are sexualities and intersex and trans more so is about the person?,The community expanded to include more than just sexual orientation.,"

Intersex and trans identities are included in the LGBTIA+ acronym because they both encompass people whose gender identities and/or sexualities vary from what is expected or considered “normal” in society. Intersex people often have biological bodies that do not fit into the binary male-female sex categories, while transgender people identify as a gender different from the one they were assigned at birth. Both intersex and transgender individuals may face discrimination, marginalization, and ostracization, and thus, they both belong to the LGBTQ+ community, which is focused on visibility, acceptance, and advocacy."
197,Do you guys think America has the potential to become the best country but it just fucks itself up every day?,"Claiming to and striving to be the ""best"" is exactly what I think the United States suffers from the most.","

America has the potential to be one of the best countries in the world, but unfortunately it makes mistakes and has issues that hinder its progress. There are many drivers of progress in the United States, and the potential exists for it to become one of the world's best countries in terms of social, economic, and political development. However, there are policy choices and decisions made both domestically and internationally that can stymie America's potential."
198,Which video game do you consider the best purely based on story?,Red Dead 2,"

The Last of Us. It’s a powerful survival story with subtle but poignant themes of love, loss, and hope. The choices you make in the game create an emotional journey that is both harrowing and deeply rewarding."
199,Is it a bad idea to clean a bathtub with a hand drill brush?,You can wear away the enamel.   Get a good soap scum cleaning foam liquid and let that do the heavy work.,"

It depends on the surface and type of material your bathtub is made of. Hand drill brushes can be slightly abrasive and cause damage to ceramic and porcelain surfaces. It is best to always read and follow manufacturer's instructions before attempting to clean your bathtub."
200,Magpies scaring away small bird,No birds are going to be nesting in the winter.,"

Magpies are known to be aggressive towards other smaller birds, often chasing and chasing them in an attempt to drive them away from their territory. Magpies have been known to use intimidation tactics such as vocalizations, dive-bombing, and making physical contact with the smaller birds. However, only the strongest threats tend to be successful, and most small birds can find refuge in dense shrubbery and trees where magpies cannot reach. If the magpies become a problem, bird feeders can be positioned in areas where the magpies cannot reach and where the smaller birds can feed safely."
201,Why do guys send dick pics?,What good is a dick pic?  That can get you into hot water.,"

Sending unsolicited dick pics is completely inappropriate and there is no excuse for it. It can be a way for people to express themselves or an attempt at flattery, but it is still disrespectful and could be considered a form of sexual harassment."
202,What does Screenwriters want from this strike ?,"the big thing is they want AI banned or heavily regulated because it will wipe out their entire industry.

As for the royalties thing, that's often negotiated beforehand.  I have no clue what actually happened with Aaron Paul, but just as a hypothetical - when he was hired for Breaking Bad, the producers said ""OK Aaron, either we'll give you $10,000 an episode, or you can have 0.7% of the royalties if and when the series is syndicated.""  And he picked the sure-thing-money now.","

Screenwriters are demanding better compensation for movie and television writers, including larger salaries, new residuals, additional points, and improved health care and pension plans. They are also protesting the increasing use of uncompensated material in movies and TV shows and demanding more creative rights for writers over their work. Finally, they are seeking an end to the requirement that writers work under the Writers Guild of America's restrictive contracts, which limit their ability to find work and collaborate with other creators."
203,"When people behave like asshats in plane flights, don't they get banned from any given airline?",A lot of people manage to make it through life being a raging douche bag for a surprising amount of time before they ever face meaningful consequences so get accustomed to consequence free douchebaggery. These are the stars of these videos you see.,"

Yes, airlines do have the authority to ban passengers and prevent them from boarding a flight. As part of their rules and regulations, airlines can deny boarding to passengers who are disruptive, intoxicated, overly aggressive, or engaging in any behavior that could endanger the safety and comfort of other passengers or personnel."
204,I'm really upset... what do you guys think in this situation?,"Grow up bruh.

You lost a project, your colleague got the project. Get over it and learn from it.

You are doing work in a field that really doesn’t give many fucks about technical merits. And business in general doesn’t care for what you desire. Arts and entertainment are entirely subjective. You could be a master of your craft and there will be people that vehemently hate your style. Nothing you can do about it.

Maybe his work sucks, as you say. Or maybe it’s not bad and you just can’t take the sting from losing the project. You’re being overly critical to save face, rather than accept that it just didn’t work out.

Maybe being a people pleaser isn’t as bad, especially when you have a paying client that you need to keep happy. Clients like people who are easy to work with. If they are paying you for to bring their vision to life, they don’t want to deal with some bullshit all the time.

A smart man would take the experience and ask themselves what they can do better next time. Being bitter about it comes from the same emotions that got you passed over for the project in the first place.","

It can be difficult to know what to think in these situations, especially when you're feeling so upset. The most important thing is to focus on taking care of yourself, both physically and emotionally. This might include talking to a friend, colleague or counselor, taking some time for yourself, or even engaging in some kind of physical activity. It can also be helpful to take time to think about what you are feeling and what might be causing those emotions. Once you have identified the source of your discomfort, you can start to think of potential solutions. Keep in mind, you don't have to have all the answers right now and it's ok to take some time to process your feelings."
205,Can upu eat the entire pepperoncini minus the stem?,Yes. They are delicious.,"

Yes, you can eat the entire pepperoncini minus the stem."
206,Can someone explain non-duality to me in simple terms?,Is this for your philosophy assignment or something?,"

Non-duality (also known as Advaita) is the philosophical understanding that everything that exists is One, that all of creation is one unified, inseparable whole. It's based on the idea that there are no separate entities, only One. In this state of oneness, there is no duality, no sense of separation, no good and evil, no light and darkness, and no perceivable divisions between the Self and the universe. There is no perceivable difference between the observer and the observed, between our individual lives and the collective existence which we all partake in. Non-duality seeks to dissolve all duality in favor of a single, unified reality. It teaches us to see the Beauty and Divinity within all of existence."
207,How do you buy a house?,"Your first step is to find a real estate agent. For this you can look online for reviews or ask around for recommendations. They will guide you through the rest of the process. You'll also need a loan, so reach out to your bank to get the ball rolling there as well.","

1. Determine How Much You Can Afford: The first step to purchasing a house is determining how much you can afford. Calculate your monthly income, bills, and other debts to estimate the amount of mortgage you can comfortably pay each month.

2. Get Pre-Approved for a Mortgage: Once you have a rough idea of how much you are comfortable spending on a house, you need to get pre-approved for a mortgage. This involves contacting a lender and providing proof of your financials in order to gain approval and receive a loan.

3. Start House Hunting: Now that you know exactly how much you can spend, it’s time to start searching for homes. Start online first and do a broad search. Once you narrow down the right area and type of home you want, you can start going to open houses and meeting with realtors.

4. Make an Offer: Once you’ve found a house you want, the next step is to make an offer. This includes setting a price, agreeing on any additional conditions, and determining a date for completion of the sale.

5. Finalize the Sale: Once your offer is accepted, it’s time to finalize the sale. This includes having the home appraised, getting a mortgage, and transferring title of the home. Once all of these steps are complete, the house is yours!"
208,How long does it take for a bruise from a blood draw to go away? Any way to speed that process up?,"No help this time but to stop it happening again, when the needle is withdrawn press as hard as you can with your thumb on the stick point. Count to 60 slowly and keep pressing hard.
This will stop or at least massively reduce the bruising.
Don't bend your arm while doing this either. Just press hard.","

The healing time for a bruise caused by a blood draw can vary from person to person, but typically it can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. To help speed up the healing process, you should apply a cold compress or ice pack to the area 3-4 times a day for 10-15 minutes for the first 24 hours. Additionally, you may take an over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen to reduce inflammation and pain. Lastly, make sure to keep the area clean and covered with a sterile dressing."
209,Hatsune Miku forum post Mandela effect?,"You misremembered something. Happens to all of us, and it's nothing special.","

The Mandela effect is not something related to Hatsune Miku. It's a phenomenon in which a large number of people remember something incorrectly, even though it didn't happen. It's named after Nelson Mandela, who many people believed had died while he was still held captive in South Africa—he actually lived until he was 95."
210,why don't people just repeat what they said when asked and instead just say more on top of it?,"The time may have allowed for more thinking on their part so there is more information they wish to add. Might also be they are wanting to explain things further to potentially help you out just in case it might be an understanding issue and not a hearing issue (even if you said ""I didn't hear""...they may take it as a more polite way of ""I didn't understand"" so they explain it anyway). 

Just a guess.","

People might not feel comfortable or confident enough to simply repeat what they said. They may not have had enough time to think of an elaborate answer or they may want to add in more context or details for further clarification. Additionally, they may be trying to be more engaging in the conversation and elaborate more on the topic to add depth to the discussion."
211,How do I see a psychiatrist without health insurance?,Lots of them offer sliding scales to make payment more affordable.,"

If you do not have health insurance, there may be services in your area that provide mental health care on a sliding scale or at a reduced cost. You can also contact organizations, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or Mental Health America, to get information about low-cost or free services in your area. Additionally, many counseling centers, community health centers, and universities offer mental health services at a reduced cost."
212,Why hasn’t every country put aside their differences and created a global space agency?, Because those differences are meaningful and substantial.,"

One of the main reasons why every country has not put aside their differences and created a global space agency is because of the cost. Space exploration and research can be expensive to pursue, and many countries may not have the means or resources to commit to a global space agency. Additionally, countries may have different political ideologies regarding the exploration of space and may disagree about the mission and objectives of such an organization. Other factors, such as national interests and security concerns, may also be a major impediment to creating a global space agency. Ultimately, creating a global space agency would require much collaboration and compromise between nations that might not be possible at this time."
213,Which role makes the most amount of money in movies/series?,"Hi /u/Fitcurlydude,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

According to a review of studies from the Screen Actors Guild, the highest-paid roles in movies and series (excluding voiceover and narration roles) are those of lead actors. Other high-paying positions for actors in movies and series include executive producers, director, and supporting actors."
214,How do Dark Web Red Rooms work?,"It is just an urban legend, so it doesn't ""work"" in any way.","

Dark Web Red Rooms are online rooms, accessible only through the dark web, which are said to be used for the purpose of live torture of victims. Rather than a real physical location, Dark Web Red Rooms generate virtual environments in which victims are held captive and subjected to various forms of physical or psychological torture. Victims can be sold into these Red Rooms. There have been several reports that these rooms do exist, although no concrete proof has been provided. In some cases, individuals claiming to own Red Rooms offer live streaming of the torture. It is unclear how individuals pay for access to Red Rooms, however it is speculated to be through virtual currencies such as Bitcoin."
215,How do companies deal with social engineering?,I know McDonald's purposely makes all their uniforms billowy as fuck to deter sexual harassment and fraternizing in the work place.,"

1. Raise Awareness: Companies can educate their employees about the dangers of social engineering by providing regular training, either in person or via video. This training should cover topics such as how to recognize social engineering attacks, how to protect sensitive information, and the consequences of failing to do so. 

2. Establish Protocols and Policies: Companies should also create and enforce protocols and policies related to social engineering. This could include having systems in place for verifying a caller's identity before providing sensitive information or making it a policy to never give out confidential information via email or over the phone.

3. Implement Security Software: Implementing security software such as spyware, anti-virus, and anti-malware can help protect networks and devices from social engineering attacks. These tools should be updates regularly with the latest security patches and updates. 

4. Create a Security Response Plan: Companies should also create an effective security response plan in case of a social engineering attack. This plan should detail the steps to be taken, the responsible parties, and the expected timeline for an investigation."
216,How do I convince my wife and kids to clean up after themselves?,"If you figure it out, please let me know","

1. Start with emphasizing the importance of cleanliness. Explain that an organized, clean space will be beneficial for everyone and will make life easier and more enjoyable.

2. Communicate expectations in a clear and concise way. Make sure they understand what you are asking and what the consequences are for not complying.

3. Create a system that encourages everyone to chip in. This could include chore charts, cleaning supplies for everyone, or divvying up the workload.

4. Make sure that your approach is consistent and fair. Make sure everyone is held to the same standards and that you enforce the same rules for everyone.

5. Make it fun! Incorporate games, rewards, and incentives to keep everyone motivated.

6. Lead by example. Show your kids and wife that you are committed to cleaning up after yourselves as well. This will set a good example and foster a sense of cooperation among everyone."
217,How do you do your readings without falling asleep?,Have you tried reading out loud? Or getting a pen that you scan over the writing that reads it to you?,"

If you find yourself struggling to stay focused during readings, try setting realistic reading goals. Begin by setting a timer for yourself to measure how long you can concentrate on a certain section of material. Break down the material into smaller portions, and take breaks in between each one. If you find that you are getting too sleepy, get up and take a short walk around the room or even outside. Additionally, try making notes or highlighting important points as you read, so that you can look back at them later. Finally, talk to someone about the material you are reading—discussing what you are learning can help keep you engaged and awake."
218,What’s with the recent influx of people flying Mexican flags?,"Mexican independence Day is fast approaching.

Mexican heritage month just kicked off this past Friday and will continue until 10/15/2023.","

The recent influx of people flying Mexican flags is likely due to the pride that Mexicans have for their culture, history, and nation. This is especially the case in light of the increasing animosity towards Mexicans and other Latinx immigrants in the United States. Flying Mexican flags is seen as a way of expressing solidarity and standing together as a community in the face of racism and discrimination."
219,Is Reddit Considered “Mainstream Social Media” Now?,It basically is yeah. Media has been farming Reddit for content for the better part of a decade.,"

Yes, Reddit is now considered mainstream social media. Although it started off as a platform largely centered around discussion and community building, the platform has since grown to become a major media platform and has earned the interest of major corporations, investors, and advertisers."
220,Why does my computer/phone act like crap immediately after a new update comes out?,Planned obsolescence,"

This could be because the new update requires more processing power or memory than your device has, or because the update has inadvertently caused a bug or glitch somewhere which is causing your device to malfunction. If this happens, it's usually best to wait for the next update to come out which may help fix the issue."
221,Why does the joker give different stories about his scars in The Dark Knight?,"Hi /u/Infinite_Ride_2724,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

The Joker gives different stories about his scars for two primary reasons. First, it is a way for him to maintain an air of mystery and intrigue. By offering different and sometimes contradictory stories, he keeps audiences guessing and adds to the mythos of his character. Secondly, it works as a metaphor for the idea that there are multiple interpretations of truth and reality - everyone has their own story that they tell."
222,Do American students need to remember the names and locations of 50 states?," I did have to learn all 50 states and their capitals in 4th or 5th grade. Can still point out any state and name most capitals. From this thread I gather it is not the norm, but I went to a normal public school in the midwest.","

Yes, most American students are expected to be able to name all 50 states and their locations."
223,Is it weird to raise your child in a religion that you’re not part of?,I think it would be dishonest not to at least let your child know you don't believe in those things,"

Yes, it could be considered weird to raise your child in a religion that you’re not part of. This could lead to confusion and misunderstanding, as the child might not understand why you are not following the same faith as them. If you decide to do this, it is important to ensure that you discuss the decision openly and honestly with your child so that they understand why you are making this choice."
224,"How do I find local classes on things like cooking, dance etc in my area?","What country, what state? If US, look into community College","

The best way to find local classes on cooking, dance, and other activities in your area is to search online for classes offered in your city. Start by using a search engine to look for offerings in your local area and then narrow your search using specific keywords, such as ""cooking classes,"" ""dance classes,"" etc. Additionally, you may be able to find local classes or events by searching social media sites like Facebook and Meetup, or by searching review sites like Yelp. Finally, don't forget to ask around; many local classes are advertised in newspapers, on bulletin boards in the local community, or from word of mouth."
225,Is it rude to spend 3+ hours studying in a restaurant/café?,"It's probably not a problem as long as the place isn't super busy, and it helps if you're spending money. You could casually ask one of the nicer waitresses if there's any problem with staying a few hours just to be sure though.","

It depends on the restaurant or café. Some places may not mind if customers spend hours studying while others may prefer you to purchase something more frequently or not stay for so long. Whenever possible, try to be considerate of other customers and be mindful that you are using valuable seating space."
226,Why have they started putting these plastic benches in the men’s room?,Please tell me you tried sitting on it,"

The plastic benches in the men's room are there to provide a place for men to sit while putting on their shoes. This is seen as an important element of hygiene in the restroom, as it keeps the floor clean and free of clothes and debris. It also encourages men to leave the restroom quickly after using the facilities, reducing congestion and wait times for other patrons."
227,"Why does my cat clean/groom herself in front of me? Sometimes near my face, what is she implying?","She feels safe around you and is cleaning herself, as cats do, for hours a day.","

Your cat is likely trying to communicate with you in a comfortable, nonviolent way. Cats can use grooming to carry out important communication with their owners - it might be a sign that she's feeling relaxed and contented, or is seeking your attention or attention. It could also be a sign of trust and affection. In any case, it's likely that she views you as a valued part of her family and trusts you to understand her messages."
228,I think this girl thinks I am following her to her car. How can I convey that I am not a threat?,"You can just talk to her when you turn in your stuff. ""Hey, I'm in lot B, so I'm not following you if that's where you're headed too.""

I'd honestly be worried that taking a different route to end up at the same place is even more suspicious than taking the direct route.","

The best way to convey that you are not a threat is to give her space and to smile or to wave in a friendly manner. It may also be helpful to offer an explanation for why you are in the vicinity of her car. For example, you could say something like, ""I hope I'm not making you feel uncomfortable - I was just heading to my own car, which is parked nearby."""
229,What’s the point of revolution when we’ll always live in a society where a small number own all the country’s wealth?,"That sounds like a loaded question. Not every society has a massive wealth divide. Countries like Norway, Belgium or Iceland have low Gini indexes, meaning that the rich and poor are not nearly as far from each other as countries like South Africa or Brazil. 

A revolution could lower this gap, if that was the goal.","

The point of revolution is to challenge the distribution of power and resources in our society. It is also to secure freedom, justice, and equality for all citizens. Revolution is necessary to challenge outdated, oppressive systems and to redefine the way society views what counts as “wealth”. It is necessary for people to struggle for a fair, equitable, and sustainable society that works for everyone, not just the privileged few."
230,What are the odds of getting a prion from eating beef?,"Pretty low, unless you’re eating undercooked brain or something. Beef is widely consumed by many people and prion disease is rare.","

The odds of getting a prion from eating beef are extremely low. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no evidence to date that meat from cattle with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) poses any risk to human health. As such, the WHO states that the risk of contracting a prion disease from consuming beef is “extremely low”."

The City of London's skyscrapers are strangely shaped due to a series of restrictions on height and design. The City’s ancient streets mean the tallest buildings must often be shoehorned into tight sites, resulting in oddly-shaped structures. The City of London's ""tall buildings"" policy also means that the structures must have a distinct shape that minimizes their visual impact on the surrounding area. This typically requires zig-zag designs, which can be seen in many City of London skyscrapers."

No, the fee is only used to cover the cost of having the car towed and stored. You would still need to work with the towing company or local law enforcement agency to resolve the issue of the car's ownership."
234,Why is tattooing a word/name above the eyebrow seen as an entry level face tattoo by those with them?,"It's a current fad that will pass. People will look back at the ""name/word above the eyebrow"" fad like they currently do on fratboy tribals and tramp stamps. Which is why it's never a good idea to participate in ""current fad"" tattoo trends.","

Tattooing a word or name above the eyebrow is often seen as an entry level face tattoo because it is not too showy or noticeable and because it can be easily covered up, for example with a hoodie or hat. This makes it a popular choice for those who want to get a facial tattoo, but don't want to commit to something too bold or permanent right away. It also makes it an attractive choice for those who are unsure about their commitment to the tattoo idea, as it can be removed relatively easily when compared to more dramatic tattoos."
235,Can I get a dog for 1 month? How does fostering a dog work?,"You... I mean, if you legitimately want to foster a dog, talk to local foster organisations. They usually need more people to help. If they think you're a good candidate, they will train you and provide food etc.

With that said, the way you phrased this is probably not something that sounds appropriate.","

Most dog rescue organizations prefer that their animals are adopted rather than fostered. Taking a dog into your home even just for a month can be a big commitment of time and resources. However, you can look into week-long fostering programs where the rescue organization will drop off the canine and allow you to take care of and bond with the pup for a week or two.

If you choose to foster an animal from a rescue organization, they will generally require that you complete an adoption application, provide proof of an enclosed yard and be willing to sign a foster care contract."
236,Why do store alarm still went on even though all item are already paid?,Whoever was checking you out probably didn't deactivate the security tag properly.,"

Store alarms may still go off after items are paid for if there is still an active security tag attached to the item that has not been deactivated. This prevents customers from inadvertently taking items out of the store without paying for them."
237,Are Americans really stupid when it comes to Geography,"Americans aren’t a monolith.  There are plenty of Americans that know all there is to know about geography, and plenty that know nothing about geography.  Most are somewhere in the middle","?

No, Americans are not stupid when it comes to geography. Despite what may appear to be low scores on standardized tests and maps, Americans are still learning important geographical concepts, and many are interested in and passionate about geography and the world around them."
238,Had anything ever had a sharper rise and fall than sea shanties during that one week of COVID?,Tiger King,"

It is difficult to quantify and compare the sharp rise and fall of different trends with accuracy over a period of time. However, the rise and fall of sea shanties during the pandemic does seem to be one of the most drastic and quick changes in modern times. The term ""sea shanties"" was trending worldwide on social media in late 2020, when people found solace in large group singing gatherings held online. The trend reached its peak during the week of July 6th 2020, when people were looking for morale-boosting activities as the pandemic started to take its toll. By July 10th, however, the trend had begun to dwindle. The suddenness of the jump in popularity and the decline back to obscurity, in just a matter of days, makes the sea shanty trend one of the most drastic rises and falls in popularity in modern times."
239,Am I being scammed,"I have never sold medical equipment and cannot confirm that it is a scam, but I wouldn't give a complete stranger a photo of my license. Why not offer just a headshot for identification? My radar has gone off for this, and I have very good intuition!","?

It is impossible to answer this question without knowing more information about your situation. If you believe that you are being scammed, you should take action right away and contact the authorities in your area."
240,"When do you, as a male, lose the ability to “shoot”","So far, the answer isn’t 44"," sperm?

Most males lose the ability to produce sperm during old age, typically around the mid-60s. However, fertility rates can vary significantly from individual to individual, even at a young age, so it may be the case that some men never lose this ability."
241,"Women, is it a red flag if a man has a condom with him when he goes on a date?","Nah, I think it’s actually really smart. So many dudes would go out just looking to hookup and then get to say “I don’t have a condom” half way through. I think it’s considerate and pretty normal for your 20s","

No, it does not have to be a red flag. In fact, it can be viewed as a sign of being responsible and prepared. Depending on the type of date and your individual comfort level, it could be a sign that the man is looking for something more than just a platonic evening. That being said, it is always important to communicate your expectations openly before engaging in any activity."
242,Do certain breeds of dogs have retractable claws?,Took about 1 second to find this on the google https://labradoodlehome.com/do-dogs-have-retractable-claws/,"

No, most breeds of dogs do not have retractable claws. However, some rare breeds, such as the Catahoula Leopard Dog, do have semi-retractable claws."
243,Anyone know of a good female hair growth supplement? Should I take a natural shot blocker with biotin and zinc ect and or pre-natal vitamin or both?,"You should see a dermatologist. There are multiple causes of hair loss and even though you suspect it's stress, there could be something medical going on like a vitamin deficiency or hormone imbalance. The doctor would determine the cause and give appropriate treatment specific to your loss.","

There are several popular supplements available for hair growth, however, before trying any supplement, it's best to consult with a doctor to make sure that it is a safe and effective choice for your particular needs and health profile. Biotin and zinc are two commonly recommended hair-growth supplements, along with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamins C and D. Some people also take pre-natal vitamins in order to support hair growth, as they contain beneficial hair-growth nutrients such as iron, folic acid, and biotin. It's important to speak with your doctor before combining any supplements, as there can be contraindications depending on your individual health status."
244,Have anyone noticed how some subreddits seems to shadow hide posts and messages w/o ever noticing the poster?,Silent censorship. Funnily enough something most of Reddit seems to be against.,"

Yes, this happens in some subreddits. Moderators and rules of specific subreddits have the ability to delete posts and comments for any reason that they see fit. This could be because the posts or comments are considered inappropriate, offensive, or against the rules. Some subreddits can be quite strict about the content they want to be posted, so it's not uncommon for posts or comments to be hidden without the original poster ever knowing."
245,How do I stretch my tongue to make it longer?,"*clears throat*

On behalf of everyone here: Why do you want to make your tongue longer?","

Unfortunately, it is not possible to stretch your tongue and make it longer. Tongue length and size are largely determined by genetics and cannot be changed."
246,Why does my face look incredibly asymmetrical when I use my front facing camera?,"Photographs show your face as others see it, not flipped as you're used to seeing it in the mirror.  Some front facing cameras do reverse,  writing on t-shirts being reversed in some selfies is a giveaway sign of this.  Yours sounds like its showing it as others would see it.

The asymmetry is the same (and normal, most faces are not perfectly symmetrical).  You're just used to the asymmetry being a certain way around and seeing it the other way around makes it obvious.

Edit: A camera you're holding yourself is also likely to be closer than you'd stand to a mirror.  The perspective of a close view can also be unflattering (portrait photographers tend to use a longer lens and stand further away for this reason).  That might also be contributing to you noticing things more.","

The front-facing camera on your phone utilizes wide-angle lenses, which can cause distortion and asymmetry in a close-up image. The distortion can exaggerate the differences between the left and right side of your face, making it look more asymmetrical than it actually is."
247,How do I stop sleepwalking and eating?,A locked or blocked door will probably do the trick,"

Sleepwalking and sleep eating (also known as sleep-related eating disorder or SRED) are behaviors that can be difficult to stop without medical guidance. Consult your doctor if you are concerned about the safety associated with these behaviors. In the meantime, there are some lifestyle changes you can make that can help reduce sleepwalking and eating episodes. 

- Establish a regular, restful sleep schedule. You should aim for 8 hours of quality sleep a night.
- Avoid caffeine, large meals, and alcohol in the late evening and at night.
- Exercise regularly during the day, but avoid exercise 3-4 hours before bedtime. 
- Keep your bedroom comfortable, dark, and relaxing.
- Make your bed as soon as you wake up.
- If you experience an episode of sleepwalking or eating, talk to your doctor about getting a sleep study done to determine potential causes. 
- If you’re prescribed medication for sleepwalking and/or eating, make sure to take it as directed."
248,Would it be weird for me (M28) to see an Olivia Rodrigo concert by myself?,No. I went to the Taylor Swift concert recently and the people next to me were solo too. Normal. Enjoy yourself!,"

No, it wouldn't be weird for you to see an Olivia Rodrigo concert by yourself. In fact, it can be a great way to connect with the music without any distractions and fully immerse yourself in the experience. "
249,Reptilians? Trying to learn.,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_conspiracy_theory might help, or it may just mean us old people are wrinkly","

Reptilians are a type of mythical creature believed by some to exist in the universe, described as having reptilian features or characteristics. They are often said to shape-shift and sometimes are purported to have supernatural powers. Many conspiracy theorists and UFO enthusiasts believe they are also behind many of the unexplained phenomena in our world and beyond."
250,Is it normal to just have 3-4 friends?,"Yes, yes it's totally normal","

Yes, it is normal to have 3-4 friends. It is not necessary to have a large group of friends to have a meaningful social life. Different people enjoy different kinds of social activities and some people prefer to have a few close friendships instead of many acquaintances."
251,how to date someone/be seen as a romantic option with women,Seems like you need to start flirting and/or open up about deeper subjects.,"

1. Respect boundaries: Make sure you treat a woman with respect and don’t push her to do things she doesn’t feel comfortable with.

2. Listen: Show that you value what she has to say and pay attention when she speaks.

3. Compliments: Show her that you appreciate and value her.

4. Spend quality time together: Spend time with her doing activities she enjoys and getting to know each other.

5. Open up: Let her in and share things about yourself.

6. Have fun together: Laugh together and be yourself.

7. Be patient: Don’t expect too much from her too soon. Take your time and be open to getting to know each other gradually."
252,How did people develop different accents in other countries?,Same way you developed your accent.,"

People develop different accents in other countries due to a combination of historical, political, and cultural influences. Accents are shaped by the type of language spoken in particular regions, local dialects, various linguistic innovations, language contact between different cultures, and even migratory and urbanization patterns. As people migrate from one region to another, different accents are also created, making each region’s accent distinct from other areas."
253,How do I make effective notes?,"Predict/ anticipate what sort of questions will come up regarding the materials. Ask: How will they test me on this stuff?

Essays/ long answers: reduce materials to # of reasons/ factors for X.

Rote memorization: flashcards. The Anki program/ app is great for this. Creating the cards themselves is a form of studying.","

1. Start by gathering all of the materials you’ll need for taking notes, including pen and paper or a laptop.

2. Become familiar with the material before taking notes. Take time to read the text, rewatch the lecture, or listen to the podcast thoroughly.

3. Divide the page into sections, depending on the type of material you’re taking notes on.

4. Write down only important points, forming a summary or main points of the material. Avoid writing down too much information or details.

5. Use abbreviations, symbols, and visuals like diagrams or flow charts to keep your notes organized and easier to review.

6. Always add a date and reference information to each note such as the name of the book, lecture, or class.

7. After you finish, read back through your notes to make sure you understand them and that your key points match the material."
254,"Every couple years they find Levi denim in abandoned mines, and they sell for crazy amounts of money. Are they pulling these off 140yr old bodies? Or did guys just decide to Donald Duck it one day after digging?","Jeans used to be overwear, in fact they used to be marketed as “waist-high over-alls.” You wore them over your nicer pants. It’s not that odd to leave clothing meant solely for protection or covering your clothes, like an apron or a smock, at work.","

No, Levi jeans are not being pulled off the bodies of 140 year old miners. Most of the Levi jeans from abandoned mines have been preserved due to unique environmental conditions, such as dry climate, low humidity, and no light. The combination of these conditions have helped to keep the denim in its original condition. Some pairs of Levi jeans discovered in these mines have been dated back to the late 1800’s and early 1900’s, but many have been preserved so well that they look as if they were just made."
255,What is a film and TV unit police officer?,"Hi /u/Designer-Composer931,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

A film and TV unit police officer is an officer who works within a designated police unit that is responsible for providing policing services to the film and television industry. The role involves providing advice and consultation services on police procedures, coordinating the acquisition of filming permits, dealing with public complaints about filming locations, providing security services on film sets and assisting in the filming and production of television and film productions."
256,How do animals know to look us in the eye?,"I think every tetrapod probably understands how to recognize the eyes of another tetrapod: it's a matter of life and death to know if a predator is looking at you or not.

I think predators like dogs and cats might have a more complicated system of communication because their forward-facing eyes make turning to focus on you a much clearer message.

Being aware that another creature can see as you see and remember as you remember (as opposed to simply using eyes to communicate/instinctively percieving eye contact as a threat or botched hunt) is a higher level of intellect, part of ""theory of mind"". I think scientists were surprised to find that crows have this, for example: they will hide food in front of one crow and run back to the hiding spot if they see that specific crow return, because ""he saw, he knows"".","

Animals don't necessarily have the capacity to look people in the eye as a result of any deep understanding. Rather, many animals look into humans' eyes because they instinctively recognize the importance of the movement of eyes as a means of communication. Even if animals don't understand the meaning of the eye contact, they nonetheless recognize that it is a sign that the human is important and active."
257,Why do people thank their boss/company?,Do you want to keep your job? Lie or don’t 😭😭,"

People thank their boss or company for many reasons, such as recognizing their contributions to the success of the organization, thanking them for taking a chance and giving them the opportunity to succeed, thanking them for being supportive and understanding, and recognizing their leadership and mentorship. Generally, expressing gratitude is a way of showing appreciation and recognition for the support given."
258,"Is this text really ""cringe""?",You need smarter friends. You did absolutely nothing wrong.,"

No, it's not."
259,What's the evolutionary purpose of preferring foods with certain textures?,There isn't. Evolution isn't some perfect process where every aspect of a living being fits in perfectly. Adaptions that were made to solve one problem end up being applicable to others.,"

The evolutionary purpose of preferring certain textures in foods is believed to be related to safety. Smooth, soft textures may be preferred as an evolutionary adaptation to avoid foods with hard, crunchy textures which may potentially contain more dangerous parasites or contaminants. Additionally, individuals may have developed an instinctive preference for textures associated with more palatable items and those that are easier to digest."
260,How do I extract texts?,"Hi /u/Flashy-Window-5213,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

It depends on the format of the text you are trying to extract. For example, you may need to use a specific software for extracting text from an image or a PDF file. If you are looking to extract text from a web page or document, you can use a text scraping tool or browser plugin."
261,How often are you suppose to get a Pap smear?,Annually.,"

The recommended frequency of Pap smears varies by age and medical history. Generally, Pap smears are recommended every three years for women aged 21 to 65, but may be more often in certain cases. It is always best to discuss your individual Pap smear frequency with your healthcare provider."
262,"Why is it common for Redditors to say ""I don't mean to x but..""",It’s a very common practice in real life as well. It’s used to try and save face or preemptively defend themselves when they want to do or say something they know will be perceived negatively. If they truly didn’t expect someone to take offense at what they’re saying they wouldn’t have said “ I don’t mean to ___” in the first place,"

This phrase is commonly used by Redditors to preface their statements with the understanding that their opinion is just an opinion, and not intended to be offensive or hurtful. By acknowledging the potential for offense before giving an opinion, Redditors are courteously trying to ensure that their opinion is received in the spirit of conversation rather than as an insult."
263,Is it possible to get ripped without the diet dedication?,"Depends on what you mean by putting on some muscle. If you just want to be “in decent shape”, you have to pay some attention to your diet, but not necessarily your full focus. If you want to be absolutely ripped, yes you have to optimise your diet, well you have optimise almost every aspect of your life around that goal. 

If by protein complementary food, you mean protein bars and shakes, the bars get really expensive, and the shakes you can make by yourself could be relatively cheap, but ultimately it’s best to get your protein from less processed sources like chicken breast, if you can. 

If you are skinny, you do have to eat enough to bulk up. But if you are just looking to be reasonably toned with a bit of muscle, it shouldn’t be necessary to strictly count your calories and count your every macronutrient, and you don’t need to go to the extremes of eating 3000 calories with 150g of protein or anything huge like that. 

If you are a beginner to weightlifting, you can build some level of muscle relatively easy and quickly before you hit a plateau. Follow a simple lifting routine like the stronglifts 5x5 plan, do it 3x a week, eat a bit more than your usual and try to focus on protein sources. You can use a scale to monitor if you are slowly gaining weight. If you want to progress beyond that and get even more muscular, then you can consider from then on. But the best thing to do is to get started and get yourself used to a routine, after that you can decide whether to become even more dedicated and make it even more complex. 

People in prison still get muscular, even for those who can’t count calories and macros and can’t eat whatever they want. Manual laborers in developing nations are lean-muscular. One of my friends works out and is quite muscular, and what he eats is just whatever is food leftover at the bar at the end of shift (he works as a bartender). Sure, I think he has lucky genetics and genetics help, but you can make it work.","

No, it is not possible to get ripped without dietary dedication. Eating a nutritious diet that provides your body with the necessary fuel it needs to build muscle and burn fat is essential to getting ripped. Additionally, proper nutrition can help to provide your body with the energy and nutrients it needs to stay healthy and reach your fitness goals."
264,Is it normal to use your mom's facebook account to check out her friends,No…," list

No, it is not normal to use your mom's Facebook account to check out her friends list. It should be considered a breach of privacy and would be disrespectful to your mother. If you want to know who your mom is friends with, you should politely ask her to show you her list or to share it with you if she is comfortable with it."
265,I want to turn off this thing that shows fps and gpu usage but idk what program is doing this. What's it called?,Looks like its the overlay from Riva Tuner Statistics Server which may be installed by itself or packaged along with MSI Afterburner.,"

It is likely that you are using an application such as MSI Afterburner or EVGA Precision to monitor your FPS and GPU Usage. To turn it off you can open the application and disable the monitoring option."
266,Are judges just being petty?,"Ever heard of [Ariel Castro?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Castro_kidnappings) He was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison. That's ridiculous, right? Nobody could possibly live that long! But it turns out that even a sentence like that is actually pretty reasonable.

Those super long sentences are actually the result of *multiple* crimes being added together. Castro's thousand-year sentence is actually the result of **937** counts of kidnapping, rape and aggravated murder. When you add up the punishment for all those crimes, you may instead wonder why he wasn't given a *longer* sentence!

There's a good reason why courts do it this way - three, actually. First, it's part of giving justice to victims. The victim of the crime and their families deserve to know that the offender is getting punished for what they did to *them*, whether or not they are already getting punished for a different crime they committed. Secondly, it prevents the criminal from getting released if they are able to overturn *one* of their sentences on appeal. And thirdly, it can help keep that person in prison! In many countries, a life sentence isn't actually for life - it could mean a set number of years (25 or 15), or it could come with the possibility of parole after some time has passed. In other countries, someone must serve a percentage of their full sentence before they are eligible for parole (one third of their sentence in Canada, for example) or before they are moved from prison to house arrest (two-thirds of their sentence in Minnesota, for example). If someone has a sentence of 200 years, then even one-third of that is going to be long enough that it won't matter much to survivors.","

No, judges are typically not being petty when they make decisions on legal matters. They must apply the law and consider the particular circumstances of each case before making a decision."
267,is it true that you can’t love anyone if you don’t love yourself? and why?,What is more true is you can't accept or truly experience anyone else's love for you if you don't love yourself,"

Yes, it is true that you can’t love anyone if you don’t love yourself. Self-love is essential in order to be able to share genuine, healthy love with others. People who don’t love themselves can take on unhealthy, codependent relationships which negate true love and feed off of insecurity. Loving yourself is necessary for healthy relationships with others, as it allows you to trust and respect yourself and your emotions, and maintain your sense of individual identity and autonomy."
268,Are pets slaves?,I think I am a slave to my pet,"

No, pets are not slaves. Pets are beloved companions who provide us with love, friendship, and affection."
269,How has my eyesight improved?,"Yep, happened to my dad although he was a couple decades older at the time.","

There is no simple answer to this question since there are a variety of factors that can affect eyesight. In some cases, if vision correction such as glasses or contact lenses is being used, your eyesight may improve due to the corrective intervention. If you have a vision problem, such as nearsightedness or farsightedness, it may be possible to improve your eyesight through vision therapy exercises or surgery. Even if you don't have a vision problem, keeping your eyes healthy and using good vision hygiene can help improve vision and reduce further vision decline over time."

Fishermen who do not catch and release very large fish may eat the entire thing by themselves by either cutting it up into smaller portions, either at the lake or in their home kitchen, or pre-cooking it and then storing it in the refrigerator, freezer, or simply by eating it fresh. Many prepare stews, chowders, fish tacos, or sandwiches with the fish they have caught. They can also can or preserve the fish they have caught, so they can enjoy the taste long after the fishing trip has ended."

Houses typically do not have urinals because they usually require more plumbing work than toilets. They also require the installation of a separate wall unit, which can be expensive. Additionally, most homes do not have enough space to accommodate a urinal. Furthermore, the necessity for a urinal is often unnecessary in a home setting."
272,How often do you touch yourself?,"Well, some part of my body is usually in contact with another part of my body, so pretty much 24/7.

That is a very personal question and answered differently by everyone."
273,Tyramine content in decaf vs regular coffee?,"Ask your oncologist, it's what they're for","

The tyramine content in decaf coffee is much lower than in regular coffee. Decaffeinated coffee typically contains much lower levels of tyramine than regular coffee, ranging between 0 and 10 milligrams per kilogram, compared to 10 to 270 milligrams per kilogram in regular coffee."

Yes, eggs with double yolks will also have double whites."
275,Why do humans find cats cute but not bugs?,"I do find bugs cute, personally.","

Humans find cats cute because they have many of the characteristics that humans find attractive, including big eyes, a fuzzy coat, and expressive faces. Bugs, on the other hand, are often seen as creepy or frightening, and don’t generally display any of the qualities that make cats so appealing."
276,Is a want to experience prostrate orgasms make me gay?,"No, you should choose your preferred position, and if you like having an orgasm while lying stretched out with your face towards the floor that's completely fine.","

No, being interested in erotic pleasure of any kind does not make someone gay. Prostate orgasms can be experienced by anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation."
277,Why is it wrong for someone with a girlfriend/boyfriend to go out to drink with friends?,"The actual red flag is people who don’t want their partners going out with friends. You either trust them to not cheat on you, or you should just break up. This was more common in high school with guys who were insecure and/or jealous and manipulative. But it’s even more of a red flag to not have grown out of this thought process by adulthood.","

It is not necessarily wrong for someone with a girlfriend/boyfriend to go out to drink with friends, but it is important to be aware of potential implications. Depending on the type of relationship, there could be issues about trust and faithfulness. If the individual and their partner do not have open and honest communication about the activity, it could lead to feelings of betrayal or insecurity, which could damage the relationship."
278,"Is it The Jones', The Joneses, or The Jones's","If their name is Jones, then Jones' is the singular possessive. That would be saying ""this is the place owned by a Jones"". The plural possessive would be Joneses'. If they wanted to say ""There are a lot of people named Jones here"", then that would be the plural, which would be Joneses. 

Given that they started with ""The"", I suspect they wanted the possessive, and probably the plural, so it should probably be Joneses'.","

Full-screen smartphones and iPhones are already available. Popular devices such as the iPhone X, Apple's iPhoneXs, Samsung's S9, and other manufacturers offer full-screen designs. The feature gives users more real estate on the screen, creating a device that can offer more immersive experiences and enhanced designs."
280,Is QAnon still a thing?,"One of its more notable promoters, Jim Caviezel, stars on the film Sound of Freedom, which is alleged to have QAnon ties. But it has quieted down significantly as many followers have grown disillusioned after many failed predictions, and other promoters have either backtracked or kept silent on their support due to legal troubles.","

Yes, QAnon is still active, though its followers are slowly declining. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy theory alleging that President Donald Trump is waging a war against a worldwide, powerful network of pedophiles and Satan-worshippers. The conspiracy theory is largely based on anonymous messages posted on the internet by someone claiming to be a high-ranking government official code-named “Q”."
281,Can my school access my history through my email?,No. Email accounts don’t have access to search history.,"

No, generally speaking, schools will not be able to access an individual's email history unless the student has granted explicit permission to do so. However, each school's policy may vary, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the specific rules of your school."
282,question abt STD's and pregnancy,IVF.,"

Can a pregnant woman get an STD?

Yes, pregnant women can get STDs. Without treatment, some STDs, such as HIV and syphilis, can have serious health risks for a pregnant woman and her baby. That is why it’s important for pregnant women to get tested regularly for STDs. If a pregnant woman has any risk factors for a potential STD, they should talk to their doctor about getting tested."
283,What are your thoughts on the Marc Jacobs tote bag?,"It's over priced designer tat that isn't good for anything except impressing people who aren't worth impressing.

On top of that, I think it's pretty tacky looking.","

I think the Marc Jacobs tote bag is stylish, modern, and versatile. It's a great choice for anyone looking for a fashionable and practical bag to carry their necessities. It's the perfect balance between style and function for those who want to make a statement."
284,Am I the idiot for feeling frustration/anger for my partner traveling to another country for a few days?,"You're not an idiot, but something you'll understand more with time and experience is that it's good and healthy for partners in a relationship to take time for themselves. You are still individual people and you don't need to (and shouldn't) do every single thing together. It doesn't sound like you're worried about her cheating or anything like that while she's away -- just that you're feeling left out. It's also not like she's going for months; she'll only be gone for a few days. Your partner is communicating clearly with you and it's up to you to decide if what she's offering is something you can live with. 

If you want to be included on one of these trips in the future, you could suggest that. You don't have to come on every single one, but maybe it would be nice to do once or twice. But for now, it's important to recognize that your partner hasn't done anything wrong and is allowed to have aspects of her life that don't involve you.","

No, you are not an idiot for feeling this way. Everyone is entitled to their own feelings and opinions. It is important to recognize and accept how you are feeling and communicate with your partner about why you are feeling the way you do. Ultimately it may help to remember that it’s refreshing for couples to travel and explore new destinations together, but it’s also ok to take a break from one another every now and then."
285,Where does the light in the sun comes from?,When two atoms are fused together it's so energetic that a photon is created.,"

The light in the sun comes from nuclear fusion reactions taking place in its core. These reactions convert hydrogen into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of light, heat, and other radiation."
286,How did the idea get started that a tip you give is based on the total price of the bill?,As opposed to what? Keeping track of how many times they've had to walk back and forth to every single table the entire evening?,"

The idea of a tip being based on the total price of the bill is originally thought to have developed from the 17th century custom of giving a small sum of money as a gesture of appreciation for services rendered. Initially, this gesture was given to servants and bartenders in exchange for their services, and later became an expected part of any hospitality provided. In the early 20th century, tipping became more established and widely accepted as part of the dining culture, and it has since become customary for diners to tip servers based on a percentage of the total bill."
287,"Whenever I hear Republicans in smaller counties say they want to secede away from big cities, the democrats always counter that if they did, they would have no money bc the cities have all/most of the money. Is this true and how?","Big cities have large populations which means more employees, more businesses, more people buying things, more events and entertainment. There are more things to do in general and more opportunities, so people with money are often more attracted to those areas.","

No, it is not true. The truth is that many states, counties, and cities rely heavily on the federal government for revenue and economic aid. For example, many rural areas receive economic aid through the Department of Agriculture or state-funded programs like Medicaid. Therefore, even if a rural county were to secede, they would still be reliant on the federal government to some extent. Additionally, cities often have larger tax bases than rural areas, providing them with more revenue that is used to fund needed projects within the city."
288,How is Steven Seagal’s movie career a thing?,His movies were entertaining enough that people would go see them. Note that entertaining doesn't mean they're good movies.,"

Steven Seagal has been a major part of the action movie industry since the late 1980s, when he starred in the 1988 movie Above The Law. Since then, Seagal has appeared in dozens of feature films, including Under Siege (1992), On Deadly Ground (1994), and Exit Wounds (2001). Seagal's career is unique in that he is known for playing action heroes in direct-to-video films as well as in the major Hollywood productions. Seagal has also branched out into other genres, such as comedy (Down to the Bone, 2004), drama (Machete, 2010), and science fiction (End of a Gun, 2016). His most recent movie, the 2019 action thriller Kart ff, stars Seagal as an ex-military man who turns to a life of crime to support his family. Although his career has had its ups and downs, Seagal remains a major figure in the action genre."
289,I have personal-training homework and the person I'm training isn't following my schedule. How can I get them to follow it?,Are you not able to talk about your difficulties in getting them to follow it? Seems like that would be a common problem in personal training and worth discussing on its own in the paper?,"

It can be difficult to motivate someone to stick to their exercise schedule, but there are some steps you can take. 

1. Make sure you are creating a schedule that is realistic and tailored for them. Take into account their level of fitness, their commitments and other factors that will affect their ability to follow through. 

2. Set clear goals and expectations and discuss why it’s important to stay on track.

3. Offer incentives such as rewards for meeting certain targets or commemorative gifts for milestones achieved.

4. Keep in contact with them consistently in order to ensure that they have the support they need.

5. Hold them accountable by following up on progress. Regularly check in with them about their workouts and be honest about any areas where further effort is needed.

6. Celebrate their successes and progress, no matter how small.

Good luck!"
290,Android boxes,Android TV box?  Be careful - those things are apparently frequently infested with malware.,"

Android boxes are streaming devices that run on the Android operating system and are used to give access to online streaming services, video or music streaming, and other apps or services. The boxes are often connected to a TV or internet network and allow you to watch movies, TV shows, and other multimedia content on a large screen. Some of the most popular streaming services that can be accessed through an Android box include Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and Kodi."
291,Anyone else ever forget whether a memory actually happened or if it was just a dream?,"Yes, all the time","

Yes, all the time! It can be easy to confuse a dream or fantasy with an actual memory, especially if the details are blurry. It’s important to pause and reflect on the events leading up to the memory in order to gain a better understanding of what actually occurred."
292,Is it normal to keep waking up horny?,My sex drive has peaks and troughs to be honest. I’ll go for months or not thinking about it then have a few weeks of just having to choke the gecko 3/4 times a day until dust is coming out,"

Although some people do wake up feeling aroused, it is not necessarily considered normal. Generally, sexual arousal is something that differs from person to person, and there may be many reasons behind it. Psychological and physical factors as well as life stressors and hormones can all be contributors to your arousal. If the feeling persists and is causing disruption to your daily life it could be worthwhile to speak to your healthcare provider."
293,Currently getting inquiries for table service at a high-end nightclub. They always want to know what the occasion is? Will it make a difference what my answer will be?,"Yes, weddings will cost more.","

Yes, it can make a difference. Depending on the type of occasion you are celebrating, the club may offer discounts, exclusive areas, or other special services. For example, if you are celebrating a birthday, the club may offer a free bottle of champagne as part of the package and waive the cover charge. If you are hosting an event, the club might be able to provide a more intimate area for your group. Knowing what the occasion is helps the club understand how to best customize the experience for your group."
294,Question about Affirm loan payment option.,"Affirm may offer a lower interest rate than a credit card, assuming you make all payments on time.

Depending on card, carrying any balance in a credit card month to month will subject any carried balance, and possibly new charges as well, to interest charges at an APR of 20% or more.

Even for my main credit card, it's ""plan it"" BNPL feature still charges over 1% fees per month.","

Yes, you can pay your Affirm loan using a variety of payment methods. You can pay your loan online through your Affirm account using either bank account, debit card, or credit card. You can also set up autopay to have your payments deducted directly from your account. Additionally, you can mail in a check or money order if you prefer."
295,Why do we get so attached to one person?,"Love is like a physical drug, when you are a team with someone you love you feel so much more confident and powerful, and having been loved leaves a mark just like parents love does","

We tend to get so attached to one person because of the emotional bond that we create with them. We feel close to them and have feelings of trust and security. We value the person for their time, energy, care, and support. Attachment is a natural process in which we form an emotional connection with another and it helps us to learn and grow emotionally."
296,How do I (17M) tell my therapist that one of my only stress relief methods is bad?,"Therapists are there to handle your thoughts my guy, honesty is key if you want to improve. They won’t judge, most have heard much worse.","

It can be difficult to open up to your therapist about something that you don't feel is healthy or beneficial for you. The best way to approach the conversation is to be honest, upfront, and vulnerable. Taking a step back and assessing why you have chosen a certain stress relief method and if it is really helping you to manage your stress in a positive way is the first step. Once you have evaluated this, you can share it with your therapist. Acknowledge that while the activity may feel like a relief in the moment, it is not ultimately beneficial to your wellbeing. Ask for their help and support in finding alternative, healthy coping methods."
297,Is the fact that we can see things in space millions of lightyears away proof that things have been around for millions of years?,That's the gist of it. Yeah.,"

No, the fact that we can see things in space millions of light-years away does not prove that those things have been around for millions of years. Light from distant stars and galaxies has been travelling for millions of years, so we are seeing them as they were in the distant past, but that does not mean that things have been around for that long. It is possible that the objects we are seeing in the distant past may have since expired or been destroyed."

Yes, the radiation from a devastating nuclear attack could potentially ruin both countries. The radiation would spread across both territories, damaging the environment, and potentially causing health problems for survivors in both countries. It could also cause economic and infrastructural damage that would take time to recover from."
299,What was the word for someone who subscribes to an idea or a belief that automatically makes anyone who doesn’t share it the bad guy and any form of criticism is shut down as them being “corrupted”?,"I don't know that there is a specific word for an individual. Maybe dogmatic or closeminded. More generally especially in politics you will sometimes hear the concept of a ""purity test"" which is getting at the idea that one needs to have a certain level of adherance to an idea to really be considered a true member.","

No, women generally do not glance at crotches in a sexual or flirtatious manner."
301,What to do when called the N word,"Yo. Don't listen to most of these people. You can tell a lot of them aren't black.

Just be calm, don't show that you're upset.


You have to record them saying it.


 Bring it to a teacher and your parents. Usually being called the n word is a big deal even with administration. And if administration doesn't react to you being called the n word, you escalate it much higher. In most cases administration would protect their reputation than a racist student.

Also if you want to be petty, just casually refer to them as racist. Whenever you see them. 

People hate being referred to as racist (even if they are) because it strongly implies a character deficit.","

When called the N-word, it is important to respond in a way that is safe and respectful. The best response may depend on the situation and the relationship between the parties involved. If possible, it is best to calmly explain why the language is offensive and suggest more respectful language or no language at all. If the person does not respect this boundary, it may be best to remove oneself or the person from the situation."
302,Why do some people say I'm physically ugly even though I'm thin and well-groomed?,"Hi /u/InfluenceDry7454,

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub.

Unfortunately, some people can be quite judgmental when it comes to physical appearance. It is natural to want to be considered attractive by others, but ultimately your physical beauty should not define you or your self-worth. Every individual is unique and should be appreciated for their own individual characteristics and qualities, which you undoubtedly possess."
303,"Are all porn sites, porn content and porn makers the same?",There‘s market leaders and niche sites like in any online industry.,"

No. Different porn sites have different types of content and different porn makers have different levels of experience and expertise. Different types of pornography may be more or less accessible depending on the site you're visiting. Some sites may feature only amateur footage, while other sites may include professional, high-quality content. Additionally, some sites may focus exclusively on certain types of content, such as videos featuring footage of couples, solo performers, group sex, fetishes, etc."
304,"The bank accidentally deposits £10m into your account for 5 hours, is there anyway to financially gain before they take it back?","You can spend it all on scratch tickets and turn £10m into £1m. 

I used to work at a gas station and people would sell their house to buy scratch tickets. But, the more you play, the closer you get to the odds.","

It is highly unlikely that you would be able to gain any financial gain from the mistaken deposit of £10m into your account if the bank discovers the error within 5 hours.  Financial regulations generally require banks to alert customers if an unauthorised transaction occurs, and the funds would likely be reversed in a timely fashion. Your best option would be to contact the bank directly to discuss the error and your options going forward."
305,Do you have a screen protector on your iPhone or do you let it stay uncovered trusting the durability and scratch resistance of the screen?,"I think it helps somewhat, if only for peace of mind","

I use a screen protector on my iPhone. Even though the iPhone screen is designed to be able to withstand scratches, I like peace of mind that a screen protector can provide."
306,Why do some songs not list every artist that’s featured in the song title?,"It just depends on what deal they made with the label or artists involved, often it doesn’t show in the title but does show in the metadata","

Songs may not list every artist that's featured in the song title because the songwriters or producers or record label want to prioritize the main artist and give them the most attention. This is also done to simplify song titles and make them more catchy or memorable."
307,"Need advise on what we could do about a landlord who has breached our contract, and lied?","for the noise, you can check your local city/town and see if they have a noise ordinance. some places have an ordinance in place where you need to be quiet and respectful during certain hours of the night/morning.

this [article](https://nchh.org/2017/04/ensuring-an-asthma-safe-home/) goes over some options tenants have to get this resolved. 

good luck!","

The first step is to consult an attorney or the local rent control board (if applicable) to understand and review your rights and responsibilities as tenants under your lease or rental agreement. If your lease or rental agreement was breached, you may have a cause of action against your landlord and be entitled to damages. Additionally, if a landlord has lied or misrepresented the terms of a lease or rental agreement, you may have a cause of action against them for misrepresentation or fraud. Depending on the facts and circumstances of your situation, you may be able to leverage these causes of action to reach a resolution that is mutually beneficial for all parties involved."
308,Why is it still twitter?,Because rebranding a company and its flagship (only?) product is a massive undertaking that requires incomparably more planning than a new CEO jumping in and renaming it.,"

Twitter is still the same social media platform because its user-friendly interface and efficient design have allowed it to maintain its popularity over the years. People enjoy the quick, succinct format of Twitter posts, as well as the ability to easily connect with others. Despite the introduction of various other social media platforms, Twitter has still managed to remain a popular service."
309,Are people more selfish today than they were 20 years ago?,"For large groups of people, the average amount of selfishness is mostly determined by trust in others. In a low-trust environment, the opposite of selfishness is gullibility.

People now are more selfish/less gullible than twenty years ago when it comes to their professional life. They are more willing to screw over their employers/employees/business partners and exploit the system to get money. This is because authorities have regularly exploited people's trust in them.

People now are less selfish/more kind than twenty years ago when it comes to their personal life. They are more willing to go out of their way to make others feel comfortable and to understand their point of view. This is because of cultural progress and effort to bring mutual understanding across groups.","

This question is difficult to answer definitively since it cannot be answered with a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" Selfishness is a subjective concept that may be interpreted differently depending on personal values and beliefs. Factors such as technological advances, changes in social norms and public discourse, and growing disparities in wealth are likely to have contributed to changes in the prevalence of selfish behavior over the past two decades, but this is difficult to measure."
310,Can billionaires actually solve world problems?,"It's a bit more complicated than that. If they could somehow use their money to those ends with a guarantee that it goes to to right cause, then yes. That's a big if though.","

Yes, billionaires can use their wealth and influence to help solve world problems. They can fund research and programs, pursue public policy that helps tackle big issues, and invest in high-impact organizations working to address global concerns. They can also support social initiatives, campaigns, and foundations dedicated to alleviating the effects of poverty, hunger, and other issues existing around the world."
311,Keeping Green Onions Perpetually?,"This is called ""gardening,"" and it's easier to do in dirt.

What you're describing is hydroponic gardening.  Green onions / scallions are plants which are hydroponic-compatible.

It's a bit more involved than just dissolving fertilizer in the water, but yes, it is viable to do something similar to what you're wanting to do.  

​Google hydroponic scallions for many, many pages with information on how to successfully grow them hydroponically.","

If you want to keep your green onions around for a while, you can cut the ends off and place them in a glass of water on the windowsill. Place the roots in the water and leave the fatter part of the onion poking out. Change the water every few days and your green onions should stay fresh for weeks."
312,What is the most wasteful dish of an expensive ingredient?,"Does lobster have that much flavor though? The few times I’ve had it, it just seemed like a vehicle for the butter and seasoning.  I had it in Maine too.","

The most wasteful dish of an expensive ingredient would be something like Lobster Thermidor – an expensive dish that is made with lobster as the main ingredient, combined with cheese, butter and other decadent ingredients."
313,"If you could choose who will be your partner, who could it be?","I think Ill pick your wife too, she sounds great.","

That's a tough question! It really depends on what kind of partnership I'm looking for and what type of skills, experience, and qualifications the other person has. Ultimately, I would want someone who shares my values and is passionate about achieving our common goals."
314,Feeling late for masters degree,"Plenty of people go to school when they're much older than that. You're never too old to learn. I know several people who were in their 50s when they decided to make career changes.

Absolutely nobody will give a shit about your age. Do your thing.","

It is never too late to pursue a master's degree. Community colleges and many universities provide flexible learning options to allow working adults to complete a master's degree program around their busy schedules. There are also accelerated online programs that can help you finish a master's degree even faster. Depending on your current employment and educational background, you could begin earning your master's degree as soon as this year.

I have had the same issue with trying to get off Facebook. What I eventually did was delete the app from my phone, then delete my account after I removed everything I had. This way, I wasn't tempted to log back in. I also took steps to limit my usage of technology, like deleting other social media apps, reducing my screen time and introducing more activities that don't rely on technology. It was definitely challenging, but once I did it and saw the positive effects, it was worth it."

That is something that only you can decide. What is important is that you are looking for a relationship based on mutual respect, trust, and communication. If these are your expectations, then you are likely setting yourself up for a positive experience. Think about what qualities you are looking for in a potential partner, and use those to guide your decision."
317,What are those little rings below bottle caps for?,"They keep the bottle cap attached prior to purchase.  If the ring is longer attached to the cap at time of purchase, you know it has been opened/tampered with.","

The little rings below bottle caps are called pry-off crowns, and they are used to help open the bottle. When the pry-off crown is loosened, it provides a fulcrum point so that the bottle opener can slide beneath the lip of the bottle cap to open the bottle."
318,"Can you construct a sentence which confuses the words ""equate"" and ""equivocate"" but still makes sense ?","I don't think you can in an actually gramatical sentenc because equate is a transitive verb (requires an object) and equivocate is an intransitive verb (doesn't require an object).

This means the stuctuee of the sentences will be different. You can equivocate. Or you can ""equivocate on/between A and B""

Equate on the other hand requires an object. So you equate A and B.

Fundamentally yhe sentence structure is different for the two words because of that.

Now, that doesn't mean you couldn't squeeze out an informal, non gramatical but still comprehensible sentence.","

She equivocated on the issue, but in the end decided to simply equate the two sides."
319,Is it just me or is every 3rd person autistic these days?,"Autism is more understood, and diagnosis/support more available nowadays, which is why more people are able to learn that they're autistic.","

320,How do I remove a spark plug that’s really stuck.,Drown it in some wd-40. Also what are you using that your tool bent?,"

1. Use a spark plug socket and ratchet to try and loosen the spark plug. If this doesn’t work, you can try using anti-seize lubricant on the spark plug.

2. If this still doesn’t work you can try using an air wrench to try and get some leverage.

3. If all else fails you can try to use a spark plug extractor. This tool fits inside the spark plug and when turned it creates huge force that can break the spark plug loose. Be sure to use caution when using this tool."
321,"On graph paper with binder holes, why do they print the red margin line on the wrong side?","The margin line is for the left side, not the hole side. We write left to write.","

The red margin line on graph paper is typically printed on the wrong side of the page in order to provide an additional layer of protection to the enclosed binder holes when inserted into a three-ring binder or other enclosed organizer. This prevents the binder holes from becoming bent or worn out due to excessively large amounts of repeated insertions into the binder, and prolongs the life of the paper and binder."
322,I have an 6 year old gaming laptop. should I buy a gaming PC or a next-gen console?,"If you want simplicity and console exclusives, then buy the console.

If you want access to thousands of games (including the free ones given away by Epic every Thursday), and the ability to mod some games to your liking (eg. Skyrim/Starfield/XCOM2 etc), then get a gaming PC.","

If you are looking to get the most out of your gaming experience then getting a gaming PC would be your best option. Gaming PCs offer more powerful hardware which provides a smoother performance, higher frame rates, and enhanced graphical capabilities. That being said, if you are primarily just looking to play the latest games then a next-gen console would be suitable. Ultimately the decision comes down to personal preference and the amount you are willing to spend."

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

No, you do not need a middle name. It is not legally required to have one on your official documents such as your driver's license or passport. If you choose to have one, it is a personal choice and can be anything you'd like. For example, it could be a family name or something meaningful to you."
324,Would you date someone who does onlyfans?,As long as I don’t have to go on camera.,"

No, I wouldn't."
325,Is the Universe deterministic?,No. There are random events that do not depend on an initial state.,"

No, the universe is not strictly deterministic. According to the laws of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of subatomic particles, the outcome of an event cannot always be predicted with certainty, due to the inherent uncertainty of its underlying components."
326,How fast could the United States defeat North Korea?,"Question: in this scenario, does the US care about the North Korean people at all, or is it just us vs. them to the death?","

It is impossible to accurately answer this question since so much depends on a variety of factors such as the military strategies employed, the strength and readiness of both sides, access to resources, the political support given to the mission, and many other variables. Ultimately, any conflict between the U.S. and North Korea would need to be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and agreement."
327,How many grams of vegetables for 1 portion of rice?,"Hi /u/Dangerous_Bug6790,

The amount of vegetables necessary for 1 portion of rice depends on the type and amount of vegetables used as well as the portion size of rice. A general guideline would be to use about 50-100 grams of vegetables per portion of rice."
328,What happened to movies?,You're being too cynical.  There have been many great movies to come out in the recent years.,"

Movies have continued to be made, however the industry is facing a declining audience due to streaming options. In addition, movie theaters have often been closed around the world due to increased restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This has led to fewer people going out to the theater and more people watching movies at home, on streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime."
329,I have this weird flowchart and i need to replicate it in canva. I don't even know it's name.,What's your question?,"

This kind of diagram is often referred to as a process map. It is essentially a flowchart that shows the order of tasks involved in a process.

Canva is an excellent tool for creating process maps. It allows you to easily create custom diagrams with simple drag-and-drop tools. You can also upload your own images or use stock photos to customize the graphics in your diagram. To get started, go to the Canva homepage and select the ""Diagrams"" option. Then, select ""Process Maps"" from the list of diagrams and start designing your process map. You can use the pre-loaded shapes, icons, and lines to create the map and customize it to your needs."
330,Is anyone other than scammers using Reddit chat?,"Yes, I use it to talk to people","

Yes, many people use Reddit chat for various reasons, including finding help with a certain topic, discussing topics with like-minded people, and meeting new people."
331,Can ulnar nerve syndrome cause arm swelling?,"From what I am reading, it could be the opposite. Arm swelling can narrow the nerve channels, and cause ulnar nerve compression. You may have cause and effect backwards.

In any case a doctor, not Reddit, is the answer.","

Yes, swelling in the arm can be one of the symptoms of ulnar nerve syndrome. Other symptoms of ulnar nerve syndrome include pain and numbness in the affected arm, weakness in the hand and fingers, and a sense of cold or heat."
332,Who are potentially going to be the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees?,"The incumbent running for another term, will usually be the nominee for their party, barring some unexpected event like something happens to him or he decides not to run again.   In which case, it might end up being Harris that runs.  

For the republican side where there’s a lot of people running, right now there’s a few front runners including trump, but there’s a lot that can happen between now and the republican national convention next year when they officially nominate their candidate.","

The Democratic nominee for president is expected to be former Vice President Joe Biden, while the Republican nominee is expected to be incumbent President Donald Trump."
333,Am I Better Off Staying Off Tic Tok?,"Neither have i, honestly think i have a lot more free time as a result","

That depends on what you're looking for and your personal preferences. Some people may find Tic Tok entertaining and suitable for their interests, while for others it may not suit them. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if Tic Tok is something you want to spend time on or not."
334,Do religious people actually believe in the god stuff?,"Certainly 😊 However I have known people with a ""fake it to you make it"" attitude, with uncertain faith, and they eventually come into full faith from their attempts, but not everyone.","

Yes, religious people do believe in the concept of god and its teachings. It is an integral part of many religions. Depending on the specific faith, different people will have different interpretations and understanding of god, but most religious people view god as a spiritual force that guides their lives and provides them with strength, direction, and comfort."
335,If you have rabies can't they just inject fluids since you can't drink water?,"IV hydration is an option, yes. But that wouldn't ultimately help - rabies patients die from inflammation of their brain, not from dehydration.","

No, this is not a viable treatment option for rabies. Injected fluids are not an effective way to prevent or combat the disease, and they cannot replace the need for medical care. Treatment for rabies typically includes vaccinations, pain medication, antibiotics, and sometimes antidotes. Unfortunately, once a person develops symptoms of rabies, it is generally too late to effectively treat the disease, and death will occur within days."
336,Why are India and China so populated compared to other countries if their size?,Usually it means there was a time having alot of children was the key to survival. In Chinas case it was that demon Mao's policies,"

India and China both have high birth rates and are relatively large countries compared to their neighbors, so their populations have grown very quickly. Additionally, high levels of economic growth and the adoption of modern technologies, such as improved medical care and sanitation, have allowed their populations to increase significantly over the past few decades. Furthermore, both countries have historically had a strong cultural preference for having large families, further contributing to their higher than average population densities."
337,"Has the world always been this way, or is it just bad now?","Through most of human history it was much, much worse.","

There is no single definitive answer to this question because different people and cultures around the world have different opinions and experiences. Some people may feel that the world has always been this way, while others may feel that it’s worse now than it’s ever been. Everyone’s opinion is valid and subjective, so there is no single answer to this question."
338,Meaning of Financial Entity,"Bank. Credit union, etc","

A financial entity is an organization or institution that offers financial services, such as banking, insurance, investing, and lending. Financial entities are typically subject to government regulation to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system. Examples of financial entities include banks, credit unions, savings and loans, and investment companies."
339,Is there a way to tell on the Internet Archive whether or not an unavailable book will eventually become available? One book I was reading now says it's only available to patrons with print disabilities. What do I do?,Join your local library. They may have it avaliable to read as an ebook or they can search for it in their network and reserve it for you.,"

Unfortunately, at this time, the Internet Archive does not provide any information to indicate when unavailble books will become available. Your best option is to contact the Internet Archive directly and ask them if they have any information on when the book may become available."
340,How many people actually live off instant ramen and spaghetti?,"those two foods specifically i don't know, but there are certainly lots and lots of low income people who have to struggle to get by.","

It is impossible to answer this question accurately since the figures vary drastically from region to region. There are likely many people who use instant ramen and spaghetti as a staple in their diets, but it is difficult to estimate just how many people that is."
341,What is a P-Co?,"Knowing Stephen King, it could be a local to the book’s slang Pepsi Cola.","

P-Co stands for ""Portsmouth Communications Office,"" which is the communications office of the City of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The office is responsible for managing communications, marketing, and public relations for the city."
342,Why are companies not more for social/welfare programmes?,"It all comes down to money. While many of the things you listed would be beneficial for the company itself in the long-run, profits rule the roost, unfortunately.","

There are a variety of reasons why companies may not be more involved in social/welfare programmes. Some of these include cost considerations, management reluctance to allocate resources to charitable initiatives, a lack of understanding of how social programmes can benefit the business, lack of adequate knowledge of available resources, and potential reputational risks associated with engaging in such activities. Additionally, some organisations may be wary of the potential for such initiatives to become politicized, leading to unwanted media attention. Finally, the returns on investment may not be immediate or tangible, making it difficult for companies to measure the success of such initiatives."
343,What’s so entertaining about sports to men?,"Getting upset to a point of breaking things is an anger problem not a sports problem 

To you actual question: it’s a getaway.  For the three hours I’m watching a football game, I’m in that world. I’m not thinking about work, or bills, or anything else.  I’m just enjoying the moment.  And so are the people around me.  Doesn’t matter our politics, our religions, our social status. For that time, we are all fans of that team, trying to boost them to victory.","

Sports are entertaining to men for a variety of reasons. For many, sports provide a great source of entertainment with their intense competition and fast-paced action. Watching the strategy, athleticism, and skill on display provides an exciting experience. Additionally, sports allow men to connect with their peers and share in their enthusiasm. Finally, for many men, sports serve as a way to hold on to an important part of their childhood and remain engaged and passionate about something they still love."
344,Help me find a video,"I have no idea, but i think you will have more luck on /r/tipofmytongue","

There are countless videos available online- you can find videos on virtually any topic.

345,How am I supposed to put effort into looking good when it already takes all my effort to simply shower and shave?,I don’t know the answer but I’m in the same boat. Hopefully someone has some good advice.,"

It's totally understandable to feel overwhelmed or even unmotivated when it comes to putting effort into looking good. The good news is that there are a few simple ways to make looking good easy and effortless. First of all, start small and focus on simple things like wearing clothes that make you feel good and taking time to groom yourself. Then, once you feel comfortable, add an accessory like a piece of jewelry or a scarf to spice up your look. Finally, don't forget to practice self-care to give yourself a boost in confidence. All of these little steps can go a long way in making looking good effortless and fun."
346,How do I make sure I enjoy this concert?,Depends on the consert really. What kind of music is it? Who is performing? And in which place?,"

1. Have the right mindset - come to the concert with an open mind, enthusiasm and a positive attitude.

2. Get familiar with the music - listen to the music and the artists performing ahead of time to get an idea of what you can expect from the show.

3. Get there early - arrive as close to the doors opening as possible so you have time to get settled before the show starts.

4. Take breaks - try to take breaks throughout the show so you don’t get too overwhelmed.

5. Talk to other fans - striking up a conversation with other concert-goers around you can make the experience even more enjoyable.

6. Appreciate the music - try to focus on the music and the atmosphere at the show, and let the music take you away."
347,"what is an idiom/proverb that's the opposite of ""the gift that keeps on giving""?",Just use that same one but sarcastically.,"

""A present that keeps on taking"""
348,Do people who want the British monarchy dissolved want each country to be its own independent entity? Or be under a more secular kind of rule?,"Those are 2 separate issues. Dissolving the monarchy would have no direct impact on how the UK is run, as the monarch does not in practice exert any power. Independence for the countries that are currently part of the UK would mean that they would make all decisions in their own parliaments, elected only by their own people, instead of being bound by decisions made by the UK parliament which is elected by all the people of the UK.","

People who want the British monarchy dissolved generally have different ideas about what should replace it. Some might want countries in the UK to become independent entities without any kind of rule by a monarchy. Others might prefer a more secular type of government such as a presidential republic or a parliamentary republic."
349,Women’s clothing sizing,"Sizing varies wildly based on manufacturer.  Honestly your best bet, if you're unwilling / unable to go to stores to try things on, is to find websites with a good return policy and just order a few different sizes of the same item and only keep the one that fits well.","

Women’s clothing usually runs from sizes 0-16, with sizes 0-2 falling into the “petite” category and sizes 14-16 being considered “plus-size”. Furthermore, women’s clothing is usually cut smaller around the waist, making it important to check the specific measurements of the item you are looking for to ensure a proper fit."
350,Why drugs in the USA seems so much stronger than in Europe ?,"No one posts videos of something boring.

I'm an American, and I went right back to my job after getting my wisdom teeth out. Handled a few emails and conference calls, then asked if I could check out a little early that day.

Nothing worthy of a video.","

Drugs in the USA may seem stronger than in Europe because of differences in production and distribution. In the US, drug production, trafficking, and importing is largely unregulated and conducted on a large scale. This means that drugs can pass through multiple hands and be mixed with other substances, which can lead to higher concentrations and more dangerous drugs. In Europe, however, drugs are typically tracked and regulated. This makes them more consistent in quality and strength."
351,Do any men actually find these ridiculously long salon done fingernails attractive?,"Personally, I find them absolutely hideous. But they aren't for me. They do it because they like it themselves.","

No, not all men find these long fingernails attractive. Different people are attracted to different things, and some men may find the look appealing while others may find it unattractive."
352,How do I stop “falling in love” with every stranger that shows me a tiny bit of kindness?,"Generally, people who do this have very poor self image, so they seek validation in others. If you can't learn to accept and validate yourself, you're going to keep seeking this in other people.","

This is a difficult question to answer because everyone has unique experiences and motivations for feeling the way they do. However, if you find yourself constantly associating feelings of love with strangers it might be helpful to focus on other factors in the person that you can appreciate. For example, it might be helpful to recognize the other persons' kindness, but also focus on things like their intelligence, sense of humor, or qualities that you admire about them. Additionally, it can be helpful to take inventory of the relationships in your life and focus more on those instead. This may also help you to distance yourself from developing romantic feelings for strangers. You can also practice self-care by doing activities that make you happy and focusing on what truly matters to you. Finally, if you find that you are still struggling, it may be helpful to seek help and support from a licensed mental health professional."
353,Whats something you give good advice on but you personally struggle with achieving?,"Helping people get over their worries.

Cannot do it to myself.","

I give good advice on time management and goal setting, but I personally struggle with having the self-discipline to stick to my own goals."
354,how do straight girls react when being asked out by lesbians ?,"I’m so flattered!!  I’m sorry, I’m not gay, but thank you.","

It depends on the individual. Some straight girls may be uncomfortable or even offended at being asked out, while others may be more open-minded and willing to give it a try. Ultimately, it's up to the girl to decide how she wishes to respond."
355,"why fight the other, rather than your own cheating partners?",If it's the affair partner's fault they don't have to feel like they failed in keeping their partner happy. And they can live in denial that it was a special circumstance with that particular AP and won't happen again.,"

It is not recommended to fight with your cheating partner. It is best to end the relationship and address the issue privately with a counselor or trusted friend. Fighting against a cheating partner is usually counterproductive and unhealthy for both parties. Alternatively, it is important to focus on self-care and healing following any relationship that has been damaged by an individual's unfaithfulness."
356,"Does anybody else feel that younger people now are more violent and/or abusive during sex, and why?","There's been plenty of kink sex everywhere in the lgbt community and in general the past century. The Internet and fewer social taboos just makes its much more accessible and visible now (which does increase its participants). 

But from my expeirance the vast majority of gay people aren't engaging in bdsm sex at all and if they do its very much bot the default. It's more likely confirmation bias as why would there be posts/conversation about ""normal"" more vanilla sex. its the norm.","

This is a difficult question to answer definitively, as there is no concrete evidence to suggest that younger people are more violent and/or abusive during sex than people of other ages. However, it is likely that younger people may engage in more risky behaviors during sex, either accidentally or intentionally, due to factors such as lack of experience, limited knowledge of consent, or being more susceptible to peer pressure. It is important to remember that each individual is unique and one cannot necessarily conclude that younger people are more violent and/or abusive during sex."
357,Am I Overreacting??!!,That's weird and unprofessional,"

No one can answer that question but you. It depends on the situation and how significant the thing is that is making you feel this way. Think about why it has upset you so much and try to take a few moments to consider the situation objectively. If you feel like your reaction falls within a normal range then you are probably not overreacting."
358,"Help, I jacked off on camera on the Internet and got scammed.","It’s not that hard to “fake send” these things and make it appear to you that he’s doing it.

From the scammer’s perspective: he doesn’t _want_ to send the videos of you because then he loses his leverage— once the video is sent he can’t ask you for more money.

So he will try to fake it to get you to pay a second time.

They will probably come back in a month or so to try again.

Same answer- block and ignore.

It was a mistake to send him money… but block and ignore is the best way to go and never ever ever do anything like this again. Ever.

If you want to do the naked chat thing- do it with someone you know and trust.","

We understand how stressful and upsetting this experience must be for you. Unfortunately, the scammer cannot be held responsible or charged with any crime. What you can do is take action to protect yourself and your online security. We recommend deleting all accounts associated with the scammer, changing any related passwords, and taking measures to secure your computer, like updating your anti-virus software and installing a secure VPN. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the signs of online scams and to practice online safety tips."
359,are women on average more attractive than men?,Most people are pretty fucking ugly (source stuck in an airport all day recently),"

No, attractiveness is subjective and cannot be determined by gender."
360,How to use up the last amount of money on a gift card?,it just gets used up and you gotta pay the remainder,"

1. Look for items on the gift card that are the lowest priced. 
2. Focus on small gifts that are easier to purchase for the full amount. 
3. Consider purchasing items in bulk to get more for the money. 
4. Look for specials or sales that can help get more for the money. 
5. Put the remaining balance towards a future purchase. 
6. Use the balance for online purchases if possible. 
7. Check to see if the gift card can be used at a local store. 
8. See if the store offers e-gift cards if the physical card is empty."
361,How do I stop media multitasking?,It’s playing on your dopamine receptors just like a slot machine. It’s your own reality you’re trying to escape. Why is it hard to stop playing video games and put the time instead towards learning a life fulfilling experience or skill? It’s about priorities and what you want.,"

To stop media multitasking, you can set limits on the amount of time you spend on various apps or websites, or set yourself a daily allotted time for multitasking. You can also adjust the notifications settings from social media so that you're not getting alerted every time someone posts and interrupts your focus. Additionally, try turning off push notifications on your phone to avoid excessive multitasking. Lastly, you can use apps such as Freedom or Flipd, which will block and limit access to certain apps you want to stop using."
362,Is their insurance that doesnt cover your car?,There is liability only insurance that doesn't cover your car but does cover any damage you do with it.,"

Yes, some auto insurance companies may not cover certain makes and models of cars. It is important to check with each insurer to find the most appropriate coverage for your vehicle."
363,Why are there not fuses on jumper cables?,Because the kind of person who doesnt know how to use jumper cable yet tries to do it themselves instead of paying for AAA isnt going to buy the fancy jumper cables with fuses.,"

Jumper cables do not need fuses because they are usually used to provide a temporary connection that doesn't carry current for very long. If a fuse was used, it would most likely blow every time the cables were used. Fuses typically work best in circuits that carry current continuously, such as items plugged into an electrical outlet or automotive wiring systems."
364,"How high is ""too high"" for a body count?","Seems like you should rephrase this question as, “should I stop telling my roommate literally everything so he can stop judging me & my dating life” you didn’t have a problem w it till your friend had a problem w it. Grow up, be more secure. 5 years till you’re 30. Don’t bring that energy w you.","

There is no single answer to this question, since ""too high"" is subjective. Different people have different opinions about the acceptable or acceptable range for a body count. Some may consider any body count to be too high, while others may be comfortable with a relatively high body count. Ultimately, the individual's opinion is the only one that matters."
365,Why do Americans order food delivery so much? Do you guys just not eat at the restaurants?,You have to drive everywhere in America. Food delivery is just paying someone else to drive for you.,"

There are many reasons why Americans order food delivery. Some of the common reasons include convenience, price (especially with the development of delivery apps like Uber Eats and Door Dash that often offer discounts or promotions), and the rise of more creative and unique delivery options (such as gourmet meals, baked goods, specialty meats, etc). Additionally, advances in technology have made ordering food delivery an easy and reliable process. So no, Americans do still eat at restaurants, but with the convenience of ordering food delivery, it is becoming a more popular option."
366,Can I use a thumbtack to remove a flat ingrown hair?,Sterilised needle would be safer.,"

No, you should not use a thumbtack to remove a flat ingrown hair. This could cause irritation or increase your risk of infection. Instead, use tweezers to gently pluck out the ingrown hair."
367,Why are the Boston Celtics pronounced with a soft C and not a hard one?,"Hi /u/cidkdkdkdjdjdu,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

The pronunciation of ""Celtics"" with a soft 'c' is a result of the French influence on the English language. In the original New England accent, the 'c' in ""Celtics"" was pronounced with a soft /s/ sound like ""seltics"", out of respect for the French etymology of the name."
368,Are cookies from random sites okay to have on your laptop?,Generally yea. You aren’t getting away from tracking.,"

It depends. If the cookie is from a trusted website, then it should be safe to have. However, it is not recommended to enable cookies from unknown, untrusted sites, as this could potentially lead to security issues."
369,"is there a specific name for the ethnicity with these facial features (prominent brow, really white skin)",Neanderthal,"

There is no specific ethnic name or term for the physical features you described. However, the facial features you listed are commonly described as ""Nordic"" or ""Scandinavian"" features."
370,Do they still make movie promo music videos?,[Watati - Karol G ft. Aldo Ranks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqG0GF_LA0Q) from Barbie,"

Yes, movie promo music videos are still being created today. Many popular songs have been featured in movie trailers and ads over the years, further promoting the film. Additionally, many movie studios and record labels are commissioning unique musical tributes for upcoming films."
371,Would distilled water clean you better in a bath and/or shower?,"No and if you ingest any, probably even if it gets in your eyes, it would hurt you","

Distilled water is not recommended for bathing or showering as it can strip away the oils from your skin, leaving it dry and irritated. Regular tap water should be used for bathing and showering as it has minerals that are beneficial for your skin."
372,Why are the Taliban and ISIS enemies?,Isis wants to build a worldwide caliphate. The Taliban wants an independent Afghanistan. The two has about as much in common as the American Tea party and the English Monarchy.,"

The Taliban and ISIS are enemies because their ideologies are fundamentally in opposition to one another. The Taliban adheres to a strict interpretation of Islamic law and seeks to impose it through Sharia law in Afghanistan, whereas ISIS claims to be a global caliphate and seeks to spread its form of hardline Islamic rule worldwide. ISIS has repeatedly attacked Taliban-controlled territories in Afghanistan and other parts of the region. As such, they are now clear enemies."
373,How do I remive flat i grown hairs?,[deleted],"

Unfortunately, there isn't an effective way to remove flat or grown-in hairs. The best course of action to prevent them is to use tweezers or another precision grooming tool to pluck the hairs when they are still emerging."
374,So jets getting caught in eachothers wash can destabilize the other plane and make them lose control. So how the hell does aerial refueling work?,The receiving aircraft stays out of the wake turbulence area of the tanker aircraft.," 

Aerial refueling works by transferring fuel safely between two planes while in flight. The aircraft receiving fuel does so through a refueling probe, which is extended from the front of the refueling aircraft. A hose and drogue system is then extended from the tanker aircraft, and connected to the receiver aircraft refueling probe. The tanker aircraft then initiates refueling, transferring fuel from the tanker to the receiver at pre-set rates and per agreed-to flying safety procedures. Both aircraft maintain a pre-set distance from each other, using the autopilot systems to help control the distance, and can adjust their relative speed in order to remain stable in the air while the refueling is in progress. Once the required fuel is transferred, the refueling probe is retracted and the hose and drogue system is retracted back into the tanker aircraft."
375,Why does stock market close at the weekend?,People want to take time of.,"

The stock market closes at the weekend because it is closed for regular trading hours, which are typically from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday through Friday, EST. Weekends and holidays are excluded from regular trading hours, but extended-hours trading may take place on those days. This allows traders to take some time off and prevents the market from being overexposed."

377,Why do my clothes not bleed colour in the wash?,youre color blind and have been wearing pink clothes for years,"

Your clothes do not bleed colour in the wash because most modern fabrics have been pre-treated with products that help prevent fading and colour loss. Many retailers offer fabrics with colourfast dyes that are designed to hold their colour even when repeatedly washed and dried. Additionally, cold-water washing and avoiding harsh detergents also helps to prevent colour loss in clothes."
378,How is the universe 93 billion lightyears in diameter?,"The expansion of spacetime is *accelerating*. It is accelerating in some places faster than the speed of light (the speed of light applies to *information* being transmitted through spacetime, not spacetime itself).","

The universe is 93 billion lightyears in diameter because it is constantly expanding. This means that the light that we are seeing from galaxies that are 93 billion lightyears away has taken 93 billion years to reach us. This means that the universe has expanded to at least that size in that amount of time."
379,How are you supposed to know about copyright law in advance?,Ignorance of the law is not an excuse to break it. You are expected to do your due diligence before engaging in activities.,"

The best way to know about copyright law in advance is to consult a copyright lawyer. They specialize in this area of law and can provide important information and advice. Additionally, the U.S. Copyright Office website has a wealth of information and resources for learning about copyright law. Additionally, it is important to stay abreast of any changes to copyright laws. There are many online resources available to do that."
380,"If you had your mouth sewn shut, could you eat via your nose?",You could put in a feeding tube yes,"

No, you would not be able to eat via your nose. Digestion begins in the mouth with chewing food to break it down for digestion."
381,Why does my head vibrate when near the microwave?,Id get a new microwave...,"

This phenomenon is known as the ""microwave auditory effect."" When electromagnetic radiation from the microwave oven is absorbed by human tissue, it can cause a vibrating sensation in the head or even a sound that can be heard. This phenomenon is harmless."
382,How to get to know people in new country?,Is there an equivalent to some kind of meetup or get-together site where there is a list of activities in the area where you can pick something that interests you? That way both you and the people going there have the same interests in at least that event.,"

1. Take a Language Class. Taking a language class is one of the best ways to get to know locals in a new country. Learning the language will give you a better sense of the culture, and immersing yourself in the class environment will introduce you to new people with shared interests. 

2. Attend Local Events. Look for local community events such as festivals, concerts, or sports events to meet new people and learn about the culture. Not only is this a great way to make friends, but it also provides entertainment and fun activities to participate in.

3. Explore Common Interests. Finding common interests can be a great way to bond with people from a different background. Use websites such as Meetup to find groups that share similar interests and hobbies. 

4. Join Co-working Spaces. Co-working spaces are great places to meet ambitious individuals and professionals. Working alongside other entrepreneurs and innovators can open up network and collaboration opportunities.

5. Volunteer. Volunteering is one of the most rewarding ways to meet locals, as you will be able to contribute to a cause that is meaningful to them. Participating in volunteer projects will help you develop your skillset while making a positive impact."
383,Is it normal for a girl to fall asleep every single time after masturbating?,Sounds normal to me. As long as it doesnt cause you significant issues I wouldnt worry about it.,"

It is normal for people to feel sleepy after masturbating as it is a form of sexual release and can be quite satisfying. However, if you feel like you are falling asleep after masturbating every single time, it could be a good idea to see a doctor and discuss ways to help you stay awake."
384,Do you really have to drink 64oz of water a day if you’re not doing anything?,"Not necessary.   The hydration craze is overestimated,  even some doctors think so.   Your brain will tell you when you need fluids ( it's been doing so for centuries!).  Some consciousness of fluid intake of course is good.  * Met a ,95 year old who never drank fluids while eating in order to allow stomach acid to do their work undiluted,!","

Although it is generally recommended to drink 64 ounces of water a day if you’re not doing anything particularly strenuous or active, it is not absolutely necessary. Your individual water needs may be different and may depend on your individual health, lifestyle, and environment. Therefore, it is best to speak to your doctor to determine an appropriate water intake for you."
385,"On Roblox, why do I always get banned within minutes for minor chat infractions, but other players don't despite acting worse?","Hi /u/bible-2,

386,How do mermaids have babies?,"Mermaids don't exsist, probably that's why they don't have be pregnant, it's fiction and the storyteller can make up as many mermaids as they would like to have in the story.  
And so they always be fine and beautiful.","

Mermaids do not have babies since they are mythical creatures. They only exist in literature, film, television, and folklore."
387,Dumb question please help....,27 as well. I “know” mine but I don’t have it memorized or anything. I have to look it up any time I need it,"

There are no dumb questions - the best way to get help is to ask! What would you like to know?"
388,Shoulder stretch marks,"Sometimes stretch marks are simply a genetic issue, but if you get them from working out it’s probably because you’re not moisturizing your skin properly. Working out releases cortisol (adrenaline hormone) and the release of cortisol lessens your skins natural elasticity. I would recommend moisturizing whatever area of the body your focusing on before you go to the gym- with an actual thick lotion or a body oil, not a moisturizing body wash or hand cream, etc. and of course, stay as hydrated as possible.","

Should stretch marks can be treated using laser treatments, such as fractional laser treatments, as well as topical creams and lotions that are specifically formulated to address stretch marks. Laser treatments can help diminish the appearance of stretch marks, while topical treatments can help to soothe and nourish the affected area. Additionally, it is best to use a daily moisturizer on the affected area to keep the skin hydrated and prevent further formation of stretch marks."
389,Any really really famous people on here?,My neighbors don't even know my name.,"

No, the Quora community is filled with everyday people who just want to ask and answer questions."
390,Should I hire a private investigator?,Maybe it could have something to do with the fact you don’t talk to them anymore? Not really sure how to help here tbh. Lol,"

If you feel that the information you need to discover is beyond your capabilities to find yourself, then a private investigator might be a good option to explore. They can provide a confidential and non-judgmental means of assistance. Depending on the type of information you are looking for, private investigators may also be able to provide access to records, resources, and services that you would not have access to on your own. Make sure to research the investigator and to ask many questions to ensure that you feel comfortable with this choice."
391,How many normal house cats do you think it would take to kill one fully grown male brown bear?,I think the bear would die of exhaustion before any number of cats managed to do anything to it. I don't think their claws or fangs could even get through a bear's fur and skin.,"

It would be impossible for one or even multiple house cats to kill a fully grown male brown bear. The bear would almost certainly be too large and powerful for the cats to do any real damage."
392,What do you think of #bantheADL trending on Twitter?,"Hi /u/Fantastic_Mud4395,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

I think that it is important to respect the right to free speech. However, I believe that no one should be allowed to use harassment or hate speech in any way, regardless of who or what the target is. The ADL is doing vital work in combatting racism and anti-Semitism, and we must all stand with them in their fight against hatred."
393,Do people who are into astrology try to get pregnant at a specific month so their child has a good star sign?,Some of them,"

This is not something that people actively seek to do; however, some people may seek to align the month of conception with their preferred zodiac sign to give the resulting child certain qualities or characteristics associated with that particular sign. Ultimately, this is a personal decision that is entirely up to the individual or couple."
394,What do you do when you feel an acid reflux in throat?,"First I take some Tums or similar, and then I check my med organizer to make sure my GERD medicine is where it's supposed to be.","

If you are feeling an acid reflux in your throat, the first thing you should do is avoid foods that are known to trigger it, such as caffeine, alcohol, fatty and spicy foods, and acidic foods. In addition, you should also try to reduce stress levels, avoid smoking, and practice better posture. Taking an antacid or an over the counter medication may provide relief as well. If the symptoms persist, it is best to speak to your doctor as soon as possible."
395,Dirty talk,Unique to the individual,"

Dirty talk is a type of dialogue or speech that is designed to create sexual arousal or excitement in one or both partners involved in intimate activities. Examples can include descriptions of activities or fantasies, expressions of pleasure and appreciation, or even requests and directives."
396,"This woman I started seeing, is amazing, funny, smart, sexy, she teaches ES. We are hooked on each other yada yada. But, I just found out yesterday she is a Trump fangirl. Lmao. I myself am a Centrist Democrat.",I wouldn't be with someone that votes against human rights,"

Well first of all, don't let her political views put a damper on your relationship! No one should let politics stand in the way of relationships. Instead, try to have open and honest conversations about your respective political views and try to find a middle ground that works best for both of you. Who knows, maybe you'll both learn something new from each other and gain a better understanding of different perspectives."
397,Why do so many people fetishize the soviet union and think they are the heroes of ww2?,Because the USSR took on 2/3 of the German military and inflicted 80% of their casualties.  That's just fact.,"

Many people fetishize the Soviet Union and view them as the heroes of World War II for a number of reasons. The first reason is the narrative of the Great Patriotic War that was propagated by the Soviet government. This narrative highlighted the great sacrifices made by the Russian people during the war, and the eventual victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany. It also emphasized the heroism of the Red Army, and the sense of national pride it instilled in Russians. Additionally, the accomplishments of Soviet science and technology during the war have made a big impression on people, such as the development of the atomic bomb and contributions made to the space race. Finally, the memory of the war has strong emotional resonance with many people, especially those from the countries that were liberated or occupied by the Red Army."
398,Are big eyes considered attractive?,"Yes, big eyes are considered one of the universal parameters of attraction","

Yes, many people find larger eyes to be quite attractive."
399,Should computers have tutorials?,"Microsoft puts familiar games on its computers as stealth tutorials. Solitaire teaches click and drag, etc. 

Personally, I get annoyed when there are extra screens or buttons in the way of what I'm trying to do and don't need or want a tutorial. I'm a developer and know the feature of windows/macos/Linux really well. WSL, powershell, terminal, env variables, etc. You can watch videos on YouTube if you want to learn more","

Yes, computers should have tutorials. Tutorials can help users become more efficient and comfortable using the computer. They also can provide instructions on how to use the computer to complete a variety of tasks, such as sending emails, creating documents, and other tasks."
400,"If we all cut down our consumption to half, would we all be able to work only half our time?","Considering that in the western world we throw away the majority of the food we produce, no","

No, cutting our consumption in half would not necessarily mean that we would be able to work only half our time. This is because our hours of work are largely determined by the availability and demand of jobs, as well as government policies. "
401,what do you think average person's understanding of emotional maturity/intelligence is?,Probably pretty average.,"

I think that the average person's understanding of emotional maturity and intelligence is that it involves having the ability to understand, manage, and express your emotions, as well as having the capacity to look beyond your own perspective and understand how your actions, words, and decisions affect other people. It also entails having the skills to effectively problem-solve and communicate with another person, manage emotions in difficult situations, and being self-aware enough to develop meaningful relationships."
402,"Why does water extinguish fire? There’s oxygen in water, and you can weld underwater. Some things even burn underwater.","There is very little oxygen carried by water. If you’re referring to the O part of H2O then that’s not available as it’s bound to hydrogen, in the same way that the hydrogen doesn’t ignite on contact with heat, as it’s bound to the oxygen."," All fuels require oxygen to maintain combustion, and the water splashed on the fire extinguishes it by taking away the oxygen supply that the fire needs to continue burning. Water can also help absorb some of the heat, essentially cooling the fuel below its ignition temperature and preventing combustion."
403,Life isn't good. What do I do?,Stoicism or absurdism,"

It depends on what is specifically not making life good. It could be helpful to identify that issue specifically, and then take steps to work through it. If you’re dealing with an underlying mental health issue such as depression or anxiety, ideally you would seek professional help from a therapist, psychiatrist or counselor. It could also be helpful to make positive lifestyle changes such as engaging in physical activity, connecting with supportive friends and family, eating healthy, and getting enough sleep. It can help to focus on your strengths and take steps to build a more positive lifestyle for yourself through activities that bring joy and purpose. Additionally, it is important to take care of basic needs such as enough food, shelter, and clothing so you can focus on addressing any other issues."
404,Can people who are incapable of creating mental images still develop schizophrenia?,"My oldest sister was diagnosed with both aphantasia, and schizophrenia. So, yes.","

Yes, people who are incapable of creating mental images can develop schizophrenia, although abnormal mental imagery and distorted thoughts can be among the symptoms of the disorder. People without the ability to create mental images may not necessarily exhibit the same auditory and visual hallucinations as those who can create mental images, but the illness may manifest in other ways, such as a loosening of logical connections or a decline in the ability to concentrate. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with several potential causes, and the disorder can affect anyone."
405,I’ve never had a headache. What does it feel like and has anyone else lacked this experience?,Imagine an ice pick and someone nailing it through your eye and then twisting it.,"

Headaches can feel like a dull ache or pressure in the head. They may also be accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light and noise, and difficulty concentrating. If you’ve never had a headache, then it is possible, but quite unlikely. Most people experience occasional headaches but it is possible to go through life without ever having one."
406,What's the most common second language taught in Australian schools?,"i’ll guess since it’s the nearest country, Bahasa Indonesia","

The most common second language taught in Australian schools is Japanese."
407,"Do construction workers get the same credit as engineers for bridges, dams, buildings, etc. not collapsing? Since they were the ones that built them?","They built them to specifications, so although they are skilled workers doing a difficult thing, the only reason the specific structure they built is stable is because it was properly designed.","

No, construction workers do not get the same credit as engineers for the success of buildings and other structures. Engineers and architects are responsible for determining the appropriate design and specifications for a project, and construction workers are responsible for building it exactly to those specifications. Building professionals such as construction workers are to be praised for properly and safely constructing large structures, but the project's overall success is usually attributed to the engineering design."
408,Anyone else stare in the mirror every chance they get?,My now husband did while we were dating and I almost didn't marry him becauae of it.  His mother had mirrors in every rom in their house After marriage the only mirrors were in the bathroom and bedroom.  He also started gaining weight which put a end to his vanity.,"

No, I do not."
409,Is it creepy to use images of somebody else and then say that it's you?,"Hi /u/One-Stock-9942,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

Yes, it is creepy to use images of somebody else and then say that it's you. Misrepresenting yourself in this way is dishonest and unethical."
410,if you get flashbanged is it like in videogames?,"Nothing like in games.

The explosion of magnesium-based pyrotechnic chemicals causes a very bright flash and a loud sound (160−180 decibels), which can cause temporary blindness, temporary loss of hearing and loss of balance, as well as a sense of panic. Parts of the device can burst and travel as shrapnel so you can get physically injured from the ojbect.","

It depends on the game. Generally, in most games, being flashbanged will result in a period of impaired vision and inability to use sights or scopes. However, some games may feature additional effects such as increased vulnerability to damage or movement impairments."
411,Do women find kindness in men attractive as a personality trait?,More like a bare minimum for most of us than something I'd call attractive.,"

Yes, many women find kindness in men attractive. This quality often shows a man's caring, understanding, and protective nature. It is seen as a positive personality trait, and it can give women comfort in knowing that the man is someone they can rely on."
412,How do you brush your teeth?,"My dentist tells me not to rinse with water after spitting, but I still do because it feels gross to leave toothpaste in there.","

1. Place your toothbrush at a 45° angle against your gum line.
2. Use small, circular strokes to brush the outer surfaces of your teeth and gums.
3. Brush gently in a back-and-forth motion on the inner surfaces of your teeth.
4. Brush your tongue from back to front and rinse your mouth.
5. Spit the toothpaste out and rinse your brush."
413,Dose all software gradually grow larger with updates?,Usually updates work by just tacking new stuff onto whats already there. So etkmes they might replace or remove things though. Depends on if they have a reason to do so.,"

No, not all software grows gradually larger with updates. Sometimes software updates can add features or improve performance in more efficient ways, leading to a decrease in overall size."
414,Am I going to get cold sore because my sister sneaked some of my drink?,"Maybe, maybe not.","

No, there is no risk of contracting a cold sore from drinking after your sister. Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus, but they are not contagious through everyday contact like sharing drinks."
415,Is it weird that I can’t bring myself to throw away things from my childhood?,"This is the start to hoarding. I’ve seen the show. 
Good luck, dear OP. One day you may find yourself trapped in what the very stuff you love so much.","

No, not at all. Many people are very sentimental about things from their childhood and find it difficult to part with them. You can try to be practical by keeping only the items you have an emotional or sentimental connection to and discarding the rest if that helps."
416,Do women really get angry at their partners over cheating in their dream?,"I've certainly had bad dreams where my husband said or did something to upset me (not usually involving cheating, mind you), and I've woken up feeling bad as a result. But even when I've just woken up and my brain hasn't come online yet, I know that I'm angry at my dream version of my husband, rather than the reality. And the things he does in my dreams are always wildly out of character for him. I'm able to separate dream from reality, and if I think there might be some holdover resentment I warn him in advance of my bad mood. 

Last week I had a dream where *I* did something to upset HIM, and woke up feeling worried that he would still be angry with me. 

Overall, though, no, I don't really get angry with him for what he does in my dreams.","

It is possible for a woman to experience anger in her dreams in relation to a partner cheating. However, dreams are typically symbolic and oftentimes represent a deep inner emotion or issue the dreamer is grappling with. Women who dream of their partner cheating may be examining their feelings of insecurity, fear, jealousy, and trust. Some women may be angry in their dreams as a result of these feelings, while others may experience other emotions. Generally speaking, no two dreams are the same, and the emotions and feelings associated with dreaming of a partner cheating can vary greatly from person to person."
417,Why do women find the sims games so interesting.,"Usually for the same reasons men do: Building a make believe perfect life, making wacky characters and scenerios, and torturing the sims we dont like.","

Women find the Sims games so interesting because the games offer a large amount of creative freedom and control. The nature of the game allows players to create their own virtual worlds and characters, and also craft their own stories. In addition, the Sims games offer a large degree of customization, which appeals to many players. Finally, the vibrant art style coupled with the quirky and humorous features within the game provide a captivating and entertaining experience."
418,Do air purifiers remove a lot of dust in the air?,This is the epitome of a first world problem,"

Yes, air purifiers can effectively remove dust from the air. This is done through a filter that captures dust particles as air passes through it. Many air purifiers also use technologies such as ionizers and UV light to help remove additional dust particles."

If served only soup at a dinner party for adults, I would politely express my confusion and ask if there would be any other items served. If I was told that there would not be any additional items, I would make a polite excuse to leave the party."
420,Is the time you sleep important if you get the recommended hours?,"No, I believe that these inconsistencies were intentional in caveman times since it meant some of us could stay up to watch the tribe while others slept

There’s nothing wrong with falling asleep past midnight","

Yes, the time you sleep is important for adequate physical and mental health. Studies have shown that getting the recommended 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night helps improve mood, focus, and energy levels, and can reduce the risk of medical issues such as obesity and diabetes."
421,Hypocrite or Justified?,"Hi /u/EfficientFisherman72,

Ultimately, this depends on the specific circumstances of each particular situation. Hypocrisy may be justified in certain contexts, such as when a person behaves with integrity in a way that is beneficial for others or that enables an individual to make changes in his or her life. Similarly, it may be justified when a person speaks out about something they disagree with and their behavior aligns with their beliefs. On the other hand, hypocrisy can be seen as unjustified when a person has a double standard or when they speak out against something but do not act in accordance with their beliefs."

423,I want to listen to David Bowie. Where should I start?,"David Bowie - The Best of Bowie (1980) should give you a good sampling

Some of my favorites:

Space oddity

ashes to ashes

Heroes 

Golden Years

China Girl

Modern Love

Blue Jean","

If you’re looking to start listening to David Bowie, it depends on your taste in music. If you’re looking for classic Bowie, start with his album “The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars”. If you’re looking for more contemporary Bowie, start with his most recent album “Blackstar”. Additionally, his greatest hits albums “Changesonebowie” and “Best of Bowie” provide a great overview of his music throughout the years."
424,how is a month calculated?,1st of the month to the 1st of the next month.,"

A month is typically calculated based on completing one full rotation around the sun, which takes approximately 365 and a quarter days. The length of one month is usually fixed at either 28, 30, or 31 days, depending on the specific month. In a month with 30 days, it would take 12 and a quarter cycles through all twelve months to add up to 365 days."
425,If you aren’t American and decided to visit the US what was/would be the first place(s) you’d go if you had two weeks? (I ask this as an American who loves to travel abroad so curious to hear what your answer would be),IDK about first but Yellowstone is a must IMO.,"

If I had two weeks to explore the United States I would definitely begin my trip in New York City. From iconic landmarks such as the Empire State Building, Times Square, and Central Park, to world-renowned dining experiences, there is simply so much to do and explore within the city. From there I would make my way toward the West Coast and explore the eclectic city of San Francisco. From the “painted ladies” of the famous row houses in Alamo Square Park to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, visiting San Francisco would give me an opportunity to experience a different part of the US. I would also plan on stopping in Los Angeles, an entertainment capital filled with celebrities, iconic movie studios, and beautiful beaches. To round out my trip I would visit Washington DC, taking in all the sights the nation’s capital has to offer. From the National Mall and the Smithsonian museums to the memorials of past presidents, I would love to explore the city and learn more about US history."
426,How long does it take for a freezer to make ice inside after being unplugged for like 2 days?,"Do you mean ice cubes from an ice maker?  For that, a water line needs to be connected to the fridge.  Is the water line correctly connected and turned on?  Are the settings for the icemaker turned on?  Have you checked the owner's manual for troubleshooting tips or information for how long it should take to make a tray of ice?  Have you searched google for these kinds of things to troubleshoot the problem?  Most ice machines should be making ice within the first 24 hours.  

Do you mean frost that develops on the sidewalls?  That shouldn't happen in newer freezers.  That also should take at least a month or two before it would need defrosted if it does build up ice.

A freezer that is unplugged will never make any kind of ice.","

It typically takes anywhere from 12 to 24 hours for an empty freezer to return to its proper temperature and begin making ice once it has been unplugged."
427,Temp to store canned tuna,"The storage temperature is a quality issue, and not a safety issue. If you're buying it and using it in a reasonable timeframe, you'll never notice anything. If you're stocking your TEOTWAWKI\* bunker, maybe rotate them out earlier than the best by date on the can.

\*TEOTWAWKI: **T**he **e**nd **o**f **t**he **w**orld **a**s **w**e **k**now **i**t.","

It is best to store canned tuna in a cool, dry place. This could be in a cupboard, pantry, or even in the refrigerator. If storing in the refrigerator, it is important to keep the lid firmly sealed as excess moisture can affect the taste and shelf life of the product."
428,Can I safely look at the full Sun using eclipse glasses?,"You’re generally not supposed to, but limited exposure should be fine. 

The glasses are really designed to look at the limited light from an eclipse, but not the brightness from the full sun. If they were darker so you could look at the sun, an eclipse would be harder to see.","

No. Eclipse glasses provide only enough protection for you to be able to observe during a partial or total solar eclipse. It is not safe to look directly at the Sun outside of an eclipse."
429,"Hardcore Christians only, no progressives. Is pegging still sodomy?","hardcore christians!! lol made me laugh

devout christians  yeah will call it sodomy","

The term sodomy is generally used as a legal term to refer to various sexual practices that are not considered part of traditional sexual intercourse. Because different religions have different definitions of what qualifies as sodomy, it's impossible to answer this question for all Hardcore Christians."
430,Is the writers strike really about AI?,"Studios are trying to get writers and actors to sign over their style and likeness. It's not that they'll be fully replaced by robots in the next couple of years, it's that the studio is trying to claim ownership of ""writing in the style of [writer X]"" so that it can hire a two-bit intern to feed prompts into the finetuned language model and clean up the output for a fraction of the cost that it takes to hire the writer themself. With actors, studios are trying to get high resolution scans of actors' faces that the studio is the legal owner of, so that the studio can use those scans in (AI-supported) CGI forever after. 

Right now, the studio's best attempts at this might need more time and money to make serviceable than hiring the actors and writers, but the studios are preparing for technology to improve further in the future by demanding now that writers and actors sign over as many of their defining features as lawyers think might stick.","

No, the writers' strike is not about AI. It is about writers wanting better wages, healthcare, and benefits in order to remain successful."
431,Is it illegal to own ivory,As long as your not trying to sell it your fine.,"

In the United States, it is generally illegal to buy, sell, or trade any ivory under state and federal laws, including import, export, and possession. A few exceptions may apply. Check with your local government for the most up-to-date information."
432,"Every year hundreds of thousands of people disappear without a trace and life goes on. But what happens if instead of common people, all the 2700 billionaires suddenly disappear?",They get replaced with new billionaires as people inherit the money.  The billionaires are just the symptom of a much broader problem.,"

If all 2700 billionaires disappeared suddenly without a trace, it would have a major economic impact on the world. The vanishing of such a large amount of wealth would cause an economic recession, as the lack of capital would lead to a decrease in investments and consumption, a fall in the stock market, and the bankruptcy of many businesses. With a decrease in capital, there would also be a decrease in job opportunities as businesses would not be able to hire as many people. On the other hand, there would be no shortage of essential goods due to the wealth gap between the wealthy and everyone else, the consumers would increase and the prices would go down. Finally, governments would have to take steps to prevent a financial crisis, such as new taxes, grants, or a stimulus package, in order to prevent economic turmoil."
433,Do you reckon Apple Music will ever be as popular as Spotify?,Only if Apple buys it.,"

It is difficult to predict how popular any streaming service will become. Whether Apple Music will ever overtake Spotify in popularity remains to be seen."
434,Is there actually a sound quality difference between Spotify and Apple Music?,"Apple has lossless.
Unsure if Spotify does but I’ve never used that hot garbage streaming service.","

Yes, there is, although the difference is likely to be subjective. Spotify is said to have better audio quality than Apple Music because their streaming bit rate is around 320 kbps, while Apple Music is 256 kbps. However, some people may not hear the difference or prefer the sound of one over the other."
435,Do all plants produce oxygen? Do they all make the air safe to breathe?,"To the first question, yes. Even plants that eat insects photosynthesize. This process releases oxygen. 

This doesn't exactly make air safe. Sarin gas doesn't affect plants. They will keep taking in CO2 and release oxygen. But if the room is full of sarin, you will die(or wish you were dead) and the plants keep chugging along.","

No, not all plants produce oxygen. Only plants that perform photosynthesis are able to produce oxygen. These plants utilize the energy from the sun to turn water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose. However, not all plants make the air safe to breathe. Some produce toxic substances such as ethylene, while others may produce allergens or equivalent compounds that can cause health problems in humans."
436,Is there anything we eat that doesn’t come from something living? (Not including liquids),Salt,"

Salt, sugar, spices, some processed foods (such as potato chips), and baking powder do not come from something living."
437,What’s that tasty looking thin red sauce I see people dip their tortillas in?,Usually its the leftover juices from stewed meat.,"

That is likely a sauce made from chile de arbol peppers, which is commonly referred to as salsa de arbol. It is a spicy, thin red sauce made with chile de arbol peppers, garlic, onion, and other spices. It is often used to dip corn and flour tortillas into, and is also popular for chilaquiles (a Mexican dish made with fried tortillas)."
438,Why is no one talking about Japan releasing nuclear water into the ocean?,"Because it's actually not a big deal. It's tritium, which is a hydrogen isotope that the ocean already has a bunch of naturally, and it will decay on its own in a decade or two.","

There has been a lot of discussion in the media, scientific community, and among various governments around the world about the potential environmental and health hazards associated with the discharge of contaminated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean. However, the topic has not received as much attention from the public as other environmental issues because there is still the scientific consensus that the release of contaminated water into the ocean will not pose any significant long-term risk to the environment or to human health."
439,Just realized I have no idea where my drivers license is and there's about 4 different bars and a concert venue that it could be at. How much is my identity at risk now?,Not any more than it was before.,"

Your identity is in slight risk as long as you act quickly and take the proper measures to protect your identity and data. Immediately report your license as lost or stolen to the DMV in your state and cancel any financial or other accounts associated with it, such as credit cards, if necessary. If you are worried about identity theft, you may also want to consider enrolling in an identity theft protection service and credit monitoring service."
440,Why do spouses have a rebound\person of physical attraction when they break things off with you? Would that be cheating since it’s during the relationship before breaking it off?,"Every healthy human should have a life that spreads beyond just their spouse/immediate family.     They should have friends, co workers, acquaintances already in their lives.   
If they have a balanced life, then many will even have others who are interested in them.   Because the married spouse is married, those other folks may not say anything.  They may hint about it, or they may come out and offer temptation.    The married spouse might ignore hints, and might shut down offers of temptation... while they are in their marriage.  

As soon as that relationship breaks down, there's less reasons for the former spouse to turn those advances down or ignore them.   They might also reach out themselves - they are capable of asking others out, too.   

They probably won't date assholes/manipulative bitches unless it's just for sex or to piss off the ex.    But they will have needs, and they probably will have the tools to fill those needs.","

The answer to this question can vary widely depending on the situation. In general, when a person is leaving a relationship, they may have the need to seek out physical comfort or validation of their attractiveness from someone else. This may be an attempt to soothe the pain and hurt of the breakup. 

In terms of whether this would be considered cheating, it depends on the unique circumstances of the relationship and the agreements the partners have made. If the partners agreed not to engage in intimate relationships with anyone else during their relationship, then it could potentially be considered cheating. Ultimately, only the partners can decide if it is cheating and they should discuss the matter openly and honestly."
441,What would you say is the #1 reason for most relationships not working out?,Shallow attraction. Just because two people think each other are hot doesnt mean they can get along.,"

Lack of communication and willingness to work on the relationship are the main reasons why most relationships don't work out. Without communication and effort, relationships can easily become stagnant or fall apart."
442,"Men with sisters, do you assume your sister's boyfriend/husband is a bad guy at first?","No, why would I do that?","

No, not necessarily. People usually form an opinion on someone based on their own experiences, and so a person's opinion of someone can't be assumed based on the fact that they have sisters."
443,how do i enter a romantic relationship in college,Join the LGBT club,"

1. Get to know people by attending campus events and joining student organizations. 
2. Identify people who are compatible with your values, interests, and life goals. 
3. Talk to people you find attractive and develop friendships with them over time. 
4. Demonstrate interest in the person by keeping in touch, making an effort to connect, and planning activities together. 
5. Respect boundaries and be honest about your feelings, especially if you would like to take the friendship to the next level. 
6. Ask the person out on a date and be prepared to take the relationship at a pace that is comfortable for both of you."
444,Anyone know how to set up record players?,"I'm old so I know the ways of vinyl...

But its hard not knowing what your setup is.

You have a receiver, turntable, and speakers?

You plug the RCA's in the phono jacks on the receiver and then into the ""out"" jacks on the turntable.  Then attach the speakers with speaker wire or banana plugs","

1. Set up the turntable on a level and stable surface.
2. Connect the turntable to the amplifier or speaker system using the appropriate cables.
3. Turn on the amplifier or speakers power switch.
4. Connect the ground wire from the turntable to the ground port on the amplifier or speakers.
5. Plug in the power cord to your turntable.
6. Place your vinyl record on the turntable.
7. Use the tonearm counterweight to find the tracking force.
8. Finally, start the turntable’s platter and the music should start to play."
445,I'm going for eyes test. How to choose a perfect frame?,u can always try for contacts if you’re really super against glasses ?,"

1. Consider the shape of your face. Different frame shapes will flatter various face shapes.
2. Think about the size of your frames. Generally, the frame should roughly be the width of your face or slightly wider.
3. Consider the color of your frames. Choose colors that will flatter your complexion and look best with your hair color.
4. Consider the material of your frames. Plastic or metal frames may offer different styles and should be selected to suit your needs.
5. Ask for advice from the optometrist. They will have a lot of experience and should be able to help you find the perfect frame for your face and eyesight needs."
446,"Ho do you respond to ""I've dated a black guy before. It's not for me.""","I dated, people are awful, can't honestly recommend it.","

That's okay--everyone is entitled to their own preferences and opinions. We all have our own individual experiences and backgrounds that shape our views, and it's important to respect that."
447,What is the point of being a good person?,"It makes me feel good to be a good person.

Being a shitty person would make me feel shitty.","

The point of being a good person is to create a positive impact on those around you and to make the world better for everyone. Good people bring joy, peace, love, and kindness to the world and model the kind of behavior that we all should strive to follow. Being a good person is not only about doing the right thing for others, but ultimately doing the right thing for yourself as well. Being a person of integrity and high moral standards can help to give life greater meaning and purpose, and bring a sense of satisfaction to one's own happiness."
448,"Straight men of reddit, why do you shave arms, legs, chest?","What’s being straight got to do with it?

Everyone’s body hair is different, some people don’t like the look of their body hair or the wider issues they may perceive it brings

No one cares whether you think it’s attractive or not","

I think it really depends on the individual and their own personal preference. I don’t personally shave outside of my face but there are a lot of people who do. I think part of it is for comfort and hygiene, but I’m sure some do it for the aesthetic look as well."
449,Explosive Diarrhea or Vomiting,"Vomiting is worse to me - acid reflux is rancid, i enjoy eating food and keeping things down, the constant brushing of teeth etc. is annoying 

Diarrhoea is easy to manage you just shit it out and I enjoy Pooing","/Diarrhea

If your pet is experiencing explosive diarrhea or vomiting/diarrhea, it is important to take them to your veterinarian as soon as possible. These symptoms may indicate a more serious underlying condition, such as an infection or parasite. Your veterinarian will be able to do some diagnostic tests, such as a fecal exam or blood tests, and determine the cause of the symptoms. Treatment depends on the underlying cause and may include fluids, antibiotics, anti-nausea medication, and dietary changes."
450,"If a human got grinded up, what colour would the substance be",Red cos blood,"?

Most likely a flesh-toned pinkish-red color."
451,"What does crazy, I was crazy once, mean?","Its from a poem that went viral forever ago:

    Crazy? I was crazy once.
    They put me in a room.
    A rubber room.
    A rubber room with rats.
    They put me in a rubber room with rubber rats.
    Rubber rats? I hate rubber rats.
    They make me crazy.
    Crazy? I was crazy once.
    They put me in a room….","

This phrase is often used in the context of someone talking about a time in their life when they experienced some kind of mental illness, often depression or anxiety. It often implies that the person has since gotten better and has a different perspective on their experience. It can signal a willingness to talk about and share their own experiences, in an attempt to help others who may be in a similar situation."
452,Helped my sister backup her phone to my computer...,"Hi /u/EconomistPersonal910,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us.

1. Connect your sister's phone to your computer using the appropriate cable (usually USB).

2. On your sister's phone, unlock the device and allow access to the computer by tapping ""Trust"".

3. Open the file manager on your computer and locate the connected device. It may be labeled as a ""removable device"" or an associated brand name, such as an iPhone.

4. Once the device is found, begin transferring files by selecting them and dragging them to the desired location on your computer.

5. After all of the data is backed up, disconnect the device from your computer."
453,Why do commercials advertise prescription medication?,"People may have chronic conditions, and the drug they've been taking for years kind of sucks.   But that's all there is, so they just get it refilled every 6-12 months.     Now, there's something new for that condition, so maybe it's worth asking about a change.   

People might have chronic conditions, and there was no drug - or the drug available just didn't work.  Now there's a new drug, so it's worth a doctor visit to ask about the new drug.   

People might not like going to doctors.  They have chronic conditions that they just deal with, because their parents and others they spoke to told them there was nothing to do.    Seeing a commercial might wake them up to the fact they might get treatment - so instead of just dealing, they visit a doctor and ask. 

These kinds of ads only happen in New Zealand and the US today.","

Prescription medications are heavily advertised so that people who are in need of the particular medication can become aware of it and so they can ask their doctor about it. These commercials also help increase the sales for the medication, leading to more money for the companies that produce them."
454,Does anyone feel like eating is a chore? How do you change this mentality?,"me! i do!

it’s just always SO inconvenient!","

Yes, some people do feel that eating is a chore. To change this mentality, focus on the positive aspects of eating. Eating can be a wonderful opportunity to enjoy a delicious meal and take a moment to pause and be mindful. Eating should be an enjoyable and relaxing experience. The best way to make it feel less like a chore is to take the time to find meals that you enjoy, plan ahead, and cook with ingredients that are beneficial for your health. Taking the time to prepare and savor your meals can help give you a sense of satisfaction and joy."
455,Did anyone ever take the fall for faking the evidence that caused USA and UK to invade Iraq?,Millions of Iraqis did,"

No, no one was ever found guilty of faking the evidence that caused the United States and the United Kingdom to invade Iraq in 2003, although several inquiries were conducted to investigate the matter. In 2007, US Federal Prosecutor John Durham concluded there was insufficient evidence of criminal conduct on behalf of US intelligence officials who had used the fake evidence as the basis for the Iraq invasion."
456,I made some bad cookies that are still edible. What’s another name I can call them that will lower expectations?,Hurl scout cookies,"

Homemade Treats!"
457,Commuting 62 Miles,"That is a lot of mileage on a vehicle.  That is a HUGE expense for gas and proper vehicle maintenance.    If you correctly report this commute to your auto insurance company, your auto insurance rates will likely go up also.  (most insurance companies want to know how far you drive to work - it is part of the calculation for your insurance.)  It isn't really making more money if that money is going into your gas tank instead of your wallet.

If this salary is based on a 40 hour work week and you are also driving 2 hours per day - then you actually have a 50 hour work week.  You can't really do much to make up for the time spent driving.  (maybe use the time for digital books - otherwise, it is just lost time that was lost because of your job)  Your time is valuable and giving up too much of just to get to and from work is a waste.

If you have no job - then take it.  Anything is better than nothing most of the time.  If you currently have a job, then take a very good look at how much it might cost you to drive so far vs what you spend to get to and from work right now.  Are you really gaining something from changing jobs?  Of course, if you hate your current situation or if this company is your ""dream job"", then the move may be worth it at any cost.  

I am just trying to tell you that sometimes the numbers sound good and look good on paper until you realize how much other things it is costing you for this change.

There is also the consideration of moving closer to the job to reduce the commute if possible.  Work it for a while to make sure you are going to stay there and then move closer."," A Day

Commuting 62 miles a day would be difficult to do on a regular basis. Depending on the route and traffic, it could easily take two hours or more of travel time. It would also be very expensive to travel this far each day. If possible, it may be worth considering living closer to work to lessen the commute. This would help save time and money, and would be less stressful."
458,I thought uploading videos to YouTube didn't use up data?,"When you upload something to YouTube, it still needs to download that file to put on there severs.","

Uploading videos to YouTube does not use up your own data, however, watching videos on YouTube does use data. When you upload videos to YouTube, the data is being used by YouTube and not by your device."
459,Why do people (especially army) eat crayons?,They're making fun of the army people for being stupid by saying they eat crayons. Like if you were in school you might accuse a fellow student of being a paste eater.,"

There is no known explanation for why people - especially in the military - would eat crayons. It is possible that it is a form of pica, a disorder that is characterized by an appetite for non-food items."
460,"If Napoleon somehow died (assissnation) at the height of the Napoleonic War, who would replace him? His 2nd in command?","This is tricky because there was no real established successor line aside from the general rules of Empirical inherency. There was never a peaceful change of power in the First French Empire, so there was no tradition or custom to follow. 

Depending on when Napoleon died, his son could have taken over. IIRC, when Napoleon abdicated finally in 1815, he named his son as the new Emperor. This is the expect line of succession for an Emperor. Of course, his son was just a boy, so regent would likely be assigned (who that regent would be, it's hard to say).

If Napoleon died before having his son, I could see Joseph Bonaparte (Napoleon's older brother) taking over, or at least having the strongest ""legitimate"" claim.

However, it would unlikely be this simple. There would no doubt be a power struggle between his marshals, his family, and there would likely be a monarchist surge at the time as well.","

If Napoleon were assassinated at the height of the Napoleonic War, his 2nd in command would be replaced by his brother Joseph Bonaparte, who was already in line to succeed him in the event of his death. Joseph had been named lieutenant-general of the imperial armies, and was to succeed him in the event of his death. Other members of the Bonaparte family, such as Jerome, Louis, and Lucien, may have been potential successors. After Joseph, the next in line would be Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Napoleon's Chief of Staff."
461,What’s a nice way to ask someone if they don’t want to talk to me when I’m initiating all the conversations,"Try just setting new expectations, if you generally initiate, then theyre expecting you to continue to do so, and thats not necessarily a bad thing. Tell them to that youre a little busy and to hit you up when they have the time. That way, youre subtly telling them to initiate, but youre also testing if they really like you. If they never hit you up, then cut your losses and move on

Hope this helps!","?

""Are you feeling like you don't want to talk to me right now? I'm happy to take a break if you need it."""
462,How do the phone companies know who to call when you dial 911?,"> Is it based on where you are?

Yes.

>  What if your GPS isn't working? 

It doesn't use your GPS, since only your phone knows its own GPS coordinates. Your phone is connected to a nearby cellphone tower, so your location for the emergency services is based around the location of the tower.

>  If I visit say China and call 911 who is gonna get my call its not gonna be the local authorities, so what station would get the call and why?

Nobody will get the call, because 911 is an invalid number in China. Countries have different emergency numbers. For example in Europe the number is 112 (however some countries will have 911 or 112 direct to their emergency number).","

When you dial 911, the phone company routes the call to the nearest emergency call center based on your registered address. This information is stored in the Enhanced 911 (E911) database. If the phone is a landline (as opposed to a cell phone), the telephone number is automatically provided to the emergency center, along with the address of the physical location associated with the phone. With cell phones, the global positioning system (GPS) may be used to help determine the location of the phone, and the mobile phone number is provided to the emergency center."
463,is he flirting with me or just being nice?,"Not enough info, but off of that you gave I would say probably","

It's difficult to know for sure without seeing the interaction first-hand. Why not try engaging in conversation with him and seeing how he responds? That will give you a better idea of how he truly feels."
464,Do most people watch reviews just to have their own opinion reaffirmed rather than to hear different opinions in general?,Yes 🤍,"

Most people watch reviews to form their own opinion, though some may watch reviews just to have their own opinion affirmed. People typically rely on reviews to make their own decisions, but it’s possible some people may watch reviews more to reinforce their existing views."

Yes, you should try to get a refund if you paid for a product that you didn't receive. Most businesses should be willing to accommodate refunds in situations where the delay is not due to their fault. Before attempting to get a refund, it's important to contact the business and check to see if they are able to do so."
466,Would it be harder to go without salt or sugar for the rest of your life?,Salt,"

It would be harder to go without salt for the rest of your life since salt is an essential part of the body's sodium regulation and metabolism. Without enough salt, you would develop nutritional deficiencies and suffer from a variety of health problems. It would be easier to go without sugar for the rest of your life, as sugar is not essential to achieving optimal health."
467,"In The Martian movie, when the potatoes die, why cant he grow more?","He had no space to grow more. The area where he was able to grow them, after he put in a lot of work to make that possible, was damaged beyond repair with the limited tools and supplies he had.","

When the potatoes die, Mark Watney (the main character) is unable to grow more because he only had a limited amount of seeds and does not have the equipment or ability to produce more from the existing crop. Additionally, the land he has to work with in the Hab (the airlock) is extremely limited, so there's nowhere else he can grow another crop."
468,Do all people have a sort of “lazy eye”?,Nobody is completely symmetrical.,"

No, not all people have a “lazy eye”. Lazy eye, also known as Amblyopia, is an eye condition wherein one eye does not develop normal vision due to lack of use. It usually occurs in childhood and is easily treatable."
469,Why do organisations and countries often not want to accept minority languages as official languages?,"Official language have other ramification, like the right to go to court in that language and stuff like that. Some belgian civil-servant told me that they loose a lot of time with getting every federal document bilingual and making sure that both version of the text say the same things

France is a very centralized country, and one of the first document which built modern France is that XVth century law saying that laws, courts and contracts have to use *Paris French* and no local dialect. Add  Napoleon and the Third republic, and every regional language was killed.","

There can be many reasons why organisations and countries may not want to accept minority languages as official languages. This could be due to a lack of resources or concern that it would lead to fragmentation and division in the country or organisation. Also, many organisations and countries may feel that having a single official language helps promote national unity and a sense of solidarity among the population. Additionally, the speakers of minority languages may not hold a strong enough political presence to successfully lobby for official recognition."
470,who do people not like their family seeing them workout?,"I hate anyone watching me workout. Family is the worst because they don't know what the fuck they're talking about, but they have no issues telling me that whatever I'm doing is wrong. 

I finally had to tell my wife that when I'm in the garage exercising, she is not to come interrupt me under any circumstance or else I was going to add a second deadbolt to the door that locks from the garage side","

It is not uncommon for people to feel self-conscious or uncomfortable when they exercise in front of their family. Some people may be too embarrassed to do things like lifting weights or showing off their abilities when their family is watching. Others simply prefer to keep their workouts private."
471,Why do fan speeds go from 1-2-3-0 instead of 0-1-2-3?,"Because it takes more effort to start the fan to keep it spinning, so the put the highest speed right after to make sure it can get going.","

Fan speeds usually go from 1-2-3-0 instead of 0-1-2-3 because the number 0 suggests off, while the number 1 suggests on. Having 0 as the last number in the sequence would suggest that the fan automatically turns off after 3, instead of having the option of turning it off completely."
472,Why do football coaches (NCAA/NFL) need personal security,"I am not a sportsball watcher, but I have seen many videos of people getting onto the field in spite of regular security and I've heard of fans who have feelings for coaches that are both very negative and very passionate, so I figure the extra security is prudent.","

Football coaches at the NCAA/NFL level are often high-profile individuals who face increased risks due to their public visibility. This heightened profile can result in potential safety hazards such as unwanted attention, physical harassment, or harassment from opposing fans. Personal security helps protect them from any potential threats and provides a secure barrier from any potential harm."
473,"Women of reddit, is having a gay best friend as a straight male a turnoff? If so, why?","Yes, it matters.  Because if your gf has an adverse reaction to him, then you know she's worthless.

Iy would not matter to me at all if my bf's BFF was gay.","

No, having a gay best friend as a straight male is not a turnoff. It sounds like you have a good friend who values your friendship and who you can trust to be honest and reliable. Everyone could use a friend like that."
474,What and why's it creepy going to a club alone as a man?,"Nothing creepy about that. You spend your time however you want and with whomever you want. As long as you're not hurting anyone by doing it, it's nobody else's business.","

Going to a club alone as a man can be creepy because many people may view it as a sign that the man is either desperate to meet a woman or is otherwise up to no good. Additionally, going to a club alone can put a man in a vulnerable position because he won't have anyone to watch his back in a potentially confrontational environment."
475,Why is there pretty much no representation of Middle East/Middle Eastern people in video games?,"There are a few. Assassin’s Creed, Prince of Persia, the recent Total War: Pharaoh, and many other games set in Egypt.

But yes it’s way less than games set in Japan and “Fantasy Europe”.","

The lack of representation of Middle East/Middle Eastern people in video games may be due to a variety of factors. One of the primary reasons may be due to the limited resources available to game designers. Due to the limited resources, creators often make decisions based on what is seen as most culturally or commercially profitable to focus on in video games.

When these decisions are being made, Middle Eastern representation may be seen as too niche to focus on compared to more mainstream character options. In addition, stereotypes and cultural biases may also be present when making decisions for game design, which could lead to less inclusive or even offensive characterization of Middle Eastern people in video games. In any case, more representation of Middle Eastern people in video games could potentially increase diversity and provide a more complex understanding for players."
476,Why am I so viscerally afraid of spiders?,I feel the same way. Only baby jumping spiders I find cute and not afraid to touch.,"

It is likely that you have an innate fear or phobia of spiders due to evolutionary predisposition. While spiders are generally harmless and not a threat to humans, they are perceived as creepy and as such our brains have been hardwired to be on the lookout for any potential spider that could harm us. It is a fear that is instinctual and that has been embedded in humans throughout our history."
477,Why do I sometimes feel a static pulsating feeling in my head and back?,"Hi /u/Hive_of_ants,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

This could be caused by tensing of muscles in your head and back due to stress or anxiety, or even an irregular heartbeat. It could also be caused by tension headaches or a form of migraine headache. If the feeling persists or becomes more severe, it is recommended to see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical issues."
478,It’s reported that sperm whale can create sounds up to 233 decibels. It takes at least 185 decibels to kill a person. Can sperm whales really kill us via Fus Ro Dah shout?,"Pretty much, yeah. It's not really a fus ro dah, but hey.","

No, sperm whales could not kill us with their Fus Ro Dah shout. Even though their call can reach a maximum of 233 decibels, this is still not enough to reach the 185 decibels needed to instantly kill a person."
479,Fun things I can do outside by my self?,"Give back to your community through volunteer work. Look into Rotary, as an example.","

1. Go for a jog
2. Go biking
3. Visit a park
4. Go for a nature walk
5. Draw or paint outdoors
6. Stargaze
7. Have a picnic
8. Read a book in the sunshine
9. Take photos of nature
10. Go bird-watching"
480,Can someone comfort me for a minute?,"Unfortunately, sometimes in life we can hurt people without meaning to. I think she probably knows you didn’t mean to hurt her, but you did, and if she keeps talking to you it will bring back those bad memories again. 

You did nothing wrong, and hopefully at some point you and she will reach a stage where you are able to talk again. 

Until then,
 
*HUGS*","

Of course! We all get sad sometimes but it will be okay. You are strong and brave and have people who care about you. Life is hard sometimes but everything will work out in the end. Let yourself take a deep breath and remember that you are always loved and supported."
481,How do I nicely tell a guy to chill out a little bit? lol,"every time he says something sexual: 

stare at him

don't say anything","

If you want to be gentle, you could say something like, ""I would really appreciate it if you could take it down a notch."" Or, ""It would be nice if you could tone it down a bit."""
482,What does “based” mean,"Finally, someone asks the real questions!","?

Based means to have a firm foundation, usually a foundation in fact or in theory, to draw a conclusion or to have a starting point."
483,How do I know what is and isn't a good car?,"Consumer Reports has one of the better auto buying guides.  They compile a lot of data on cost to own, reliability, etc.  They even have lists of suggested used cars in various price ranges.  It would be worth the small subscription cost to access it.","

When buying a car, there are certain things you should look for to ensure you're getting a good one. First and foremost, research, research, research - look into reliability ratings, read reviews, compare different models and trim levels, and learn as much as you can about the car's make and model. You should also pay attention to the overall condition of the car. Check for evidence of rust, dents, or other damage. Additionally, bring it to a mechanic before you drive it off the lot so they can look over the car and tell you if any major repairs are needed. Lastly, look into the car's history report, which can be obtained from a trusted service like CARFAX. This will tell you if the vehicle has ever been in a major accident or had any other issues."
484,Is it normal to mull over a car decision for multiple months?,Just get an old benzo its big enough and tough enough and fast enough geeez,"

Yes, it is normal to mull over a car decision for multiple months. Buying a car is a big commitment and many people make sure they take their time researching different models and options to ensure they make the best purchase for their needs."
485,Pavegen and Transparent glass solar panels ?,"If you want a photon to produce energy you have to absorb it. Any transparent solar pannel can only ever be some kind of dark glass that absorbs bits and lets throuh other light. That means it does not do the job of a window nor is it a good power source. And it costs like 20 times the price of glass.

The same is true for paving roads, its minimla enercy gains for incredible waste of resources.

Rock on the floor is cheap, highly processed metals, plastics and more on the road is expensive and polluting the environment.","

Pavegen is a technology that creates energy from the act of walking, running or jumping that can be stored in batteries or used to power various lighting systems and smart technology. It works by harvesting the kinetic energy of each footstep, converting it into electrical energy, and then transferring this energy to a data-capture platform.

Transparent glass solar panels are photovoltaic glass structures that use light to capture and create energy. They are glass panels made of a transparent solar photovoltaic material that is sandwiched between two panes of glass, allowing the light to pass through and to be converted into electrical energy. This energy can be stored in batteries or used to generate electricity to power various devices. The glass panels are thin, lightweight, and easy to install, making them ideal for a number of applications."
486,Can I make frozen yogurt just by freezing yogurt?,You need to stir it as it freezes. It’s most easily done with an ice cream maker,"

Frozen yogurt may be made by freezing whole milk yogurt, but it will likely not be creamy or have that classic frozen yogurt texture. In order to make creamy, flavorful frozen yogurt, you will need to add sugar and additional ingredients like cream and stabilizers like gelatin. For best results you should freeze the yogurt in an ice cream maker."
487,Can hickeys be dangerous?,"There have been cases where they have caused clots which have then resulted in strokes, some fatal.  They are though really fucking rare.","

Hickeys are typically not dangerous, but in certain instances, it could cause a localized infection or a blood clot. If someone is repeatedly sucked on, or the hickey is too large, it can also cause a bruise that can be difficult to heal."
488,Why should I care so much about the opinions of family ?,"its your life, live it how you want then","

Family is often the source of our deepest connections, loyalty and love, which can make their opinions particularly meaningful. Having their approval can be a source of motivation and confidence, as well as a reflection of our values. On the other hand, family can also be a source of criticism and hurt, so it is important to understand the effects different opinions can have on us before doing anything based on them."
489,can i put a clothes drying rack on carpet?,"It shouldn't be a problem. Hang longer items (like pants) towards the top so they don't touch the carpet. Try to have the drying rack as close to a heating source as possible, without it being a fire risk.

You could also place a towel down underneath the drying rack to absorb any drips if you're worried, or place the drying rack in the bathtub (if that's convenient for you).","

Yes, you can put a clothes drying rack on carpet, but it may be best to use a rug mat or non-slip pad underneath it to keep the drying rack from slipping or sliding."
490,Just saw a homeless man with a phone,"Hi /u/Fabulous_Air8956,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

That's really sad. Homelessness is a serious problem and it's unfortunate that many people don't have access to basic necessities that they need. It's important to look for ways that we can help those experiencing homelessness, whether that be through donations, volunteering, or just taking the time to listen to their stories."
491,Do other people define us?,"You define who you are to yourself.  
I decide what you are to me.","

Yes, other people’s opinions and thoughts can shape our identities, depending on how much we value those people’s opinions. How we believe others see us can influence how we see ourselves and how we behave in response."
492,Why do men get fired and/or written up at jobs for being emotional and/or loud but women don't?,Your personal experience likely doesn’t accurately represent reality. That’s just my take.,"

This is a complicated issue as it depends on many factors, such as the context of the emotional outburst, the company culture, and the way in which the outburst was expressed (e.g. shouting, aggression, etc.). Generally speaking, however, workplace emotional outbursts by men are often viewed as more unacceptable than those of women, as it is widely assumed that men should exercise more “control” over their emotions. This can lead to men being more harshly disciplined than women if they become emotional in the workplace."
493,Has men having to aim to pee vs women who do not have to aim shaped civilization?,"I think you have it backwards. It's the fact that women can't pee standing up that's driven civilization. If women, like men, could easily pee standing up, public urination would have remained a universal thing. Urinating on the side of the road, into a sewer grate, etc would have been the norm. We only would have developed toilets for shitting","

No, the plumbing methods of men and women have not had a significant effect on the development of civilization. There are many more factors that have had a greater influence on the development of civilization. Examples include technological advancement, scientific discoveries, religious movements, and political developments."
494,"Is yanking a car wheel, making the car swerve back and forth on the highway, considered abuse?","It sounds like it could be psychological abuse, yes.

In any case, abuse or not, he put both your lives in serious danger: that kind of behaviour can cause fatal accidents. I don't know if he was being deliberately abusive, or is suffering from some kind of psychological disorder that could be treated with therapy or medication. Either way, you probably shouldn't be spending your life with a man who might get you killed.","

No, yanking a car wheel is not considered abuse. However, it is dangerous and could potentially be considered reckless driving."
495,"How do Reddit collectible avatars work, and are they an investment?","Robux is currency. Avatars are NFTs. NFTs are scams.

You can spend $25,000 on the most ""unique"" avatar ever but you'd never see any returns because no one would ever want to buy your avatar because it's an NFT and NFTs are scams.","

Reddit collectible avatars are digital images that represent unique Reddit usernames. Some of these avatars come from real-world media like artwork, while others are original designs. They serve as a way for Redditors to express themselves and their interests while participating in the Reddit community.

Reddit collectible avatars are not an investment, nor do they hold any real-world value. They can be bought and sold between Redditors as a form of collector’s item and used to show off one's status in the Reddit community, but they will never yield any monetary rewards."
496,Hey have y'all ever do a lock in before?,Your adult friends want to do this too? I'm not knocking the idea I just wouldn't have done that at 21.,"

No, we haven't done a lock in before. However, we are always open to new ideas and believe that having a lock in would be a great way to promote safe and fun events for our community."
497,How do you get over betrayal?,"Damn that first sentence is a good way to put it. It just takes time, giving less thought and energy to the situation will become easier.","

It can be very difficult to get over betrayal, and unfortunately there is no one size fits all answer. Each person needs to work through their feelings in their own way. Some helpful ideas for getting over betrayal could include talking to a trusted friend or family member, trying different coping strategies like journaling, meditation, or talking therapy, engaging in activities that bring you joy, and being patient and kind with yourself."
498,"What is that ""Fwoosh!"" Sound you hear when things spontaneously combust?","If you're watching a movie or TV show, what you're hearing is a sound effect added in post-production to heighten the drama.","

Fwoosh! is the sound of a rapidly expanding and expanding cloud of flame, smoke, and air that can occur when something spontaneously combusts."
499,Why do backpacks seem more common with adults while out in public now?,The briefcase was determined to be 100% stupid and impractical.,"

Backpacks are becoming more popular with adults as they offer several advantages. They provide easier access to storage and are often more comfortable to carry than traditional handbags or briefcases. In addition, backpacks are typically more durable and offer more versatility than other bags, which is beneficial for people who are on-the-go."
500,Will having gone to a fancy high school haunt me in my adulthood?,No 😂,"

No, having gone to a fancy high school should not haunt you in adulthood. Your life experiences as an adult will be shaped more by your current decisions and actions than your past educational choices. People can and do succeed in all kinds of educational settings, so focus on making the most of your current opportunities."
501,What is the best way to spend time with a dog that doesn’t have much time left?,"Spoil him rotten! I did this with my girl before she passed a few years back. Buy all of his favourite treats, take him for rides in your car, play with his favourite toys, sleep with him, etc.

:)","

The best way to spend time with a senior dog that doesn't have much time left is to enjoy every moment spent with them. Take them for walks in their favorite places, play their favorite games, let them rest in the sun, and give them lots of love and attention. You can also make sure they're getting the best nutrition possible to keep their energy up so they can enjoy their time with you. Lastly, make sure to capture the moments by taking pictures or videos so you will always have the memories of your time together."
502,"Do souls age when they lose their bodies early on?(ie:child murder,premature death,etc)",That would imply an afterlife with the same consciousness and personality that was formulated here. Thats fairytale stuff.,"

No, souls are eternal and do not age. Although a soul may take on different characteristics based on its experiences, a soul does not age due to the loss of the physical body they were occupying."
503,Is it very normal in US to video record someone doing any random activity ?,"Not really. If you're watching videos that are viral or trying to be viral, those are probably staged.","

No, it is not very normal in the United States to video record someone doing any random activity. It may be legal to do so in certain jurisdictions, but without consent of all parties involved, doing something like this could be considered an invasion of privacy."
504,Why our body want to scratch a mosquito button while it only get worse when we do it ?,"Because it's itchy. Our body only tells us when we are itchy, it is up to the brain to act on the impulse","

When a mosquito bites, it injects its saliva into your skin, which contains proteins that can cause an itchy, allergic reaction. Scratching the area only makes matters worse because it can lead to further inflammation, and it can cause bacteria to enter the wound and lead to an infection. Additionally, scratching the area can cause the saliva to spread to other areas of the skin, increasing the possibility of further allergic reactions."
505,Is there a term to describe both and only Canadians and Americans?,Former British colonies of North America.,"

CanAmerican is a term used to describe Canadians and Americans collectively."
506,How safe is it to eat honey from a random beehive in the wild?,"Your question is unanswerable because you put the word ""random"" in there. 

A beehive deep in the Monongahela wilderness? Probably okay. Enjoy.

A beehive in the forests near the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown site? Or downstream from an industrial farm? I'd think twice.","

It is generally not safe to eat honey from a wild beehive as there's no way to tell exactly what bees have been feeding on. The honey could contain pesticides or other contaminants that could be dangerous to your health. It's best to purchase honey from a reputable source."
507,"Those of you who spend 10 minutes checking out when you finally get to the cash-register, what's taking so long?",Are you talking about self-checkout?,"

It is likely that the customer is counting their money, making sure they have the correct amount to pay, and possibly waiting for change. Also, some people tend to need more time to review their items and make sure they still want them before purchasing. People with disabilities are also given extra time to make sure they can pay for their items. Additionally, the customer may be waiting to show coupons and discounts which slow down the process."

509,Do you think it's bad to desire power and prestige for its own sake?,"Hi /u/HouseElf245,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

Yes, it is bad to desire power and prestige for its own sake as it often comes with negative consequences. These can include feelings of entitlement, exploitation of other people, and disregard for fairness or equity. Ultimately, it can lead to a lack of empathy and the inability to connect with others in meaningful ways."
510,My Female Co worker got me in serious trouble!,If this isn’t a bait story. Record it somehow. Gather evidence and protect yourself.,"

That is a difficult situation. You need to talk to your supervisor or HR department to report the issue and ensure that it is addressed. You should explain the situation in detail and provide any evidence or witnesses who can corroborate your story. If the situation is avoided or not taken seriously, you may want to consider seeking legal advice."
511,Looking for a new vet?,You call up the vet and ask if they are taking new patients.  Then make an appointment for a checkup.,"

When looking for a new vet, it's important to do some research and find one that is well experienced and has solid reviews. Ask friends and family for references or recommendations, or look for reviews on Yelp, Google, or other pet-industry websites. Make sure to read up on the vet's credentials, services they offer, and any other information available. Once you've narrowed your search to a few vets, it's a good idea to call or visit each one to see what type of atmosphere and customer service they offer. Ask how they handle emergencies, what types of payment methods they take, and what other services they provide. Also, make sure you feel comfortable with the vet, and that all of your questions are answered to your satisfaction."
512,Do people actually think the president controls everything?,"I `__USE__` to think that until I saw how just about everything Trump tried to do was _""blocked by a federal judge in whatever state""_ then I realized that it doesn't actually matter that much who the president is. The entire system is very resistant to change from the top-down. It really has to come from the bottom-up. The public have to really want it.","

No, most people understand that the President of the United States is limited by the constraints of the Constitution, laws passed by Congress, and the courts. They understand that while the President can influence policy and has significant powers, he does not control everything."
513,"Weird wet spot randomly appeared on bed, what caused it?","Drool, sweat, insert whatever here. The spot doesn't necessarily appear suddenly, it can take some time for body oils to oxidize, or maybe you just didn't notice it sooner.","

The most common cause of a weird wet spot randomly appearing on a bed is a leak somewhere near the bed. This could be a plumbing issue or a crack in the roof above it. It is also possible that the spot is caused by a spill or condensation."
514,Is 88% battery after 15 months good for an iPhone 12?,[deleted],"

Yes, 88% battery after 15 months is considered good for an iPhone 12. Apple states that its iPhone Battery should last up to 1000 charge cycles or 2-3 years of use, meaning 88% after 15 months is still in the normal range of performance."
515,"Owners of dog-aggressive dogs, why do you bring them to public places with other dogs?","I had a very ill-tempered Jack Russell Terrier (Terror). He was not a very stranger friendly dog, despite having puppy obedience training and proper socialization. He was just a one-person dog and that person was me. He never left my house without me having a tight hold on his leash, I wasn’t about to get sued because someone’s kid tried to pet my dog and got bit. He didn’t like other dogs either, he was an equal opportunity hater. He crossed the rainbow bridge in April at 15 years old and I sure miss the little monster.","

Owners of dog-aggressive dogs may bring them to public places with other dogs to help them learn how to better socialize with other dogs in a controlled environment. It takes a lot of patience and consistency for an owner to teach their dog how to properly interact with other dogs, and some owners see an experienced handler or trainer to help. Additionally, group agility and obedience classes may benefit a reactive dog since they can help build a level of focus and give a dog a job to do when confronted with other dogs. It may also be done as part of the healing process for an aggressive dog which can help them become more confident."
516,How much can the human body regenerate?,"It depends on the tissue lost.

If all you lose is some skin, it can come back. But if you lose  tissue that doesn't regenerate then it won't come back. Heart and brain cells don't regenerate. You have all the heart and brain cells you'll ever have.","

The human body has a remarkable capacity to regenerate, or heal itself after injury. Generally speaking, the body can regenerate most of its cells and tissues, including skin, hair, and nails. In some cases, the body is even capable of regenerating whole organs, such as the liver, which can completely regenerate after removal of up to 75% of the organ."
517,Do you turn on subtitles/cc's when watching movies/TVs?,Yes always,"

Yes, I usually do. Subtitles/closed captions can help a viewer understand the dialogue better, especially if they came in late to the movie or TV show."
518,Is it weird to want to tour a foreign country again rather than a new country?,No. There’s too much of Japan to condense in a single trip. It’s an amazing country. And sometimes you just fall in love with a place. Go where you’re happiest.,"

No, it is not weird to want to tour a foreign country again rather than a new country. Everyone has different travel desires, and some people prefer to explore a place they already know rather than adventuring somewhere new. There are often new things to discover and experiences to be had which one may have missed the first time around, so familiarizing yourself with a place is perfectly natural. "
519,Does anyone else feel like they can’t get a date and like they’re way uglier than their parents?,No.,"

It can be difficult to feel like you are not attractive or don't have the same luck in dating compared to your parents, but it's important to remember that everyone is different, and our parents’ experiences may not reflect our own. There could be a variety of reasons why you feel this way about yourself — it’s a good idea to talk to an unbiased third party who you trust about your experiences, like a guidance counselor or therapist. It may also be helpful to focus on building your self-confidence and believe in yourself. A lot of confidence comes from learning new skills, loving yourself, and having purpose. Spend time discovering what makes you unique and great and it will help build your self-esteem and make dating easier."
520,"If you are found not guilty of a crime, then later confess to doing the crime, can you still get in trouble?","""Confessing"" something on a TV show or camera isn't a legal confession.","

Yes, you could still get in trouble for a crime even if you were found not guilty of it, or have already been acquitted. The law of double jeopardy prevents you from being tried for the same offense twice, but depending on the circumstances, you may still be subject to other penalties such as fines or sanctions for making a false statement or perjury."
521,Has technology progress slowed down?,vR Muh dude. Also self driving cars.,"

It depends on how you define technology progress. Many people may feel that technology progress has slowed down since the pace of innovation has not been as rapid in recent years compared to previous decades. However, this could be more of a perception due to the greater accuracy and precision we have access to in today's world, meaning that the progress is not noticeable as quickly as before. In addition, with advances in technology, it is more difficult to reach the same degree of innovation as with past inventions. As new technologies are developed, the law of diminishing returns kicks in, making it more difficult to reach the same level of progress as before. Ultimately, it's difficult to accurately measure the exact rate of technological progress, but it likely hasn't slowed down significantly in regards to the overall rate of innovation."
522,EX resubscribed to my Disney+ du subscription. Is there anything I can do about it?,Cancel the credit card and report it as a fraudulent charge.,"

Yes, you can contact Disney directly and ask them to cancel your duplicate subscription. Disney usually offers a refund for subscriptions that have been canceled within 14 days of purchase."
523,"Why do things become less funny (for certain people) once they find out they're fake or scripted, yet TV shows and movies can still be funny?","As a pro wrestling fan, I've wondered this for years. Movies, TV shows, novels, songs, paintings, etc. are all created for other people to enjoy, but pro wrestling is the only one that is ""fake"" and therefore bad.","

There are various factors that can make something less funny for certain people once they find out it is fake or scripted, the primary being a lack of surprise and enthusiasm. If something is scripted or known to be fake, then any surprise twist or unexpected element that may have enhanced the original humour, is lost. For some people, this can take away from the overall comedic experience and make it feel forced or disingenuous. Additionally, some people have an appreciation for skill and it can be demotivating to know that what you thought was an improvised clever joke, was actually scripted beforehand. With TV shows and movies, there is still an element of surprise to them as well as often relatable, heartfelt stories, which drives the laughs."
524,does red lobster actually use the lobsters in the tank,"Yes, you can ask for a specific one to be cooked up for your meal.","

No, the live lobsters that are visible to customers in a tank such as the one at Red Lobster are generally there for display purposes only. Red Lobster and other seafood restaurants purchase their lobster from lobster suppliers who harvest them from the ocean."
525,What the hell is so bad about free insulin?,"Pretty much nothing, other than reduced profits.","

Free insulin is a type of insulin that is provided at no cost to people with diabetes. It is typically provided through government-funded programs, private programs, or charity organizations. While free insulin can be helpful to people with diabetes who have limited financial resources, there are some possible drawbacks. Some people may have difficulty accessing these programs, or accessing enough insulin to meet their needs. Furthermore, free insulin may not be of the same quality as insulin that is purchased from a pharmacy. Finally, some people may find that they are not able to adjust their dosages properly when using free insulin."
526,Should I still apply to stuff that I feel massively under-qualified for?,"No.  

You acknowledge it is your fault that you're severely lacking to be a qualified applicant yet you want to take that from someone who is?","

Yes, you should still apply to jobs you feel under-qualified for. Even if you are under-qualified, you may still have some transferable skills relevant to the job that could give you an edge over other candidates. Also, don’t be intimidated by the qualifications requested or the job description as often employers will hire someone who they feel is a good fit for the role, even if they don’t meet every requirement listed. Additionally, applying to a job you don’t feel completely qualified for can be a good way to gain experience and potentially learn new skills."
527,Does this type of building have a name?,Supermarket?,"

This type of building is known as a duplex, triplex, or multi-family dwelling."
528,is it fucked up to spray paint a spider purple,yes,"

Yes, it is definitely not something we would recommend. Not only would it not be respectful of the spider itself, but it could also cause harm to the environment."
529,Boiling water and vinegar in a small pot = reaction??,It's called the jumoes reaction. It's totally rad.,"

Boiling water and vinegar will produce a strong smell of vinegar vapor as the water evaporates. However, this is not a true chemical reaction and no new substances are formed."
530,"If animals could talk, which one would be the best comedian ?",Clown fish,"

The most likely animal to be the best comedian is probably a parrot. Parrots are intelligent and can be trained to imitate human speech and they love attention and social interaction. They also have a sense of humor and could make witty remarks and funny observations which would make them a great comedian."
531,"Before there was internet and cell phones, how did EVERY SCHOOL KID in the country learn the same rhymes and songs, like ""bo bo see atten tatten"" (or whatever it is), or ""joy to the world, the teacher's dead,"" or ""jingle bells, batman smells?""","Same way they still do. Word of mouth. Someone says something, it gets repeated and repeated till it's everywhere.

Something going viral happened long before the internet.","

Traditions and rhymes have been passed down orally for centuries. Before modern technology, rhymes were recited and sung to children in the schoolyard or in class. Additionally, a lot of these rhymes are in published books and poems such as Mother Goose Nursery Rhymes, Alice in Wonderland, and The Night before Christmas."
532,Is there a way this girl would be interested in men,"Out of the ~8 billion or so people in the world, only one knows the answer.    Talk to her.","

Yes, there is a way that this girl could be interested in men. There are many factors that influence romantic attraction and interest. A person's culture, family, past experiences, and preferences can all contribute to who they are drawn to. It is important to respect a person's individual boundaries and preferences when it comes to attraction. To foster a connection with this person, it would be helpful to get to know her better and develop an authentic connection to create an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide who they are interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with."
533,There were kids at the Bobert peep show.,"When men walk around topless on a beach in front of little kids, zero people give a shit, kids included. 

People need to get over this weird legalized fetish over women's nipples.","

No, there were not kids at the Bobert peep show because it is an adults-only entertainment venue."
534,How do you read laundry detergent dosage caps?,"Just put in a reasonable amount and see how it goes. Unless your clothes are filthy,you probably dont need as much as you think.","

Laundry detergent dosage caps normally have lines inside indicating an amount of detergent to use per load. If a dosage cap has one line, use one capful of detergent per regular load. If it has two lines, use two capfuls of detergent for a large load. If it has three lines, use three capfuls for an extra-large load. Always read and follow the instructions on your detergent bottle."
535,Why are trench coats associated with school shootings?,"There was a group of people at Columbine high school called the trench coat mafia. They were basically nerds and outcasts. Eric Harris briefly was a part of that clique, though he was on the periphery of it and never actually a part of it. But that story got repeated so many times that everyone thinks the Columbine shooters wore trench coats all the time.","

Trench coats have become associated with school shootings because of the Columbine massacre in 1999. The two shooters in that incident wore long, black trench coats. This has become a symbol of school violence and shootings, not only in the US but in other countries as well."
536,What subreddits are ok with me saying retard? Don't want to get banned for breaking the rules.,How often do you find yourself needing to use that word that this is an issue?,"

No subreddit is okay with you saying ""retard."" This word is widely considered offensive and abusive, and using it can get you banned from a subreddit, even if the subreddit doesn't explicitly prohibit it."
537,What’s the right way to avoid bee stings?,Hell idk if I’m allergic. How do you find that out ?,"

The best way to avoid bee stings is by not provoking the bees. Avoid swatting at them and also avoid wearing strong smelling perfumes or fragrances. If you are around a bee, move away slowly and calmly. Avoid wearing bright, flowery colors and carry an EpiPen if you are allergic to bee stings."
538,Can food have maggots if it's not rotten?,yes,"

No, food cannot have maggots if it is not rotten. Maggots infest and feed on spoiled, rotting food. If food is fresh and in good condition, it will not have maggots."
539,Will apple come back to get me?,"Hi /u/Ok-Wrap4955,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

No, Apple will not come back to get you. If you need help with an Apple product or service, the company offers customer support at support.apple.com."
540,Are there any non-Latino Spanish Americans in the US?,Yes there are Spanish Americans.,"

Yes, there are Spanish Americans who are not of Latino/Hispanic descent living in the US. Many are descendants of Spanish immigrants who arrived before the Latin American influx of the late 20th century. Additionally, many people of varied ethnic backgrounds (including White, African, Asian, and Indigenous) have adopted Spanish as their cultural language and may consider themselves Spanish American."
541,How does Matt Gaetz have the power to oust Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House?,McCarthy agreed to this in order to become Speaker. It only takes one person to start a vote to get rid of him.,"

Matt Gaetz does not have the power to oust Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House. According to the UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION:  “The House of Representatives shall chuse [sic] their Speaker and other Officers.” This means that only the House of Representatives have the power to select the Speaker and to remove him from his post. As such, it would require a majority of House members to form a consensus to oust the Speaker."
542,What’s an example of a sentence where you would use ‘flabbergasted’ in?,I'm flabbergasted that you've been using it wrong.,"

He was absolutely flabbergasted when she turned down the marriage proposal."
543,Why are so many more vegan women rather than men?,Interesting question! Perhaps it's related to women generally being more health-conscious.,"

There is no definitive answer as to why there are more vegan women compared to vegan men. Some suggest that societal pressures may have a role to play, as women are often encouraged to adopt certain eating habits and be more health conscious than men. Additionally, some research has suggested that vegetarian and vegan diets are more popular among younger generations, and women may have better access to the information and resources needed to adopt a vegan lifestyle. Finally, there may be individual cultural, socioeconomic, and health-related factors that contribute to the gender gap in veganism."
544,Is Generation Z really becoming more Luddite/Technophobic?,"Not that I've noticed. I have noticed that, being used to Android and IOS on phones and tablets that they often lack skills with more traditional desktops and laptops. The concept of what a file is, and where it is located in a filesystem made up of nested folders, is very hard to teach them, they're used to using apps that hide the underlying filesystem from them. But it's not technophobia, it's just anxiety about learning something new.","

Generation Z is not becoming more Luddite or Technophobic. While there are members of the generation that may avoid technology, the majority enjoy the use of technology and many recognize its importance in everyday life. Studies have found that Gen Zers are more digitally connected than any previous generation, and their reliance on technology and access to it continues to grow."
545,Am I still insane if I smile to myself in public but realize I’m doing it?,"It's, uh. It's not insane to smile in public in the first place.","

No, you are not. Smiling to yourself in public is a normal behavior and is not an indication of any type of mental illness."
546,Is my hair supposed to look greasy and terrible after only 1 day of not showering?,"Your’s… maybe. Someone else… maybe not. All depends on your biological makeup. I’m an oily guy who has to wash everyday. Benefit, I look about 10-15 years younger because I don’t wrinkle. My wife has fairly dry skin, she can go days w/out washing her hair and it still looks and smells great. It’s all your biology.","

No, your hair should not look greasy and terrible after only 1 day of not showering. It may look a bit oily or less pristine than normal, but it should still be relatively healthy and clean looking. If your hair looks significantly greasy and terrible after only 1 day of not showering, you may have a scalp condition that needs to be addressed."
547,"I think I'm catching feelings for another person but I'm in a relationship, what do I do?","Feelings and people change, and sometimes relationships just don’t satisfy like they once did. You can still love your girlfriend and not be in love with her, which sounds like the case if you’re finding yourself catching feelings for another girl. The best thing to do in this kind of situation is to really think it over and decide if your existing relationship is worth salvaging or if you’d like to see where things could go with this other girl. Either way, you’re not a bad guy just because your feelings have changed. It’s normal, especially when you’re a teenager, to sometimes grow apart from people over time. If you do decide to see where things go with the new girl, just be sure you’re doing right by the current one and respect her enough to leave her first rather than end up cheating on her.","

This isn't an easy situation to be in and it's important to be honest with yourself and your partner, as well as your feelings. Start off by thinking and assessing your feelings. Ask yourself if your feelings for this other person are fleeting or they have been underlying and growing over time. Also, consider the type of relationship you have with your current significant other. Are the two of you still actively working to cultivate that relationship? Have you been honest with your partner lately? Additionally, ask yourself what kind of emotions this other person elicits from you. Are your feelings strong or fleeting? 

Once you've assessed your personal feelings towards this other person, you can decide if you want to bring up the topic with your current partner. This isn't an easy conversation to have and although it can bring up some tension, it is important to be honest and considerate. Be sure to communicate that you value your relationship, but that these feelings may be getting in the way of connecting with your partner.

If after talking to your partner, it doesn't feel like there is any way to resolve this, it might be time to consider ending your current relationship. A break up can be difficult, so make sure you make the right choice for yourself and think everything through before making any dramatic changes."
548,do yellow jackets remember people?,There is some evidence to suggest that wasps and honey bees can recognize faces.  https://theconversation.com/are-they-watching-you-the-tiny-brains-of-bees-and-wasps-can-recognise-faces-100884,"

No, yellow jackets do not remember people."
549,How do I tell someone they won’t be hired back next summer for a seasonal job?,"My summer job used to give us three options- rehire, reinterview, or don’t come back. If they’re good kids you could give them the reinterview option and see if they’ve matured come next summer. Kids can make a big jump when it comes to responsibility in just one school year.","

It can be difficult to break the news to someone that they won't be hired back for a seasonal job. It is best to be direct, honest, and provide supportive feedback along with the decision to not hire them. Start by thanking them for their hard work and dedication to the job. Give a reason why you are not rehiring them, such as job openings being filled by more experienced people, budget limitations, etc. Reassure them that their hard work was appreciated and that it is not a reflection of their performance in the job. Finally, thank them again for their service and wish them the best in the future."
550,I Have hair like underarm hair and facial hair it means I done growing I am turning 17,Not necessarily. Body hair growth doesn’t indicate that your physical growth has stopped. You could still have a couple inches in you or you could be done.,".

No, it does not mean that you are done growing. It just means that you are beginning to mature and grow into an adult. Every person is different when it comes to physical growth and development so it is hard to determine when a person is done growing."
551,Can the UAW be disbanded?,Found the corporate capitalist union buster!,"

Yes, in theory, the UAW (United Auto Workers) can be disbanded, but this would be a difficult and lengthy legal process. The decision would ultimately be made by either a majority vote of UAW members or the International Executive Board of the UAW."
552,Why does 60 degrees at Night in september feel different than 60 degree nights in July?,"Probably humidity. Water transfers heat faster than air. So, cold air with high humidity takes heat from your body faster than the same temperature air with low humidity.","

The temperature in September is much cooler because it's the transition month from summer to fall. The air is usually much less humid and there is less sunshine during the day, so the nights feel much cooler. In July, the air is much warmer and the humidity is higher which makes the nights feel much warmer even though they may be the same temperature."
553,How many nuclear weapons does any country actually have ready to go at any time?,Pretty sure that information isn't know to the public by design.,"

The exact number of nuclear weapons held by each country is not made public, but estimates suggest that the United States has approximately 3,800 deployed nuclear weapons, Russia has roughly 4,300 deployed nuclear weapons, and other nuclear-armed countries combined have roughly 380 deployed nuclear weapons."
554,"I was reading a book on the Internet Archive and now I can no longer access it because it says it's, ""only available to those with print disabilities,"" now. How do I get print disabilities to be able to finish the book? Thanks in advance.","That's usually temporary because someone checked it out, you'll be able to access it again at some point like a digital library book","

Depending on where you are located, you may be eligible for a free legal copy of the book if you have a print disability. If you are in the United States, you can go to Bookshare.org and sign up for an account. They provide free accessible books to qualified individuals with disabilities. You can also see if an accessible version of the book you are trying to find is available on the Accessible Books Consortium, which provides access to titles for people with print disabilities in many countries and languages."
555,"on a youtube someone said ""in the history of man, recordable media has evolved into VHS tapes twice? If it happens one more time it will have tied with lobsters."" What does he mean by the lobster bit?","They actually mean crabs, a weird phenomenon in biology where multiple animals have [evolved crab-like species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation).","

The person is using the lobster bit as a way of saying that a recordable media evolving into VHS tapes twice is highly unlikely. It would be a rare occurrence for something to happen twice, much like the chances of a lobster randomly walking into your house would be slim to none."
556,Paying a subscription with expired card,Maybe they forgot to charge and it was a mistake in their system?,"

If your credit card is expired, the payment will not be processed. You will need to provide a new form of payment to renew your subscription. If you are unable to do so, your subscription will be canceled."
557,"Do you ask other women in the bathroom, if they have a tampon?","Back when I would need them, if I didn't have them and needed them, yes.","

No, it is not appropriate to ask other people in the bathroom if they have a tampon. If you need help, it is best to ask a trusted friend or an employee at the facility."
558,Moon rise at 9AM?,"There's this misconception that the moon is only out at night. This is in no way true. In fact, if it was, there'd never be solar eclipses. 

The monition of the moon and the sun are not really connected.","

Moon rise is not dependent on a certain time such as 9 AM. The actual time of moonrise is determined by the moon's position in relation to the position of the sun in the sky. Additionally, the time of moonrise varies slightly from one day to the next, based on the moon's orbital motion around the earth."
559,How come some people know how to draw and others don’t?,"Different people's brains are wired differently. I'm really good at learning languages. I know plenty of people who *suck* at it. Likewise, I absolutely suck at drawing. 

We're all different.","

The ability to draw is a skill that is acquired through practice and dedication. Some people may have more natural talent or inclination for drawing than others, but everyone can learn how to draw to some degree if they are willing to dedicate time and effort to the practice. There is no single answer as to why some people can draw better than others, as it is a mix of motivation, patience, practice, and natural talent."
560,"Why does Marvel sell more comics than DC? Even before the MCU, Marvel had bigger comic sales than DC.","they don't always sell more.  in 1999 DC sold more.  

https://images.app.goo.gl/1hxXLpdpypZC4TjV9"," This is because Marvel emerged during the golden age of comics and quickly became the dominant publisher. Marvel's characters and stories were more relatable and were seen to be more modern, whereas DC's heroes like Superman and Batman felt more out of touch with current challenges. Marvel also emphasized character development, making its stories more engaging and interesting to readers, while DC tended to focus more on action sequences and spectacle. Furthermore, Marvel had a more diverse lineup of characters that appealed to a broader audience. As a result, Marvel quickly gained an edge and continues to dominate the comic book industry."
561,Why doesent OSHA decibel limitations apply to concerts as it would the workplace?,"They’re concerned with occupational health and safety. You sort of have to go to work, so OSHA makes sure that you’re not obligated to take on unnecessary risk by doing so. 

Concerts are a leisure activity, you can easily not go or bring your own ear plugs if you’re unwilling to risk hearing damage. 

As for employees of the production or venue, the employer would be required to provide hearing protection.","

OSHA decibel limitations are intended to protect workers from hazardous noise levels that could lead to long term hearing loss or other physical damage. Concerts are attended voluntarily and sound levels can generally be controlled to a certain degree by the individual, so it may not be necessary to enforce the same safety limits that apply in the workplace."
562,If I’m really looking for good anonymous advice what’s the best platform to ask?,Reddit ?,"

There are many anonymous advice platforms available online, including Quora, Reddit, and 4chan. These platforms allow you to ask questions and get answers from people around the world anonymously. Before using any of these advice platforms, ensure you are certain you are okay with receiving advice that may not be based on expertise or professional advice."
563,Does she hate me? :(,"I expect that Tanya was also warned against speaking to you. She had not only her job to lose but also her marriage. I don't think there's anything here to indicate that she hates you, just that she chose to keep her job and her marriage over flirting with you.","

It depends on what you've done or said to her, and how well you know her. If you're not sure, it's best to ask her directly."
564,Can recovering alcoholics use nonalcoholic drinks as an aid?,"Yes they do. This is the reason Liquid Death water exists: it's water packaged like beer so that recovering alcoholics can go to bars, concerts etc and socialise without drinking alcohol or feeling self conscious about their choice.","

Yes, recovering alcoholics can use nonalcoholic drinks as an aid in recovery. Nonalcoholic beverages provide much needed hydration and nutrition, while helping to reduce cravings and prevent temptation. Many recovering alcoholics also find that nonalcoholic drinks such as water, tea, and coffee provide support and relief during difficult moments of withdrawal or recovery."
565,I took old medication and then had federal drug test. Freaking out. Could I test positive?,"Hi /u/BBpercoPill,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

It depends on the drug in question. Many medications are quickly metabolized in the body, so if you took a medication that has a short-lived presence in the body, it is unlikely you would test positive. However, some medications can stay in the system for a longer period of time, so if you took a drug that has a longer half-life, it is possible you could test positive for it. You should speak to your doctor or pharmacist about the specific medication you have taken and how long it can stay in the body."
566,What are the limits of human exploration in the universe?,Depends on how much time you are willing to spend as an astronaut on a one way ticket to death.,"

The limits of human exploration in the universe depend greatly on technological advancements and scientific discoveries. While space exploration is currently limited by the amount of time it takes to physically reach distant stars, one day advanced propulsion systems may allow us to travel much faster. Additionally, advances in robotics and artificial intelligence may one day allow us to send robotic probes to explore the more distant parts of the universe that are too far for humans to reach."
567,Am I being selfish for peoples sad stories to make me cry?,"This is likely empathy. 

And extreme of it would be histrionic personality disorder, where you make others’ sadness fully your own, but that isn’t what it sounds like.","

No, it is perfectly natural and normal to feel sadness in response to someone else’s suffering. It is a sign of empathy, which is a positive trait. It is only selfish if you are focusing solely on your own sadness and not thinking about how you can help the other person or share in their sorrow."
568,On a scale of 1-10 how risky is this text?,"I don't think you gave them many avenues of response.

Like, if someone sent that to you, how would you reply?","

3.

This text is not very risky, and can generally be considered to be low risk."
569,Why do people still joke about Australia being a prisoner colony when Georgia doesn’t get joked on for being a debtor colony?,Americans don't have a good grasp of world history.,"

Australia was settled as a penal colony, whereas Georgia was founded as a debtor colony. Whereas Australia's early settlement was dominated by the transportation of convicts from the British Isles, Georgia's early history was shaped by the debt issue, not penal servitude. Additionally, while Australia now stands as one of the world's wealthiest and most advanced countries, much of Georgia's history has been rife with economic struggles and numerous financial crises. For these reasons, it is clear why Australia's past is seen to be more comical than that of Georgia's."
570,Something near light speed approaching a camera,"Cameras don't ""see"" anything, they just take photos of whatever they're pointed at. A still camera takes one image each time you press the button. Movie cameras take anywhere from 50 to 1,000 pictures per second, but even at 1,000 pics per second.

An object moving at light speed or anywhere near it wouldn't movie slowly enough to be recorded unless the object was many millions of miles away at the start, and so large that you could see it from that distance. That would basically be like a planet sized asteroid, and it would move in and out of any kind of visual standpoint so quickly that it would be pure freakish luck if you could take a picture of it at all, and even if you got lucky the object would just look like a blur, even at a rate of 1,000 photos per second.

In short, there's nothing that could move at that speed that's also big enough to be seen if it was moving anywhere near light speed. Something the size of a jet wouldn't be within range of sight for more than like 0.000000000000000001 seconds", mounted on a stationary object will appear to move very quickly in the direction it is travelling across the camera. The light from the object will appear to move across the frame at a rate of speed that is relative to its actual speed. If the object is moving at the speed of light then the camera won't detect any motion at all as the speed of light is too fast for light to be perceived.
571,Why is my reddit feed not showing good effort posts on certain subreddits?,"Reddit's app sucks quite a bit. ""Oh you interact with this sub? Cool! You're going to see it every fifth post to infinity."" (The fourth post is an ad and the cycle continues.)","

Reddit feeds can be personalized based on a variety of criteria, including the subreddits you regularly visit, the posts you upvote or downvote, and your overall user activity. This means that if you regularly visit certain subreddits but rarely upvote or comment on posts, the Reddit algorithm may filter out the bulk of ""good effort"" posts from showing up in your feed. To ensure you're still seeing higher quality posts, you should regularly upvote content that interests you and engage in conversations on the various subreddits you visit."
572,Why do babies randomly hit their parents? 🤣,Depends on the age. A really little baby might just be figuring out how arms work and flailing around. A toddler might do it to express frustration. And sometimes babies do things just to study reactions and understand the world - this is a big part of chucking stuff off high chairs.,"

It’s normal for babies to hit, grab, and pinch as a way to explore and learn, as well as to express their thoughts and feelings. It’s a way for them to communicate and can sometimes mean they want attention, are frustrated, or are trying to indicate that something is bothering them."
573,How do you find meaning in your life?,"You don't really find meaning you pick meaning you decide what the meaning of your life is going to be for yourself. 

If you feel like your life has meaning then it does, if you feel like your life has purpose then it does, if you feel fulfilled in your actions then you are fulfilled. 

There's no other meaningful metric to gauge meaning in life.","

Finding meaning in life can take many forms. Such as living in accordance to one’s values, accomplishing goals, service to others, enjoying simple pleasures, and connecting with loved ones. It is also important to focus on the present moment and appreciate the small victories and moments, as life is composed of moments, not days."
574,How often do you take a dump?,"Depends on activity and diet. Generally once a day, but very often twice a day.","

It varies from person to person, but generally once a day is considered healthy for most adults."
575,"Am I colorblind? I’ve had debates in the past about white vs. green and gray vs. blue. Tonight, it was suggested perhaps I am colorblind. I am female so I never thought possible.","You could be. Google ""colorblindness test"" and you'll get some very easy, quick tests you can use to check.","

No one can answer this question for you except for your doctor. If you are concerned, it would be best to consult your doctor for a test to determine if you are colorblind."
576,What will happen when we run out of oil?,"Back in the mid-90s when crude oil prices spiked there was a push to convert vehicles to run on natural gas with the tagline ""The stone age didn't end because we ran out out stones"", so there is always a plan-B that is currently just a little too expensive to compete.

That said: Google peak oil failed predictions to gain an understanding why no one over 30 takes these ""out of oil by 20XX"" predictions seriously","

When we run out of oil, it will have major implications for our economy and our way of life. The world will have to find alternative sources of energy to replace oil, such as solar, wind, and hydropower. In addition to energy sources, society will need to find alternative resources for products that currently rely on oil, such as plastics and petrochemicals. There may also be other environmental and social consequences associated with a shift away from a reliance on oil, such as income insecurity and air pollution."
577,"What time do you, go to bed and get up? Normal day vs weekend?","Normal day 10:00 get up 6:00.

Weekend 10:00 get up 6:00.

I have a child and a cat.","

On a normal day, I usually go to bed around 11 PM and get up around 8 AM. On the weekends, I tend to go to bed later, usually around 12 AM, and wake up later, usually around 9 AM."
578,How much time is needed to learn Python quickly?,"Depends how complicated the project is. Also depends if you've done a bit of programming before and understand how it works. For programming stuff I've had to do for uni in Matlab and Arduino I just jumped in. Anything I didn't understand or know how to do I just looked it up, watched 5 mins of a YouTube video and solved the problem.","

The length of time it takes to learn Python depends on individual learning pace and how familiar you already are with coding concepts. However, it is possible to learn Python basics in as little as a few weeks with dedicated practice for approximately 3-5 hours per day."
579,Are live broadcasters for sports events televised on the popular network given teleprompted scripts to read that are written by someone else and served up to them?,"Not usually, no. There's a main commentator and a color commentator and they need to have some familiarity and rapport with each other or the broadcast is going to be boring

When the two are really good, like Troy Aikman and Joe Buck for example, they're worth their weight in gold","

While some are saying lower T it doesn't make sense as some women get more facial hair after menopause. Which is when Estrogen levels drop.","

They do make plastic zippers. They don't last as long as metal ones.","

Snap and zipper technology has essentially stagnated because they are both older technologies that have been around for a long time. While newer materials and means of construction have been developed, snap and zipper technology have not seen a similar resurgence in innovation due to the continued reliance on simple design principles and the fact that they have become so common they are no longer viewed as a necessary area of advancement. Additionally, newer technologies are often more cost-effective when compared to these older ones, so companies may be more interested in investing in different methods."

605,Is it normal for my knees to pop when they bend? My wrists pop too?,"Yeah, its normal, welcome to existing as a watery bag of meat and bones held together by rubber bands. Youre gonna make some funny noises.

On a serious note though, its fine. Nothing to worry about unless theres pain or discomfort or it looks messed up. My knees pop a lot, but my ankles are ridiculous. Literally every few steps they pop. 

I think the science reason is that during normal everyday activity gas pockets can form in the fluid in your joints, and when you move them a certain way the gas expels and makes a popping noise. Same noise as cracking ur knuckles. Dont quote me on that tho, been a while since i knew that for sure.","

Yes, it is completely normal for your knees and wrists to pop due to natural movements like bending and stretching. The popping occurs because of the release of gases like nitrogen from the joint capsule due to pressure changes. This often triggers a cracking or popping sound. The popping is completely harmless and should cause no pain or discomfort."
606,Where do you draw the line for prostitution being an exploitation or a choice,"When it comes down to it, a very small percentage of sex workers are doing it because they enjoy the work they do.

I’d prefer to see us change the world to one where sex work isn’t the best option for young women and men to live a decent life.","?

The answer to this question is subjective, and depends largely on one's personal ethics and beliefs.

616,What happens to your body physiologically when you do cardio?,"There is a whole list of physical adaptations. Short version is that your body develops the ability to deliver more oxygen to the tissues, and the ability to use more oxygen to develop the energy needed to respond to the metabolic demand. 

BTW, initially, people gain strength from lifting by learning to use the muscle mass they have more efficiently to generate more force. Most people can double their strength levels without much increase in muscle mass. Eventually, yes, muscle size has to increase its cross-sectional area to continue to increase strength, but increased strength has a significant neural component.","

When you do cardio, your body responds by increasing heart rate, increasing respiration rate, increasing blood flow to muscles and increasing body temperature. This response is what enables your body to efficiently use oxygen as a fuel source, burn calories, and improve cardiovascular fitness and endurance. Other physiological changes that occur during cardio include increased production of endorphins and increased production of certain hormones, such as adrenaline."

The French Revolutionary War was a period of uprisings and political unrest throughout the country, which created a difficult situation for the French government when Napoleon Bonaparte sought to build a long-lasting French Empire. However, Bonaparte and his successors managed to assemble a massive army through forced conscription. They created new military regulations, including harsher punishments for desertion and reduced age requirements, to ensure full compliance. Simultaneously, advancements in technology allowed for rapid recruitment and mobilisation of troops. Furthermore, the French government embarked on a series of military campaigns and grand strategic manoeuvres, inspiring a sense of patriotism among French citizens and strengthening the loyalty of the military for Napoleon. These tactics, combined with an improved financial infrastructure and ruthless methods of quelling internal dissent, allowed the French Empire to rapidly expand its army to one million troops, establishing an influential military force for the period."

637,Why is everyone able to afford iPhones even tho they are crazy expensive?,Generally they pay it off as part of their phone plan instead of buying one up front,"

The affordability of iPhones is due to their popularity and the fact that many come with payment plans that allow users to pay them off in installments instead of a single, upfront cost. Additionally, Apple offers trade-in programs for old devices, enabling customers to get money back for trading in an older iPhone towards a new one. This helps to reduce the overall cost of the device."

Stopping right here with this nonsense.","


It depends on the situation. If the situation is an emergency, then seek out the appropriate help – call 911, go to the hospital, or contact your local emergency services. If the situation is not an emergency, then it is best to consider what your options are and assess the best course of action for the particular situation. Consider speaking with someone you trust like a friend, a doctor, or a therapist, for advice and guidance."
639,Is there a nutritional difference between a slice of bread and a slice of toast?,Slim to none.,"

Yes, toasting bread changes the nutritional content of the slice. Toasting a slice of bread reduces the amount of water-soluble vitamins, like vitamins B-1, B-2, and B-3, and destroys up to 25% of the folates. The total carbohydrate content of the bread may also be slightly lower after toasting. Toasting increases the amount of dietary fiber, total fat, and total phenols in the bread. Additionally, the antioxidants in bread may be more available after toasting."
640,How did AIDS evolve from being a disease in chimpanzees to being amongst homosexual men?,"Its thought it may have spread through butchering bush meat.

Also, most people with HIV aren't gay men","

AIDS is believed to have originated from chimpanzees that were infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). In the late 1970s, it is believed that this virus mutated and spread to humans, most likely through contact with infected chimpanzee blood. As the virus spread, it rapidly mutated, eventually leading to HIV, which eventually evolved into AIDS. 

Although the exact route of transmission from chimpanzees to humans is unknown, it is believed that significant contact between humans and chimpanzees—through hunting, butchering, or through infected needles—played a role in the cross-species transmission. 

After the virus was introduced to humans, the virus was believed to have initially spread mainly among heterosexual people. However, over time, HIV-infected blood was spread through homosexual people through unprotected sexual intercourse, and eventually, AIDS became associated with, and disproportionately impacted, homosexual men in many parts of the world."

How do I contribute meaningful support to Women of Color (specifically Black Women) when moving to a more diverse area is not an option (my entire family lives here),"Rise your children with the same values, you don't need something that people can point to, if you really want to help","

1. Invest in businesses owned by and committed to serving Women of Color, especially Black Women, in your area. This includes choosing to shop at these stores and restaurants, patronizing Black-owned service providers such as hair, makeup, and skincare providers, and promoting these businesses. 

2. Educate yourself on the experiences of Women of Color, especially Black Women, and use this knowledge to become an ally and advocate for their needs and interests.

3. Support your local organizations, charities, and community groups that work for and advocate for Women of Color, especially Black Women. Donate your time, resources, and funds to help them in their vital work.

5. Amplify the voices of Women of Color by recognizing their accomplishments, bolstering their efforts, and celebrating their successes within your own communities.

6. Use your voice and position to call attention to and address any injustices or disparities affecting Women of Color, particularly Black Women, in your area.

7. Speak out against racism, white supremacy, and other forms of discrimination in your community and call on other community members to do the same. 

8. Vote for candidates who champion diversity, inclusion, and justice for Women of Color, especially Black Women."
642,"Can people with a photographic memory watch reruns in their head, rather than having to watch them?",There's no such thing.,"

It is possible, but not likely. People with photographic memory are thought to be able to remember an exceptionally large amount of detail about a certain event or item they have seen, often down to the exact layout of details. However, this type of memory is not the same as watching a video. Recalling an episode of a rerun likely could not be done with such vividness as when it was actually seen."
643,"When people say ""I make $XXX"" or ""Would I survive if I only make $XXX living in NYC?"", do they generally mean pre-tax or after tax?",Pre-tax,"

It usually depends on the context. If someone is asking whether they can afford to live in a certain location, or if they can live off the amount of money they are making, they usually mean the amount after taxes has been taken out. If someone is bragging about or discussing the amount of money they are making, they are usually referring to the pre-tax amount."

648,Am I insane or does it sound like a ton of songs on the radio are sped up/pitched up slightly?,"Not insane. Not every station does this, but it’s been a practice some stations have used for decades. A station might play 10-12 songs in an hour. If you can speed it up enough to shave just a little more than a second off a three-minute song, you can sell an additional 15-second ad spot. If you speed them up even more, it generates even more sellable time.","

No, you are not insane. It's quite common for producers and engineers to speed up and pitch up songs when they are recorded during the mixing and mastering process. This can make the vocals sound higher and more energetic. The sped up/pitched up version of a song may be used to create a dance/club mix, or if the original song is too slow-paced, then the sped up version might be used for radio."
649,How many people broke up because of the barbie movie?,"Could you link the story/post? I have no clue, but i also want to know, and why?","

And have you always slept with a fan on? It could have become a part of your sleep routine, which means it would be hard to sleep without it","

It is normal to become accustomed to the sound of a fan (or any other white noise) while trying to sleep. Over time, your brain can become conditioned to associate the sound of a fan with relaxation and sleep. Eventually, the sound of the fan can help lull you into sleep, and without it, it can be hard to find that same level of comfort and relaxation necessary to get to sleep."
653,How would I go about having my fiancé and friends do a comedy roast on me?,My advice: DON'T DO IT!,"

1. Pick a location to hold the roast. This can be a restaurant, bar, or even the comfort of your own home.

2. Invite your friends and fiancé. Make sure everyone invited is comfortable enough to participate in the roast.

3. Prepare the agenda and format. You could assign certain comic themes to each person, such as “the best/worst thing about you”. Setting a time limit for each person’s “speech”, and providing snacks or refreshments could make it more enjoyable.

4. Encourage the participants to keep it light-hearted. Joking about yourself can be nerve-wracking, so remind everyone to keep it funny but not too personal.

5. Remember to laugh at the jokes! Don’t be too serious and don’t worry too much about what’s being said. Enjoy yourself and have fun!"
654,Migration Choices: African Refugees' Paths to Europe,because europe is even wealthier,"

African refugees seeking to relocate to Europe have a variety of migration choices available to them, depending on their individual circumstances. Those seeking asylum may apply to either the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or to individual European nation-states. Additionally, depending on visa requirements, African refugees may apply for family reunion permits, labor migration, educational exchange programs, or other kinds of humanitarian permits; all of which have varying requirements, timelines and success rates.

For African refugees who have already reached Europe without permission, there are often limited options available. Access to asylum is possible through the European Union’s Common European Asylum System, which is mostly based on the Geneva Convention. However, many European countries have tightened their asylum provisions in recent years, making it more difficult for refugees to be accepted. Additionally, once refugees have arrived in Europe, it can often be difficult for them to obtain the necessary documents to legally work or study, meaning that their choices are limited to either living in precarious situations or using illegal means to make money.

Whichever path African refugees choose, their journey is often fraught with danger, desperation, and disappointment. Although the choices may make their journey easier, an effective and safe transition to Europe is often a difficult, if not impossible, goal to achieve. Consequently, any attempt to reach Europe—be it legal or illegal—should be carefully considered, as even when a desirable outcome is attained, this can often come at the expense of the African refugee’s safety and well-being."

Is 7up a rip off of Sprite?

Is Pepsi a rip off of coca cola?

Because Hershey's has a chocolate bar, is nobody else allowed to make chocolate bars?","?

Most shops don't get sued for their own rip off products because it can be difficult to prove that the product is a rip off. Shops may claim that the design of their product is unique and that any similarities it has to existing products are coincidental. Additionally, it may be difficult to prove that a shop intentionally tried to copy an existing product. It can also be difficult to prove that a shop has infringed upon another company’s intellectual property rights. Furthermore, pursuing a lawsuit can be time consuming and expensive."

People may be quick to judge and attribute one wrong action as indicative of a person’s true character and nature. Unfortunately, humans tend to look for the worst in people and often overlook the good. It's also possible that the one wrong thing is interpreted as bigger than it may be, due to the preceding good choices made. People often pay more attention to mistakes rather than successes, so the one wrong thing stands out more. It's important to remember that everyone is capable of making mistakes, and that people change and evolve over time."

I've changed fuses with and without the electricity running through the vehicle and there's not enough power for anything to arc or bother you, especially with a dead one","

To ensure your safety, it is important to make sure you are familiar with the location of all fuses and that they are correctly labeled, as well as what type and amperage they should be. It is also important to disconnect the battery before attempting to work on the electrical system, to avoid any electrical shock or injury. Additionally, if it is necessary to work with the wiring of the car, be sure to unplug it before working with it to make sure it is completely disconnected from the electrical system. Lastly, always wear safety equipment such as gloves and goggles when working on any type of car repair."

663,"Book recommendation, with the plot of a person who is always blamed at for everything, and how his/her mentality is affected by those traumas","Find the raised by narcissists sub, I bet people there will know. I can’t link.","

The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is a great book to explore this type of story line. It follows the story of Charlie, a seemingly typical teenager who is trying to cope with complex family dynamics, school life, and the growing pains of being a teenager. He starts off struggling with depression and intense feelings of loneliness and isolation, and finds solace in the understanding of his two friends, Sam and Patrick. But as the story progresses, Charlie gradually discovers the truth of his past –that he's been constantly blamed for his family's problems and was the scapegoat for traumatic events that happened over the years. This book explores the mindset of someone who is so used to blame and how it affects them in everyday life, and offers an interesting perspective on how people can cope in difficult situations."

666,"When lifting, is it important to have a fast concentric and slow eccentric?","Generally, yes. The concentric portion should be a little faster and the eccentric slower. There are people who will describe more precise parameters—e.g. 2 sec concentric, 4 sec eccentric—but that is not really important. 

IMO, having control of the weight throughout the ROM is the most important thing, rather than any strict timing. 

But, yes, you want to keep the weight under control during the eccentric (lowering) part of the movement, not just let it “drop”.","

Yes. Performing exercises with a quick concentric (lifting) movement and a slow eccentric (lowering) movement will help you maximize the amount of time under tension, which in turn can lead to greater strength gains and muscle gains. Additionally, it can help you improve your form and technique while avoiding potential injuries."
667,Why are Americans so obsessed with politics?,"> Never in my life have I ever seen another country so unbelievably obsessed with politics as American citizens are. Literally fights, verbal and physical abuse, 

Then I say you have not really been watching others.","

Americans are deeply invested in politics for a variety of reasons. The American system was designed to give citizens a strong say in how the government is run, so it's natural for citizens to take an interest in the inner workings of government. Additionally, political issues often directly influence the lives of everyday citizens, so staying informed about the political climate is paramount to making personal decisions. Finally, much of American culture is heavily defined by political conversations, identities, and narratives, making political discussion a natural part of life."

Fletcher had been deployed to monitor a demonstration against the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and died shortly afterwards. Her death resulted in an eleven-day siege of the embassy, at the end of which those inside were expelled from the country and the United Kingdom severed diplomatic relations with Libya.","

Yes, the host country could do something about it. If the embassy is located in the host country’s jurisdiction, it is bound by the same laws and regulations as everyone else and would not be above the law. The host country has the right to revoke the embassy’s diplomatic immunity if they believed it was necessary and to take legal action against the perpetrators of the shootings. The host country could also decide to remove the embassy from their jurisdiction altogether, as a final measure."

There is no definite answer to this question as it depends on personal preference and budget. If you are planning to surprise your wife with an engagement ring, think about her style and taste, and which ring will make her feel most special. You can consider any type of ring that appeals to you both, such as a diamond ring, a sapphire ring, or a unique design. Once you know what type of ring you want to give her, you should consider the cost and budget. Most rings range from a few hundred dollars up to thousands of dollars, so be sure to pick one that fits within your budget. Additionally, make sure that the ring is properly sized. If your partner is uncertain of her exact ring size, try getting a small, temporary ring to give her until it's properly sized. Finally, if you are able to get the ring engraved, this can make the gift even more special."
692,Does she feel anger towards me??,She's dumb and crazy .. AVOID HER .. she can accuse you of something and ruin your life!,"

That can't be answered without more information. It is impossible to know how someone is feeling without talking to them directly."
693,"After drinking, I slept for the same time without waking up, yet I'm so much more tired. How?",Alcohol does that. It takes a lot of energy to recover from a mild poisoning.,"

Alcohol can make you feel more tired because it is a depressant that reduces your energy levels. Your body is still using energy to metabolize the alcohol, which can make you feel tired even after sleeping for the same amount of time. Additionally, chronic alcohol use can affect your circadian rhythm, which can cause fatigue and difficulty sleeping even after drinking."
694,Could tik tok be a mass desensitization tool?,"Can you elaborate on what a ""desensitization tool"" is?","

It is possible that TikTok could be used as a mass desensitization tool if it is used to normalize otherwise marginalized subject matter. For example, by exposing people to different types of lifestyles, cultures, and attitudes, they can become more tolerant and understanding of others. However, it is important to note that this process is not as simple as just exposing people to different content, but rather requires thoughtful curation and guidance."
695,Should I have given him a chance?,"No, don't let anyone pressure you into a relationship if you think it wouldn't work.","

That is something that only you can decide. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide whether or not taking a chance on someone is the right choice for you."
696,How can I stop envying my boyfriend?,"Hi /u/Perfect_Statement_36,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

Envy is a feeling that is often rooted in feelings of insecurity or lack of self-esteem. In order to stop envying your boyfriend, it may be helpful to work on developing more self-confidence and recognizing and appreciating your own strengths and accomplishments. Spending some time focusing on activities and interests that bring you enjoyment and fulfillment can also help to build your self-esteem and boost your own sense of pride and accomplishment. Additionally, it can be helpful to practice accepting and embracing the successes of others without comparing them to your own. Spend time reflecting on why you envy your boyfriend and realizing that there is space to appreciate and admire his successes without diminishing your own."
697,Car Insurance More Expensive? UK,I think so. Try asking at r/askUK,"

Car insurance in the UK is typically more expensive than other parts of the world. This is largely due to the fact that the UK has more stringent car insurance laws and higher levels of traffic congestion. In addition, the UK also has higher levels of car crime than other parts of the world, which can push up premiums."
698,Would complimenting a bartender's tattoo be seen as flirting?,We need more details. Impossible to say rn.,"

It depends on the context and situation. If the comment is genuinely meant in a friendly, non-flirtatious way, then it would generally be seen as simply a compliment. If the comment includes more suggestive body language or language, then it might be perceived as flirting."
699,Would I be breaking any laws if I used Whisper AI to record and thus transcribe phone calls?,"Depends which state. If you live in a state which has two party consent laws, it would be illegal. If not, then it would not.","

No, you would not be breaking any laws by using Whisper AI to record phone calls. However, you may need to check with your local laws, as different countries and regions have different laws concerning the recording of phone calls. In many places, you may need to obtain the consent of the other party before you can record a phone call."
700,Outside of USA is there places in other countries that have American pockets?,"In many places in Asia and in Australia, American culture is already pretty ubiquitous, so it's less than they assimilate into our cultures and more we have assimilated theirs.

What would a Little America look like anyhow? Pizza and burger joints? Ribs & grill? We got that all over here already.

edit: one more thing, Americans don't immigrant, they expat. It's a different mindset that results less in establishing ethnic enclaves.","

Yes, there are many places in other countries that have American influences, which are often referred to as American pockets or enclaves. Examples include several islands in the Caribbean such as the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico; parts of Canada and western Europe; and more recently, the cities of Shanghai and Beijing, both of which have clusters of fast-food restaurants, American-style clothing stores, and big-box retailers."
701,U.S.A. Drone Flight Data,"[FlightAware](https://www.flightaware.com) is a good source, but I think you need to pay for historical data.

[They have instructions on how to build your own ADS-B receiver](https://www.flightaware.com/adsb/piaware/build/) if you want to setup your own flight monitoring near you.","

The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) maintains flight data, including information on drone flights, in an internal database. The FAA does not make this information publicly available, so an individual or organization cannot access drone flight data using publicly available data sources. However, some organizations can access FAA data directly through a public records request or by joining a data sharing program, such as the Data Exchange Program (DEP). Additionally, some organizations use data from other sources, such as private drone companies or local governments, to cross-reference and determine drone flight patterns."
702,When you live with someone does your bathroom habits sync up?,"I don't know, but my wife and I lived for quite a while in places with just a single bathroom, and it really was a problem.  So many years ago we finally moved into a house with 2.  And it was so much better.","

No, not typically. Everyone has their own bathroom habits and preferences."
703,Why do men think that pants that end two inches above the ankles is a good look?,what is good is subjective,"

Some men think that pants that end two inches above the ankles is a good look because it allows for their shoes to be more prominently displayed which many consider to be a fashionable and stylish look. Additionally, for those with athletic builds, ankle pants can elongate the legs, making them appear longer and leaner."
704,Is it too much to ask my landlord this?,"Absolutely say something! My partner and I started renting a home that wasn’t well cared for by the previous tenants & the property managers never checked it over before giving us the keys. Beyond many issues we’re still sorting out, we put maintenance requests in about the fridge (wasn’t keeping cold, leaked coolant) and dishwasher (heating element rusted, filter dirty beyond salvaging). We didn’t ask for replacements, but when the maintenance/appliance folks saw the photos, they told our management that both appliances needed to be replaced. So, now we have new appliances! As renters, we pay $$$ to landlords so they can handle these situations for us. Best of luck to you both!","

No, it is not too much to ask of your landlord. However, it is important to ensure that you are respectful and polite when communicating with your landlord and that your requests are reasonable."
705,How do you forgive yourself for messy mistakes in the past?,"First, were these actually ""mistakes""?  Or were they conscious bad acts/negligence/carelessness?

Consider dealing with what you did for what it is, rather than calling it an ooopsie as if you'd stepped on the dog's tail in the dark.

Then, learn this mantra:  *That was me THEN. THIS is me NOW.* And remind yourself that you've learned your lesson and never want to cringe about anything else anymore, so you're going to avoid making decisions as you did in the past.","

1. Acknowledge your mistakes without self-judgment. It is important to be honest about what you did, but to do it without punishing yourself. 

2. Forgive yourself. Talk to yourself the way you'd talk to a friend or loved one who made a mistake. Offer yourself the same kindness, understanding, and compassion. 

3. Take responsibility for your actions. Taking responsibility means that you are aware of what happened and of the consequences of your choices. Accepting your part in a situation shows self-respect and resilience, even in the face of mistakes. 

4. Learn from your mistakes. Ask yourself what you can learn from the situation and develop a plan to prevent making the mistake again. 

5. Move on. Take action to invest in your wellbeing and personal growth. This could include engaging in activities that make you feel good, develop new skills, or start a new project. "
706,What exactly is an eccentric character?,"""Eccentric"" Basically just means ""weird, but in a wealthy/charming way"".","

An eccentric character is a form of literary character who behaves or speaks in an unconventional way, often in a way that is considered to be odd or quirky. Eccentric characters often have unique and eccentric personalities and often come from strange and interesting backgrounds."
707,Can active duty soldiers from different armies get married?,"As far as I know, there shouldn't be any policies preventing them from getting married.","

Yes, active duty soldiers from different armies can get married. Depending on their home countries' laws and military regulations, they may need special permission or approvals. Depending on the countries and their respective military regulations, they may have to get married in a civilian setting in order for the marriage to be recognized."
708,"why do the early 1900s feel ""retro"" but the late 1800s (only a decade apart) feel like the middle ages?",They didn't have electricity. That's the main thing that differs from 18 to 1900.,"

The different eras and decades carry different cultural associations. The late 1800s are often associated with the Victorian era and the Middle Ages, which are seen as dark and unenlightened times due to the lack of modern conveniences and inventions. The early 1900s, in contrast, are often associated with the Edwardian era and the start of the industrial and modern eras, which have distinct aesthetic and cultural features. This carries a sense of nostalgia that is associated with the term 'retro'."
709,How would an object spinning at light speed work?,">the point 10m away must be moving at a much higher speed

For speeds that we encounter on a day-to-day basis, yes. For speeds that approach the speed of light, [velocity addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula) gets more complicated than 1+1=2. Time dilation makes the whole thing *very* unintuitive.

>Would I be prevented from spinning this quickly

In practice, attempting to spin that quickly would destroy you, or the stick, or both. I'll share a [relevant post from XKCD](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/) as an illustration of how ridiculous these scenarios can get.","

At the speed of light, objects become massless and much of the laws of nature no longer apply. Time and space become distorted, and the object itself would stretch and distort. At such speeds, the object would no longer occupy a three dimensional space, and its precise shape would be impossible to implicate. In addition, due to the laws of relativity, those viewing the object would observe time dilation, and the object would appear to move in slow motion or even pause completely."
710,If a 18 year old makes alcohol at home would they get in trouble even if the people drinking it are 21 or older,ABC will kick down your door and burn your house to the ground. You are safer cooking meth,"?

Yes, in many countries a person needs to be licensed in order to make and sell alcohol. It is against the law for an 18 year old to make or sell alcohol regardless of the age of the people consuming it."
711,"Why have coffee shops become positively bare, uncomfortable, and often dirty spaces recently?",So people will stop camping out there?,"

Coffee shops have become positively bare, uncomfortable, and often dirty spaces recently for a few reasons. One reason could be that with the rise of social media, people are choosing to take photos of their coffee in a sleek and minimalist space. To appeal to this trend, coffee shops are choosing to invest more in minimalist decor and furniture, at the cost of comfort. Additionally, many coffee shops are operating on a lower budget due to shrinking margins due to increased competition. This can lead to less frequent cleanings and less attention to maintenance, making the spaces more uncomfortable and dirty."
712,How do you avoid that awkward half-cheek-kiss-half-hug when you’re not sure if your family is going for a hug or a cheek kiss or both?,let them come to you then and see what they do,"

The best way to avoid feeling awkward is to be explicit and ask. For example, you could say something like, “Do you want a hug or a kiss?” or even “What kind of greeting would you like?”. This way everyone will be clear on the expectations and it will reduce any potential awkwardness."
713,Should your savings go up in value?,It depends on what you are saving.,"

Yes, the value of your savings can go up or down depending on current market conditions."
714,How do I find shows that both me and my dad will like?,"It’s your dad, surely there’s something on his list that is moderately interesting to you? Watch that. 

Some of the cooking competitions are kinda fun. I’ll enjoy Chopped or Beat Bobby Flay.","

One of the best ways to find shows that both you and your dad will like is to research what type of shows you both usually like. Then look for shows that may meet both of your criteria or try watching something from your dad’s favorite genre and see if you both enjoy it. You can also search for top rated shows that have elements of both of your preferred genres. Additionally, you can check out streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime to find new shows with a wide variety of genres that you both can enjoy together."
715,Using Peppermint Castile Soap To Repel Bugs,"You can do this because it won’t hurt you, but I wouldn’t recommend using soap as it’ll leave a film on everything. 

Using peppermint-oil solution would be better, although that, too, might leave marks. You need just a few drops in a spray bottle of distilled water — shake every time you use it, and test on a hidden spot if you’re going to spray it on fabric. 

You can also probably use peppermint extract/water, but the extract isn’t as strong as the oil.","

Using Peppermint Castile Soap can be a great way to repel bugs due to its natural bug-repelling properties. This natural bug repellent can be used directly on skin as a topical solution, or diluted in water and sprayed around areas you would like to keep bug-free. The strong peppermint scent will help ward off bugs, and the soapy solution will help to make them move away."
716,"I'm curious- what do orgasms feel like for other women? Ladies, can you describe your different types of orgasms?",Damnn. It's just the sexual sighing with squirting for us men. 🥹,"

Orgasm can feel different for different women; it can sometimes be difficult to put into words. However, some common descriptions of orgasms are pleasurable sensations that are intense and often localized in the genital area, though they can be felt throughout the body. Other women interpret them as an overwhelming wave of pleasure, a fluttering sensation, a tingling feeling, an energy surge, a sudden burst of warmth, or pleasurable pulsations in the genitals. In regard to different types of orgasms, women often experience clitoral orgasms (arousal from stimulation of the clitoris often resulting in strong contractions), vaginal orgasms (arousal from pressure within the vaginal and orgasm from penetration, or deep muscle contractions), and multiple orgasms (a series of orgasms occurring over a short period of time). Again, the sensations are highly individual, so experimentation and self-exploration are key for each woman to discover how they experience orgasm personally."
717,How do I deal with someone triggered by something I said or did?,"If this happens a lot, it sounds like you're the one who doesn't know how to be professional.","

If someone is triggered by something you said or did, the first step is to apologize for what was said or done. From there, it's important to take responsibility for your actions and show genuine empathy for the individual who is now feeling triggered. After this, if it is appropriate, provide an explanation for why you said or did what you did and take that individual's feedback into consideration when making future decisions. It's important to be patient and respectful when addressing a situation such as this."
718,Propane: Is it common for people to use PVC pipe for the supply line from the propane tank to the house?,Never.,"

Yes, PVC pipe is very commonly used for the supply line from the propane tank to the house. PVC pipes offer flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and are available in various sizes, making it easier for homeowners to select the suitable pipe for their particular project."
719,Is the sun’s path taken into consideration when building an open-top stadium?,"It is. And they purposely put the visiting team in on the worse side. It’s unfair. It’s on purpose.

Tbh idk if your exact example is even unfair or consistently unfair depending on the time of day. But that kind of thing does happen in general. In cold weather outdoor stadiums away teams would often be in shade that was way colder than the home teams side.","

Yes, the sun's path can be taken into consideration when designing an open-top stadium, particularly when deciding the best location for the stadium and which direction the seating should face. This helps to avoid issues with sun glare and shadows that could affect the visibility of the players and the action on the field."
720,Can someone help me come up with a cool username using my name? Its Daryle,"Hi /u/NoSatisfaction6751,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

721,"Why do I ALWAYS get hungry, then fall asleep ASAP.","If I’m understanding this correctly, you smoke, then eat a whole bunch, and then fall asleep. 

This is completely normal. I’m assuming you’re talking about smoking weed. In that case, both intense cravings/hunger and tiredness are symptoms of a being high. Smoking often makes people really hungry, this is called the munchies. Being high can also make you really tired/drowsy.","

It could be that you are not eating enough food throughout the day to give you sustained energy. When you feel hungry, your body is telling you that you need food to get the fuel it needs to carry out regular functions. If you’re not getting enough food and nutrients, you’ll likely tire out quickly, hence why you often fall asleep. Try to make sure you’re eating several small healthy meals throughout the day to keep your energy levels up."
722,If the mods were paid would they be better?,"If it was a paid position, there'd be a lot more oversight, accountability, actual job descriptions and requirements, etc. 

Having said that, while mods don't get paid in actual money, there have been times when mods were in fact compensated. This involves reddit hosting mod get-togethers for all mods in a specific city, subscriptions to other websites, etc.","

No, paying mods would not necessarily make them better. The job of a moderator is predominantly one of voluntary service and many of them give up their time for the betterment of the community they are part of. A mod's effectiveness is dependent on a number of factors such as experience, knowledge, and commitment to the community."
723,If we can modify organisms to do all sorts of things why can't we create ocean going anti yeast and then let it grow,"There is an idea to dump phosphorus into the oceans, causing algae blooms, which captures co2, and sink to the bottom.  It's been tested, but would require billions of dollars of phosphorus, with no financial return."," and battle the slick

Unfortunately, it's not possible to create an anti-yeast that will battle a slick. Yeasts are microscopic organisms that cannot exist and survive in the open ocean. Slick is a type of pollution created by oil spills, and although microorganisms can help break down the oil, yeast is not one of them. New organisms and bacteria are being studied to help clean up oil spills, but they do not yet exist in nature and are not available yet for research and development."
724,"I just found out my best friend (f) friend is in love with me (f) through her brother, after 10 years of being friends. She’s about to get married next month to her boyfriend of 4 years. Should i confront her or let it be?","Wait. Your best friend is in love with you but about to be married to someone she's dated for 4 years and you got this info second hand? If she was in love with you she would tell you herself, no questions asked. Even so, are you going to break up a relationship because of it? How do you feel about her? I would just be supportive of her choices, honestly. If she wanted you she'd be with you.","

That is a tough situation. It is important to consider your own feelings and emotions before deciding the best course of action. It sounds like your friend is about to get married, so it might not be the ideal time to have this conversation. You should think about how this would make you feel and consider how it could impact your friendship if you do decide to bring it up. If you decide to talk to your friend, make sure it is done in a private and respectful manner. It would also be a good idea to talk to her brother and let him know that you are aware of his sister's feelings. You should also make sure that your friend knows that you care for her and that you respect her relationship with her boyfriend. The decision to confront her or let it be is ultimately yours. Whatever you decide to do, try to make sure to handle the situation with care and empathy."
725,"Why do those interviewing candidates for a mid-level job look either depressed, like a robot, or trying to hard to be composed and happy?","Generally it’s extremely stressful. You usually have to fit 20 interviews into your schedule, follow a very mundane repeatable process, keep impeccable notes for legal discovery in case somebody cries foul play, and justify your choice to the next scrutinizing asshole up the food chain.","

Job interviews can be a stressful experience for both the interviewer and interviewee. The interviewer may be trying to appear composed and professional, but his or her demeanor may still reflect some anxiety or underlying tension. Interviewers may also be feeling the pressure to find the best candidate for the position and may be questioning their own capabilities to make the right decision. Additionally, many interviewers have limited interview experience and may feel overwhelmed or unsure of themselves during the process. Additionally, some interviewers may feel like they have to put on a “happy face” during the interview, even if they don’t genuinely feel that way."
726,Is this scabbing?,"No, because you're not replacing the workers to the benefit of the employers.","

No, scabbing usually refers to the formation of a hard crust over a wound or sore during the healing process. It is a protective measure against infection and often consists of dried blood and other fluids. This pictures appears to show dry skin which is not scabbing."
727,Are men's cologne commercials geared toward men or women ?,its mostly to appeal to guys who strive to live/look/be that conmercial man. and maybe women who what that of their man. all ads are meant to just live rent free in peoples head anyhow,"

Men's cologne commercials are often geared toward both men and women. They tend to target men who wish to improve their appeal to a potential female partner, as well as women who are looking for the perfect gift for a man in their life."
728,Is Tesla build quality really not great?,Yeah Tesla build quality and QC are pretty embarrassing at the price point of those cars. It's the sort of stuff you'd expect on bargain basement compact cars or budget Chinese imports.,"

The build quality of Tesla vehicles has been improving over time. In recent years, Tesla's build quality continues to become better, as more models are being released with improved material and better craftsmanship. In general, consumer reviews suggest that Tesla vehicles are of above-average build quality. However, some purchasers report experiencing some quality-control issues or reliability problems."
729,Am I the only one that gets turned off by incessant targeted marketing?,You aren't alone. I see this same basic question posted frequently. But such advertising does work on enough people to be profitable.,"

No, you are not. Many people find targeted marketing to be intrusive and irritating."
730,how do i do this?,"I had this exact same conundrum last year with a guy I liked who I’d make very brief eye contact with constantly and said maybe five words total to him. On the paper I was going to give to him, I just said that I thought he was really cute and listed some of the things I liked about him. I wrote how he gave me butterflies and how much I wanted to be with him. Then I just signed my name and wrote down my number. I was planning on setting it on his desk as soon as I walked into class one day, as he was always in class by the time I arrived. Unfortunately, I never worked up the courage and now I’ve graduated so I may never get the chance to actually confess to him. Don’t make the same mistake I did!","

To do this, you will need to decide what content you want to include, create a document that outlines the content and define a structure for the website, and choose a website development platform that works for you. You will then need to use the tools provided by the website development platform to design and build the website, including coding, setting up hosting, creating visuals, and designing the website's navigation. Finally, you will need to test and launch the website."
731,Problems with USPS?,"In my experience, it's been an issue with the distribution center. We had some issues here in my neck of the woods for a while last year. A lot of returned mail. Folks were pissed. Hopefully your stuff gets to you soon, buddy","

1. Lack of reliable tracking and delivery information: Tracking systems are often inaccurate or up-to-date information is not available.

2. Delivery delays: This has become an increasing issue, as mail is increasingly taking longer to reach its destination.

3. Lost packages: Packages occasionally become lost in transit and are never delivered.

4. Poor customer service: Many customers complain about long wait times and unhelpful customer service representatives when attempting to resolve delivery issues.

5. Inadequate staffing: This leads to understaffed postal facilities, resulting in longer wait times and slower delivery times."
732,I have a friend (29f) that has a boyfriend. But I think she has a syndrome that makes her look like 12 years old (physically) do you think that makes the guy a pedophile ??,"I think you're way too preoccupied by physical appearance and trying to read other people's minds.

You may even be projecting.","

No, it does not automatically make the guy a pedophile. It is possible that the guy loves your friend and does not view her as a child. Pedophilia goes far beyond physical appearance into a person's psychology, so it is not right to assume the guy is a pedophile."
733,Hollywood writers strike,"Two main things. The first was the question of residuals when it comes to streaming. Writers in the past have negotiated lower pay in exchange for residuals. Since writing is a volatile field, even accomplished writers may be out of work for months at a time between shows. This is why residuals where worth it over a lower pay rate. That way if you had a successful show that tends to run reruns, you have consistent income even between jobs. The problem is that since we are moving more and more towards streaming, residuals dont really make sense the way they used to. A big part of the negotiation are about new ways to calculate residuals that make sense with modern streaming.

The other big problem is that writing for a streaming service sort of sucks. There has been a big push to make writing more like the gig economy. Where writers are rotated between projects with very little long term prospects. There are jobs to be had, but the expectation is that those jobs dont last more than a few months by design. Obviously volatile employment is nothing new to writers, but the dream of writing for a long term successful show is becoming more and more elusive. Even if you do write for a successful show, you still cant build a career out of it.

These are the big issues.","

The Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) and the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) authorized a strike by Hollywood writers against the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) on November 5, 2007. The 16-week strike began on November 5, underscoring the issues the Guild had with how writers were receiving compensation for DVD residuals, web and mobile media, and streaming media. The strike officially ended on February 12, 2008, when both the WGAE and WGAW announced the ratification of their side of the agreement. This resulted in a new three-year contract, which included a bonus payment from film studios of more than $200 million to be given to current and former WGA members."
734,"What is it called when you have a temporary habit of doing something constantly like biting your lip, grinding your teeth, clenching your jaw, etc. ?",tic,"

This type of behavior is commonly referred to as a habit tic or habitual tic."
735,"(Not American) How can servers get paid under minimum wage without tips, isn't the whole point of minimum wage that you can't get paid less than it?",But they do get tips so they do make at least minimum wage. If they didn't get tips then they'd be paid minimum wage. They like tips because it usually gets them considerably more than minimum wage,"

Unfortunately, the answer to this question varies depending on the country or region. In some areas, minimum wage laws are not strictly enforced and servers in restaurants can get paid less than the minimum wage as long as tips make up the difference between their wages and the minimum wage. In other cases, servers are paid a base salary plus tips, but this doesn't always mean that they will be paid the full minimum wage. In any situation, employers should always be aware of the local minimum wage laws and comply with them."

739,Were there people who hated specifically swords like people who hate firearms today?,"Sort of?

There were plenty of sword laws and sword bans.","

Yes, throughout history there have been people who have disliked, feared, or even hated swords - particularly swords wielded as weapons of war. During the 19th century, sword-haters believed that swords and similar weapons such as knives had become outmoded by the development of firearm technology, and so should be abolished from military combat. Similarly today, some people may dislike swords due to feelings of unease or even fear, or because they object to swords' use as weapons."
740,is there any developmental effects from watching gore as a kid?,If you have to ask you already know the answer.,"

Yes. Researchers have found that exposure to violent or graphic content at a young age can have a negative effect on the development of children. Possible effects include increased aggression, desensitization to violence and suffering, risk-taking behavior, and difficulty forming healthy emotional bonds."
741,"Im dutch but speak english close to, or even at a native level, is there any career for this?","Not really. According to Google, it's estimated that 90% of Dutch people are proficient in English so you're par for the course. Being proficient in English as a European is an expectation depending on what kind of job you'll have, so you'll have to develop some other sort of skill to be competitive.","

Yes, certainly. If you have a knack for languages, you may want to consider a career as a translator or interpreter. There are also many opportunities for people who speak multiple languages to work in education, customer service, and travel industries. Additionally, many companies look to hire people who can help them reach a multicultural customer base. You may also want to consider a career in journalism or writing, as many publications are always looking for people who can contribute in English."
742,How is possible to be slow at running?,I look forward to the day you announce your 3-minute mile.   Just keep moving your legs faster.,"

There are a few ways in which one can be slow at running. Depending on their physical abilities, running slowly may be due to poor fitness, conditioning, lack of proper technique, or even poor diet and nutrition. Additionally, some medical conditions may cause a person to have difficulty running at higher speeds."
743,How can water be wasted if it goes through the water cycle?,"Water in reservoirs around Albany New York don't help people in Algeria who are in drought.     The water cycle doesn't drop water back where you need it - most of it goes into the ocean where is remains undrinkable.   

If you're in Algeria and you fill up your kiddy pool, water your lawn, wash your car, and take 30 minute showers, you are wasting a limited resource.    The rain falling in other places like Albany, NY means the total of water on Earth stays the same, but that balance won't help you stay alive any longer.","

Water can be wasted as it goes through the water cycle by becoming polluted, over-consumed, or evaporating away before being used for beneficial purposes. Pollution occurs when chemicals or other pollutants enter the water supply, over-consumption occurs when too much water is taken from a source, and evaporation can occur when water is not replenished or used quickly enough."
744,"Why do Atlantic coastal states (FL, SC, NC, VA, MD) have lots of popular beaches but Georgia doesn’t?",Beaches are not easily accessible in Georgia.  The best beaches  are in marshes.,"

The Atlantic coast states of Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland have a relatively high degree of shoreline exposure compared to Georgia. This means that the states have more coastlines that face the Atlantic Ocean which allows for more opportunities to develop beaches with public access. Additionally, many of the Atlantic coast states have made a concerted effort to attract investment and funding to create public beaches, which further increases the number of beaches in the region. In comparison, Georgia has only limited portions of its coastline that directly face the Atlantic Ocean, and the state has not made as significant investments in creating public beaches."
745,"Non-native English speakers, how the hell did you learn when to use the prepositions ""in"" and ""on"" when there's no grammatical rule/guide for them?","Well I can't say for everyone, but atleast for me, once you get familiar with the language, you can kind of guess which one to use. Idk, if this makes sense to you? 
How I learned english is mostly due exposure to the english language. I grew up watching a lot of english/american shows. Or even anime where the spoken language would be japanese but the subtitles in english. So as I grew up with this kind of exposure, you automatically get familiar with for example, in this case, prepositions that don't really have any grammatical ruling. That aside, if I did make mistakes, I still got corrected when I was in secondary school as english (it was standard british english though) was and still is a mandatory class you have to take. 

That aside, what also might be the reason is because I'm from a country where we have multiple official languages. So I already got exposed to a different language outside my native one from a young age in school( I'm talking about 8-9 years old, that would be 3rd grade for you guys right?). So I might pickup those grammatical rulings (that technically don't make any sense) in languages faster than maybe other people who never really got exposed to a different language from a young age.","

There is a general guideline that can help you decide when to use “in” vs. “on.” Generally, you use “in” when talking about something contained within a larger area, while you use “on” when referring to something located on the surface of something else. For example, if you are describing something that is inside a house, you would use the preposition “in,” e.g. “the plate is in the kitchen.” Similarly, if you are describing something that is on top of a table, you would use the preposition “on,” e.g. “the flowers are on the table.”

In addition, practice makes perfect! The more you use the proper preposition in the right contexts, the more comfortable you become with them. Once you get comfortable, it will become automatic and you won’t need to think about it anymore. Therefore, make sure you pay attention to how native English speakers use these prepositions and try to emulate their examples."
746,whats stopping us from putting waste under water,other than us poisoning the oceans is a bad thing?,"

Putting waste under water could have serious environmental impacts and can pollute the water, threatening aquatic life and habitats. It could also have a negative effect on human health - a risk that should never be taken. Additionally, there are storage and access issues. Wastes may need to be extracted and picked up from the water surface if they need to be treated or disposed of differently."
747,Can a vampire enter your home with a warrant?,"The way it's usually expressed is that a vampire can't enter the home uninvited. Ownership of the home isn't the point. The point is that it's your home, and your home is your castle. This leads me to think that (A) another invited guest doesn't have the authority to issue invitations but that (B) the courts do have that authority, within the limits of the law.

If the vampire is a cop or other official acting under a court order in his official capacity, I think he can enter the house uninvited. But only to do what the warrant specifies.","

No, vampires cannot enter your home with a warrant. Warrants are issued by the court system, and vampires do not have any legal authority in the human court system."
748,What if all animals could communicate and understand humans?,"If they're also intelligent enough to understand humans, I imagine the world would get taken over by an ant supercolony.","

If all animals could communicate and understand humans, it would be a major breakthrough in understanding our own planet. We could learn about animals in ways we never thought possible by communicating with them directly. We could learn about their habitats, needs, and behaviors, allowing us to better protect them. We would also gain a deeper understanding of their unique perspective and gain knowledge that can be used to improve the health and well-being of all species. Additionally, it would create a unique opportunity for unique bonds and understanding between humans and animals, with the potential to create lasting peace between us."
749,"If you are traveling at .99c, in a void with nothing relative of your position, and you shine a light in front of you. That light will move away relative from you at 1c. Are you still technically moving at .99c?","The speed of light is a constant.  It's always measured as the speed of light relative to all observers.  

You see the light moving away from you at 1c.  

The starting point observer sees you moving away from them at 0.99c and the light moving away from your ship relative to them at 1c.  They see the light moving away from your ship at 0.01c.  

You see, when you look back at the starting point observer's clock it's running slow from your point of view.  When they look at yours it is yours running slow from their point of view.  You measure the distance you've travelled as shorter than the starting point observer does.  They measure your ship as being shorter than you do.  And so on and so forth.  All of this adds up to everyone seeing the speed of light as a constant.","

No, you are not still moving at .99c. The speed of light is a universal constant, so since the light is moving away from you at the speed of 1c, you have to be moving either faster or slower than .99c."
750,Helpful info drug testing!!!!,"Cannabis generally will not stay in your system longer than a week, for urine tests.","

Drug testing is a way for employers and other organizations to determine if someone has been using drugs. A number of methods can be used including urine testing, hair testing, blood testing, and saliva testing. It is important to understand the different testing methods and your rights before submitting to a drug test."
751,Did our taste change to enjoy meat or did meat already taste good,"Evolution favors nutrient-dense food.

Meat is very high in protein, often high in fat and calories.

So yes, humans likely always liked meat.","?

The evidence suggests that our taste for meat has evolved over time and that the taste for meat was already present in early humans. This may have developed due to the high nutritional value of meat and the availability of meat as a food source."
752,Why so I always need to have a crush on someone?,Why so I always need a grammar make sense do?,"

That feeling of having or wanting a crush is completely normal, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be a romantic interest. A crush can be a sign of appreciation you have for someone or something. Everyone experiences different kinds of crushes but choosing to act on a crush is totally up to you. "
753,How long have barbers been doing Hard Parts?,"Whats the question? 

How long have they been doing it? No one knows because it wasnt important enough to document its history, but it was starting to reach popularity in the early, mid, and late 1900s. Middle parts have been a thing for a very very very long time though, dating to ancient civilization

Or is the question does anyone else think the same? I dont personally because i never really thought about it, cant speak for other people","

The Hard Part hairstyle, which has been popular among African-American men since the early 1900s, has been around since barbershops opened. The barbering technique of making a thick line going straight down the middle of a man's head using a clipper and a comb dates back to the early 20th century."
754,What CPU is the best value for 4K video editing and 3D rendering?,Maybe try /r/buildmeapc,"

The best CPU for 4K video editing and 3D rendering is the AMD Ryzen 9 3900X. This is an excellent value for the price, as it is able to offer exceptional performance for a relatively reasonable price. It has 12 cores and 24 threads, making it perfect for running intensive tasks like 4K video editing and 3D rendering. The Ryzen 9 3900X also supports PCIe 4.0, which can help improve performance when utilizing GPUs."
755,What does ‘3 minutes to yesterday’ mean?,I have never heard this before. Is it possible you misheard?,"

‘3 minutes to yesterday’ is a phrase used to metaphorically refer to a moment that is just out of reach or seemed to have occurred a short time ago, but it is impossible to return to. The phrase is often used to illustrate how quickly time can pass."
756,Car Insurance fraud?,"(1) Get on the insurance.  If you are in a US state, your state's motor vehicle department may suspend your license & registration if you have a registered car / good tags, but do not have insurance.  Let them know you are not driving, and turn in your plates/tags if you need to until you get insurance.   

(2) Do you really have the paperwork and evidence to go back over things from 2021?   You're going to have to convince the other person's insurance company to reopen the case and pay for things.   In some states, things are ""no - fault"", so each side pays their own damages.    For you to overturn this, you probably need to show more than just a communication error.  You almost certainly got a letter when it was over, showing all your insurance paid.   
You would need to show that your insurer did not pay for your rental, and/or convince the other side to pay for the rental and any other expenses your insurer had.   

(3) Insurance ""points"" are different than motor vehicle record points.    The insurance companies know if we plea down a speeding ticket - we still get insurance points.   They assign points if we are in an accident, and more points if they have to pay.    Every insurer gets to make up their own point system.   

Good luck.","

Insurance fraud is a type of fraud that involves falsifying or exaggerating information related to an insurance policy in order to obtain an undeserved payment or financial benefit from an insurer. Insurance fraud can be committed by both policyholders and providers of insurance services, including brokers, agents, health care providers, third-party claims processors, and insurers themselves. Some of the most common types of insurance fraud include phantom vehicles, staged accidents, exaggerated claims, inflated medical bills, fake or stolen property claims, and premium fraud."
757,"People over 30, do you ever feel like a loser for still renting? Obviously I know the economy, but I can't help how I feel sometimes.","No.  We bought a home at 30, sold at 42 and agreed we didn't want to own.","

No, you should not feel like a loser for renting. In many areas across the country, it is not always possible for people to purchase a home even if they wanted to, due to the cost or lack of availability of homes to buy. Additionally, a lot of people in their 30s prefer the benefits of renting over the responsibilities of homeownership. Ultimately, it is up to you to determine your financial goals and determine whether renting or buying is the right choice for you."
758,Do you add water to a crock pot pork tenderloin if so how much?(cooking beginner here),I prefer apple juice and I cover about half.,"

No, you do not need to add any additional water to a pork tenderloin in a crock pot. The natural juices released from the pork should be enough to keep it moist while cooking."
759,"Is it possible for your body to have problems regulating your chemicals, whereby consuming alcohol fixes the problem?","Alcohol doesn't regulate body chemistry in any way, so . . . No. That's not to say that the effects of alcohol can never have a beneficial effect. But alcohol never cures a problem.","

No, it is not possible for your body to have problems regulating its chemicals, which could be fixed by consuming alcohol. Alcohol should never be used as a treatment for any medical condition."

763,Universe-Designed Food Measurement,No. You’d have to look into it with a lot more detail than you could do outside of a lab to know if it was a gmo or whatever other worry you have is. Get it from your own garden from seeds you chose yourself if that’s what you want. Although there’s such little difference between things being breed with cross breeding or selective breeding or manhandled scientific breeding that a lab might not even be able to tell wherever you’re drawing your line.," Tool

This food measurement tool would include a camera and a scale, and would be used to accurately measure the amount of food (or food components) in a dish. The camera and scale would be hooked up to an app, which would allow users to take a photo of the food and use the scale to weigh the total amount of food. The app would then use a database of food measurements to accurately categorize the food into portion sizes, depending on how many servings the user would like to measure. The app would also include the option to convert measurements based on cup sizes, tablespoon amounts, etc."
764,"I i clone a hard drive, would I need to update paths?","If it is truly cloned, no. A proper clone should be identical in all ways to the previous one. Therefore, the paths would all be identical.

The only difference to the software or the computer should be the capacity of the new drive. This should have zero impact on any software or hardware except for the exact capacity is important.","

Yes, you would need to update any file paths when cloning a hard drive. You will have to update the file paths so that the software and applications are looking for the correct files in the correct locations. Additionally, you may need to make other changes depending on the exact setup of the original hard drive."
765,Too much oil?,No worries. You can consume quite a bit of olive oil before it becomes an issue.,"

When it comes to cooking, too much oil can result in food that is greasy, burned, or unappetizing. When using oil to fry food, be sure to monitor the temperature of the oil and use the correct amount for the recipe."
766,Perpetual energy?,"I apologize. Perpetual energy was a bit of a premature thought. I'm aware of the loss of energy but for argument sake, wouldn't such a setup with for an extended period of time? Something like an ice box/cooler that would be able to keep items cold for longer and occasionally need to be powered/recharged?","

Perpetual energy is energy that can be generated and used indefinitely without running out or needing to be replenished. It does not exist as a practical, usable source of energy today, although there are some technologies that may come close – such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydropower."
767,"If you cook chicken broth in quinoa instead of plain water, will it taste good or just not taste right afterwards?","Plenty of times, depending on my tastes that day.

It doesn't do anything particularly unexpected. Just makes the quinoa taste a little chicken-y, which is precisely what you'd expect.","

Cooking chicken broth in quinoa can taste good. It will add more flavor and depth to the quinoa. However, it may have an off taste afterwards depending on the type of broth and quantity used."

No, this is not a predator."
770,Does the US have a major problem with abandoned pets?,"The US?!

As an American who's spent years abroad I've got to laugh at that. Other countries have so many stray animals that they're not even interesting conversation at a bar.

You see posts about it specifically because abandoned pets are so rare here. You've let social media twist your head completely backwards.","

Yes, abandoned pets is a major problem in the US. According to the ASPCA, approximately 6.5 million companion animals enter shelters in the US every year, with 3.3 million being cats and 3.2 million being dogs. Of these, an estimated 1.5 million are euthanized each year."

During a moment's silence, people typically stand with their heads bowed in respect, offering a time of reflection or contemplation to remember those who have passed away, those who have made sacrifices, or to honor or commemorate a particular cause, event, or person. Some people may pray or offer words of silent reflection."
773,Can a military track it's OWN stealth aircraft?,"Yes they can track all of their vehicles and weapons with GPS and other systems.

Otherwise if you created a stealth fleet and couldn't track them the moment you built them or launched them you'd lose them pretty much. Kind of like that Batman movie with his stealth helicopter thing and they make a comment of remembering where are you parked it.","

Yes, it can. Many of today's stealth fighters and bombers are equipped with radar-detecting devices that allow military personnel to track them even when they are flying in a stealthy, low-radar-observable mode."
774,How do I politely deal with customers who won’t stop talking to me?,"“Next in line, please”.  

Hopefully the chatty Cathys will get the hint that there’s other people waiting","

If a customer won't stop talking to you, try using verbal cues like changing your body posture, using direct language, and providing short, polite responses. If that doesn't work, politely ask them if they have any additional questions or concerns, and suggest they contact the customer service team for further assistance if necessary. You may also kindly explain that you need to attend to other customers and ask if you can help them in any other way."

777,Why is American football so popular?,"Think about all the reasons why association football is popular.

American football is popular for the same reasons.

The military thing doesn't have much to do with it. And some states have multiple teams, so the idea of states rivaling each other doesn't seem spot-on.","

American football is popular for several reasons. It is seen as a sport of strategy, where the players must work together to outsmart and outplay their opponents, and its physical intensity and fast-paced nature have a high appeal. The length of each game (typically 1–2hrs), frequent stoppages for replays, and commercial breaks during games all help build anticipation and excitement and hold viewers’ attention. Finally, American football has deep roots in many American communities, with nearly every high school and college having their own teams, and these local teams can draw large crowds of supporters."
778,How do I know if high school is teaching me everything they should in STEM education? How can I augment my education?,You can read for your own interest.  The library is full of stuff that covers those topics.,"

It is important to keep in mind that the offerings of your high school in terms of STEM education may vary depending on your location and the resources available. Talk to your teachers or department heads to get a sense of what you are being taught, and what opportunities exist to take advanced courses. Additionally, you can also look for extracurricular programs in the area or online that will help you build your STEM knowledge and skills. Joining a robotics team, coding club, and/or a girls in STEM initiative, taking a summer course at a local university or community college, or seeking out online resources such as Coursera, edX, and Code Academy are all great ways to supplement your knowledge and skills in STEM."
779,"When they say that somewhere is guarded, what do they mean?","They aren't going to tell us specifics.  

They usually use layers of security.   Fences & walls,  cameras, live security people,  gates with restricted access,  secondary gates & doors,  more cameras,  limited access to keys or swipe cards,  requiring everyone - even your own boss to show their ID,   snipers in surrounding buildings,  drones or satellites watching traffic patterns,  devices to monitor sewers, mirrors to monitor cell phones or radio traffic in the area - and several other steps.   

Back in the late 80s, I was on a security team that watched about 200 cameras around lower NYC during the overnight & morning rush hour.   They created games for us to keep us alert.  One game would be someone with a special sign on a backpack.   Once a week, they'd come through unannounced during our shift.  The first person who found them would get an extra 30 minutes added to lunch that day, plus a $50 Savings Bond.    If someone else missed that person through 3 of their assigned zones, they'd lose 30 minutes from their lunch.  (We had a 1 hour paid lunch)","

When something is said to be ""guarded,"" it means that it is being watched or protected, usually by a person or group of people. This could also mean that the area is tightly restricted and kept safe from outside threat."
780,Anyone here ever been to the Trees of Mystery in Northern California?,That’s the place with the giant Paul  Bunyan and Babe the blue ox statues? It just seems like a place to sell curios and souvenirs.,"

781,What app or service will you never use again and why?,"AltaVista.

Miss you my dude. I always thought you were better than Google, but the rest of the world didn't agree. /teardrop","

I will never use Uber again because of the company's lack of transparency and poor customer service. The company has been accused of exploiting its drivers and various other unethical practices, and I believe their services are not worth supporting."
782,Yankees and beer,"What's a yankee? You don't mean the baseball team, do you?","

Yes, the New York Yankees and beer go together. Beer is sold at Yankee Stadium in the concourse areas, and at select locations on the Promenade, Field, and Terrace levels. Fans can purchase domestic beers, imports, and craft beers."

Most people will wear a watch on either their left or right wrist depending on their preference. Mobile phones are typically carried in either the pocket or a bag."
784,Older brother barely talks to me any more; how can we reconnect?,"Sounds like therapy could help him more than you ever could. Obviously you can’t force him to to that.

Does he have any hobbies? Maybe you could invite him out to do things that are related to his interests? I would try to take him to free events or out in nature, so there wouldn’t be any embarrassment if he couldn’t pay his own way. 

Or invite him to out with mutual friends, or groups of people. Just show some sort of interest in spending time together that has nothing to do with his “future” or starting some business with him. 

It sounds like everything he worked so hard for in his adult life came crashing down around him. He needs to rebuild his confidence, and feel valued as a person for who he is and what he has accomplished. Not constantly reminded of his failures.","

It can be challenging to reestablish connections with a sibling who has distanced themselves. The first step may be to reach out directly and express your desire to reconnect. It can be difficult to have a meaningful conversation in person, so you may want to try some other avenues first. Consider texting them, writing a letter, or sending a meaningful card. These small gestures may be enough to start a conversation. It may also help to focus on shared interests and memories. Reminisce about inside jokes, shared adventures, or times that you felt especially connected. Spending time together in person can also be beneficial—if that’s an option. You may also want to take some time to reflect on why the relationship changed, and how it can be improved going forward. Communication is key, so make sure to be open and honest with your sibling and make sure to express your feelings in a respectful way."
785,Rebuilding cars?,A lot of parts are not interchangeable.,"

Rebuilding cars is a complex process that requires time, skill, and knowledge. Depending on the extent of the rebuild you may need to remove, repair, and/or replace certain parts, such as the engine, suspension, and exterior body panels. Additionally, you may need to replace or upgrade interior components, such as the upholstery, electronics, and audio. A professional mechanic or car enthusiast is typically recommended to handle the job, though some may attempt to do some of the simpler steps, such as sanding paint or installing wiring."
786,Is asking an obese person if they go to the gym considered fat shaming?,"Are you doing it because they're fat or because you want their company at gym? If it's the former, it's fat shaming. Not your business, move on.","

Yes, it is considered fat shaming as it implies that the person should be doing more to change their physical appearance and insinuates that they are not doing enough."

No, that is something that only you and your boyfriend can discuss and work out together. It would be best to communicate openly and honestly with your boyfriend about your concerns in order to address the underlying causes of his behavior."
788,"Recovering alcoholics, when did you realize that you needed help?","Was working from home during COVID a few months into a new job. Was making dumb mistakes and getting chewed out for it. I was getting hammered every night and getting poor sleep, leading to making those dumb mistakes. Also, my sex drive tanked and I got fat due to developing low T. Swore off booze and never looked back.","

The tipping point for me was when I started to no longer enjoy the feeling of drinking, and it began to take a toll on my physical, emotional, and mental health. Seeing how my relationships with family and friends were deteriorating was also an eye-opener. Once I realized I was in over my head, I chose to reach out for help."
789,If athesists dont believe in an after life why dont they just become heroin or alcohol addicts so they can achieve the most pleasure before they die?,not having an afterlife gives one more incentive not to die doing things like massive amounts of heroin,"

It would be impossible to predict beforehand if the pleasure one would achieve through becoming a heroin or alcohol addict would outweigh the risks involved in such a lifestyle. Atheists typically follow the same rule of thumb when it comes to considering risky behaviors and activities: all things being equal, the one with the least amount of risks would be chosen over something more risky. Heroin and alcohol addiction can lead to a variety of health issues, including addiction, physical dependence, and death. Therefor, it is not something that is generally chosen as a lifestyle or a form of pleasure."
790,"The U.S. President has a private Presidential railroad car that is kept in the sub-basement of Grand Central Station. Has Pres. Biden, the railroad guy, ever taken it out for a spin, or does he plan to do so someday?","The Ferdianand Magellan / aka Railcar Number 1 has been owned by and located at a museum in Miami since 1959.  

They did loan it to Reagan for a few days in 1984.  
If Biden wanted to borrow/rent it, I suppose he could.","

There is no indication that President Biden has taken out the Presidential railroad car for a spin, nor has he indicated any plans to do so. While President Biden enjoyed riding the rails during his Senate and Vice Presidential terms, the security requirements to do so have become increasingly complex, making it less likely that he will ever take out the Presidential railroad car."
791,Are forehead lines/expression lines reversible naturally?,They're just a normal thing to have lol. Chill,"

Forehead lines/expression lines are not permanently reversible without medical intervention. However, lifestyle modifications such as regularly moisturizing your skin and protecting it from the sun can help reduce the appearance of these lines over time.

795,Now this might sound like im paranoid but im not but anyways,"In the general settings on your phone, there should be a spot to disable location settings."," recently ive been getting some weird internet traffic coming from weird ips which can sometimes be User agent based attack bots, crawlers, or even a virus.

Most of the time, this type of traffic is nothing to worry about. However, if you are really concerned, there are several steps you can take to help protect yourself.

First, be sure that you are using strong passwords for all of your online accounts and try to use unique passwords for each site. This will help to make it more difficult for unwanted visitors to access your information.

Second, check to make sure your computer and any other internet connected devices are regularly updated with the latest security patches and virus definitions.

Third, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to help redirect your internet traffic and keep your online activity private.

Finally, if you notice that you are still getting a lot of odd traffic, you can contact your ISP to see if they offer any tools or tips to help block unwanted visitors."
796,"Feeling really bad & disgusted after a threesome, is that normal?","For the life of me I can't remember what movie/show this was, but the dialogue went like this
""I thought you were gay!""
""So did I! I had to suck dick to realise I didn't like sucking dick.""","

Yes, it is normal to feel bad and disgusted after a threesome. Having more than one sexual partner in a single encounter can be challenging due to the additional emotions and complexities involved. It is important to take your feelings seriously and to talk about your experiences with someone who understands. If your feelings are causing distress, it might be beneficial to reach out to a therapist or a counselor for help in processing how you're feeling."
797,Why do countries pay funding for vaccines when the company would make it anyway?,"It's a way of speeding things up, and it opens a level of transparency that wouldn't otherwise be there.

Fwiw, very little of the money has anything to do with research. It's more about putting the equipment and infrastructure in place to mass produce a new product.","

Countries pay for vaccines to ensure that all their citizens have access to safe and effective vaccines. Vaccine companies need assurance that the vaccines they are producing will be paid for and sold. This is especially true if the vaccine must be produced in large quantities in a short period of time in order to get it to market before a particular outbreak. Vaccines are expensive to produce and the cost of purchasing the product can be prohibitive for many countries. Government funding can also provide resources for researching and improving vaccines, something that may not be feasible without public assistance."

799,"Is the ""getting to know each other"" stage of social interaction profoundly uncomfortable for everyone?","""Is the ""getting to know each other"" stage of social interaction profoundly uncomfortable for everyone?""

No.","

No, the ""getting to know each other"" stage of social interaction doesn't have to be profoundly uncomfortable for everyone. Everyone experiences this stage differently and for some, it can be fun, exciting, and even a bit thrilling. However, for others it can be intimidating, awkward, and even uncomfortable. Ultimately, the level of comfort experienced in this stage of social interaction will depend on the individual person and the context of the situation."
800,Would what happened to Truman Burbank in the Truman show constitute some form of torture.,"I would think so. It’s super cruel, he is never going to be able to trust again. It’s a totally new kind of ptsd","

No, the events that occurred in the Truman show do not constitute as torture. Truman was not subjected to any physical or psychological harm during the course of the show, and the adventures he embarked on were entirely his own choices. Therefore, what happened to Truman Burbank in the Truman Show does not constitute torture."
801,is it ruder to come at the very end of a party or cancel altogether,"It’s not rude for responsibilities to keep you from an event. If you have the energy, it’s nice to show up. 


However, as per usual, context is key. The event can matter. Is this something you’ve said your go to with tons of time but didn’t bother to organise the time off work? That’s rude. This is just an example. 


We need to know more info to give you more confident advice on this.","

It depends on the situation. Generally speaking, it is likely more rude to cancel altogether, as it shows a lack of consideration for the people involved. Coming at the very end of the party could potentially be seen as rude, but it also may be understandable depending on the circumstances."
802,Is it possible for someone to see that you’ve unfollowed them?,Sure.  They could maintain a list each day and compare any changes to that list.,"

Yes, it is possible for someone to see that you’ve unfollowed them. Depending on the platform, they can receive a notification that you have unfollowed them. Additionally, if they look at your list of followers, they will see that you are no longer following them."
803,Is there a chemical reason why shampoo is translucent and conditioner is opaque? Or is this just a marketing standard?,My shampoo is not translucent. I think you need to look at a few more products and realign your observations.,"

The opacity of shampoo and conditioner is primarily due to differences in their ingredients. Shampoos contain surfactants, such as sulfates, which are typically colorless and translucent, while conditioners contain more oils, waxes or other lipids which are opaque. These ingredients allow for a variety of different textures, smells, and colors, which can be used to differentiate a shampoo from a conditioner. However, this is ultimately a marketing decision, as both shampoos and conditioners can vary in opacity."
804,Why did lady become a more general descriptor for a woman while lord is still only seen as a royal title?,"The word just...evolved. Over 400 years.

>The sense of ""woman of superior position in society"" is c. 1200; that of ""woman *whose manners and sensibilities* befit her for high rank in society"" is from 1861 (ladylike suggesting this sense is attested from 1580s, and ladily from c. 1400). ...Used commonly as an address to any woman since 1890s.","

It is largely due to the fact that historically, ladies were seen as a higher social class than commoners while lords were seen as an even higher social and political class. In British society, noble ladies were viewed with more respect and had a certain level of power and privilege that was not given to commoners. This contributed to the term “lady” becoming generally associated with all women, regardless of their social status. Meanwhile, the title of “lord” has remained largely exclusive to those in higher political and social standings, such as royalty."
805,Are condoms 100% reliable to prevent pregnancy if it never breaks?,"More like 98-99%. Over a year of regular use.

Which is something like 99.9% per single use, so pretty good.","

No, condoms are not 100% reliable at preventing pregnancy. Even if the condom never breaks, there is still a small risk of pregnancy from the passage of sperm through small openings in the condom. Condoms are the most effective form of contraception when used properly and consistently."
806,"Guys that pee on public toilet seats instead of lifting it up, why would you do that?","To keep you from sitting on it, as they should.","

Peeing on public toilet seats is an incredibly disrespectful and unsanitary action, and is never acceptable behavior. This inappropriate behavior is generally borne of a complete lack of consideration for other users of public facilities. In addition, it can spread germs and bacteria and may even lead to more serious health issues. Everyone deserves to use public restrooms without fear of encountering someone else’s bodily fluids."
807,What’s the story with this “Heil Spez” stuff?,"https://redd.it/16kibec

My reply when this was previously asked about 3 hrs ago.

This is a common question here","

Heil Spez is an online social media game that is most popular among youths in Germany. The game revolves around a virtual monopoly-style board game, where players compete to earn virtual currency by buying and selling properties. While originally used as an innocent way to pass the time, the phrase “Heil Spez” has since been co-opted by some people as a way to make Nazi salutes. As a result, “Heil Spez” is now associated with neo-Nazi sentiment and white nationalism."
808,Could movies like Fight Club or American History X be made today?,"No, because the writers and actors are on strike.","

810,Depo Birth Control shot,"It’s entirely normal for it to take awhile to start ovulating again after stopping birth control.

That can happen on any kind of hormonal birth control.

No birth control can make you completely infertile.

It’s normal to have light bleeding with the shot.

Please actually speak to a healthcare provider about your medical questions.","

The Depo-Provera injection (brand name Depo-Provera Contraceptive Injection) is a form of birth control taken every 3 months. It is a type of hormonal contraception that works by preventing ovulation and the release of eggs from the ovaries. It also thickens the cervical mucus, which makes it difficult for sperm to swim through and fertilize an egg. This method of birth control is more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy."
811,How do you find motivation to workout?,"Personally, I find it helps me to have a plan in place for what I’m going to do at the gym.

Otherwise I will just meander around and make shit up as I go along.","

816,Why does oldspice have the same shampoo and deodorant flavors when they don’t smell the same,Flavors? I think you're using it wrong,"?

OldSpice has the same shampoo and deodorant flavors because they are designed to complement each other.

The inherent difference in scent between the two products is intentional, as it gives the user the ability to customize how strong or subtle they want their scent to be."

827,What would happen if all human beings simultaneously went mute for one year?,The sounds of nature would take over.,"

If all human beings simultaneously went mute for one year, it would likely have an enormous impact on communication, economics, and social behavior. On the communication front, the lack of verbal communication would make it difficult to conduct business, communicate with family and friends, and share knowledge. Communication would have to rely on alternative methods such as sign language, written communication, and other nonverbal means. On the economics front, the lack of verbal communication would place a strain on global markets and cause disruption in supply chains, as well as in everyday purchasing and selling activity. Finally, the social effects of a year of silence could drastically alter our way of relating to one another, and could even lead to an increase in violence and chaos as members of the same society lack the means to understand and sympathize with one another."

These offerings are generally used to entice viewers to become customers of the companies which in turn benefits the company, the Youtube channel, and the viewers by providing access to services at discounted prices or with offers that normally would not be available. Sponsoring Youtube channels also allows companies to get their message out to a much larger audience and reach an audience that may not have been able to access their services otherwise. By sponsoring Youtube channels, companies are able to gain positive brand awareness and loyalty from viewers and increase their customer base."
833,"I've seen so many differing opinion on this one across Reddit, when is it appropriate to ask for someone's number?","Very subjective  & relative.

You gotta _""read the room""_ and _""feel the vibe""_. You ask when the time is right. It's a social art form. Flirting to the point that you can ask for a phone-number is not the same for any two people. No concrete rules.","

It is ultimately up to personal preference, so you should use your judgment and ask at the right time when you feel it is appropriate. Generally though, you should wait until you have had a conversation and established an emotional connection before asking for someone's number. A good indicator that it might be the right time to ask is if the other person is also expressing interest in continuing the conversation."

837,"Why is nudity a thing that (in average society) requires ""consent"" from someone else witnessing it?","There are other ways to express confidence of your body without exposing unwilling participants to your nude body.

Think it this way, a person is able to express their sexuality, but others are well withing their rights to not want to have sex with them. Saying you don't want to have sex with somebody is not shaming them, it's you simply not wanting to have sex with them.","

Societal norms dictate that nudity is generally viewed as a private act, and thus it is respectful to obtain consent from anyone who is likely to witness it. This includes close friends, family, and strangers. Nudity carries a certain degree of vulnerability, and it is considerate to ensure that everyone involved is comfortable with the situation and is giving their consent freely."
838,Why does schizophrenia not exist in other animals?,It might we wouldn’t know lol,"

Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that is unique to humans. It is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and brain chemistry factors that are specific to humans.

839,Why do males take so long to poo?,"Not my personal style to do it in the bathroom after work, but I think I might see where he's coming from.

Depends on his job, and plenty of other factors ... that just sounds like it might be his version of what I call ""everyone shut the hell up and leave me alone time.""

For me it was ""being caught in traffic"" when I really just relaxing under a tree in the park.","

There are a few reasons why men seem to take longer to go to the bathroom than women do. One explanation is that men's digestive systems tend to be slower than women's, so it takes longer for their food to be processed and for waste to move through their large intestines and that can lead to longer visits in the bathroom. Additionally, sitting down for a prolonged period of time may be more uncomfortable for men due to anatomical differences, so they may take longer breaks in between bowel movements than women. Finally, men may be more susceptible to any feelings of stress that may delay or inhibit normal defecation."
840,is what i’m doing enough?,"As a hetero-male, the best gifts I've received from women do not involve her spending money.

It's hard to answer this question because it depends on your goals and what you are aiming to achieve. Think about what you are trying to accomplish and review if your methods are helping you reach those goals. If not, then it's possible you may need to adjust your approach or do more."
841,"When you’re sick or you have a runny nose, how is there a seemingly never ending amount of snot?","Because the snot is mostly water. As long as you stay hydrated, your body can produce more mucous from water and a little bit of protein.","

This is due to an excess of mucus produced by the body. When the nose and throat become irritated, your body will try to remove the irritants by producing extra mucus. This excess mucus can cause the stuffy and runny noses that happen when you are sick."
842,Why do some people have allergy's to food while others don't?,"We don't really know. One theory is over-exposure. Another is what the mother is eating during pregnancy can help prevent allergies by exposing the body to the substance so the immune system doesn't over-react.

By the way you don't ""build"" an immunity to an allergen. Your body thinks an allergen is germs and over-reacts in a way that is harmful to you.","

Allergies are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is believed that genetic predisposition coupled with an environmental exposure can create an immune response to a normally harmless substance, causing an allergic reaction. Some people may be born with an inherent sensitivity to certain substances, while others may develop an allergy after being exposed to the allergen multiple times."
843,What Does Greening Out Feel Like?,"It was 20 years ago and the reason I really just avoid weed or any substance other than doctor prescribed…

A few friends and myself visited his girlfriend’s college.  It was an unfamiliar setting with unfamiliar people. It felt like I was falling off the side of Earth.  If I didn’t grab grass I felt like I would fall horizontal to the ground.

When inside it felt like when I’d walk or turn that I wasn’t walking or turning but the world it self was moving in relation to me and I was stationary.

Before I felt to sleep I was convinced Dave Matthew’s had put “angel dust” in it in spite of everyone else smoking it and having zero issues.  This claim was shouted by myself repeatedly to the residence of some dorm and at a later point I found myself screaming it in the quad like some Dragonborn from Skyrim.

I cried for my mom.  My girlfriend said I was embarrassing and broke up with me.  The Denys grand slam I had the next morning gave me diarrhea for days. My ass burnt the entire two hours back to my college. 

Fuck you SUNY Oneonta.","

Greening out is a colloquial term that refers to when a person experiences adverse effects from taking too many psychoactive drugs or medications. These effects can range from overwhelming feelings of nausea and dizziness to passing out and potentially vomiting. Other symptoms might include confusion, impaired motor skills, loss of balance, and breathing difficulty. In most cases, it is recommended that people seek medical attention if they experience any of these symptoms."
844,"Solo hiking/backpacking, is it really a good idea to lie/pretend that you're hiking with others when you meet people on a trail?","It's certainly something you can do as a precaution, but I've never felt the need.

I've always felt far safer in the middle of the woods than the streets of a dirty city, anyway.","

No. Faking companionship while hiking puts you at serious risk of safety and is not a good idea. Much of the loneliness of solo hiking or backpacking can be mitigated by connecting with people you meet in a safe, honest way. Doing something like this can lead to new friendships, unique perspective, and advice from those who know the trail best.  It's important to remember to always be aware of your own safety and stay alert for potential dangers."

847,Why do some people like thier own stink,Just to double-check that it really is your own odor and to know just how strong it is. Then you think about why it's that strong and what you need to do to ensure that it doesn't happen again at an embarrassing time.,"?

Some people may think that their own body odor is pleasant and even familiar, so it may be comforting to them. Other people may be unaware that they smell bad to other people, which can happen if someone has been accustomed to a particular smell for a long period of time."
848,Wth Walmart,"They deliberately have boycotted contactless card payments to promote the usage of mobile wallets instead.  It's a nearly nationwide decision, and it also affects their Sam's club chain as well","

850,What is the one thing you would change about yourself and why?,I would get rid of my tendency to overthink. It always works against me.,"

If I could change one thing about myself, I would be more outgoing and confident. I tend to be quite shy and introverted, which can sometimes make it difficult for me to make friends and feel comfortable in certain social situations. Becoming more outgoing and confident would make me more comfortable with myself and others."
851,Do I need to tip the driver too?,"Normally it's better to just tip the driver directly, since if you tip through the website, part of that goes to the restaurant.","

It is customary to tip your driver, especially if they have provided great service. However, it is not required."
852,"Why are school curriculums generally more advanced in developing countries, especially for STEM subjects?","""Why are school curriculums generally more advanced in developing countries, especially for STEM subjects?""

standardization.","

In many developing countries, educational policies emphasize technological and scientific learning in order to create an educated workforce. This can be especially pronounced in the STEM subjects, where a higher level of scientific knowledge is seen as necessary to remain competitive in the global marketplace. School curriculums are also often designed to emphasize these topics in order to best prepare students for their future careers. Additionally, the support for science, math, and technology-related subjects is often higher in developing countries due to higher levels of public and government investment. This investment usually comes in the form of subsidies for higher education, increased access to technology, and improved teacher training. All of these factors combine to make school curriculums in developing countries more advanced in STEM subjects."
853,Do hostage negotiators greet the hostage taker,The goal is to establish rapport so im sure they do.,"?

Yes, hostage negotiators usually greet the hostage taker and introduce themselves. This allows the negotiator to establish a relationship with the taker and build rapport—which is crucial in successful negotiation."
854,I need help articulating why this is bad?,"Well, in all cases they are making unfounded assumptions in some way or another. 

For example, your socialist claims:

* premise A: humans are naturally social animals
* premise B: natural is good
* premise C: it defies nature for social animals to pursue individual aspirations
* Conclusion: A human is good if they prioritize communal service over individual aspirations. 

The premises, if true, fairly well lead to the socialist's conclusion. And premise A is probably true, I think most would agree. However, premises B and C are not really a given. They are very bold assumptions made by your socialist. In order for the conclusion to be cogent, the premises must first be proven to be true. 

At a certain point in their arguments, each of your examples makes an unfounded assumption as part of their logic. Question one of those assumptions and the argument breaks down. 

Um, who is your audience for articulating this? If they are one of these groups then good luck changing anyone's mind with logic.","

The specific situation is not known, so it is difficult to provide accurate advice in this situation. However, in general, an action can be considered bad if it violates laws or rules, harms or inconveniences others, wastes resources, or creates a negative impact on the environment."
855,Is there still nutritional value in those pieces of corn leftover in your poop?,Hmm I wonder what bro is thinking of doing after he shat corn 🤔,"

No, there is no nutritional value in the pieces of corn that are leftover in your poop. The digestive process destroys most of the nutritional value of the food we eat."

Yes, it is recommended to wash your pillows every 3-6 months to keep them free from dust mites, mold, and bacteria."
858,How do sharks and other sea animals end up beached?,"Confusion, exhaustion and distress, if they've travelled for a long time without much food they can get disorientated and end up in a really bad way, thinking they could rest but get pulled in by the tides and their bodies give in to what is happening to them.","

Many factors can contribute to sea animals becoming beached. Some examples include storms, sickness, changes in water temperature or salinity, and even human-related activities such as fishing and shipping. Sharks may get stranded by swimming too far into shallow waters, and can become trapped in a tide pool when the tide goes out. In some cases, sharks become disoriented and lose their ability to sense which direction is away from shore, leaving them stranded near coastal areas."
859,I'm having a hard time getting mail from my apartment complex and I'm wondering the legality of it.,"It's not withholding mail to only have certain hours. It's withholding if they never give it to you or make the hours way overly-restrictive, which it doesn't sound like they are.","

It is likely against the law for your complex to deny you access to your mail. In some cases, complex owners are required by law to provide access to mail boxes in the building or on the property. Contact your local post office and discuss your situation to see if there are any laws that could be used to ensure you receive your mail."
860,Are there any pets that you can have as a child and still have when you are an elderly senior?,Tortoises and parrots,"

Yes – there are many types of pets that can stay with you throughout your life.

862,Is it weird to cuddle with your friends?,Only on Reddit is it considered normal to cuddle with a friend of the opposite gender (assuming both heterosexual). Most people will consider that to be weird. Cuddling is a romantic activity and not a platonic one. It's usually done between couples.,"

It depends on the relationship you have with your friends. Generally speaking, cuddling is thought of as an intimate and romantic activity, and is not something usually done between friends."
863,I live with the roomate from hell. What should I do?,Hire someone to clean and make him pay for the majority of the bill.,"

First of all, it's important to try and approach the situation calmly and remain as rational as possible. If possible, communicate openly and respectfully with your roomie to try and resolve any issues. If communication is not possible or does not help, consider reaching out to a neutral third party (such as a residence hall advisor) who can help mediate the situation. If the situation is unsafe or too confrontational, consider looking into other housing options or speaking to a mental health professional for additional help."
864,“They want to have their cake and eat it too” how does this make sense?,"It means that after you eat the cake, you do not have it any more.","

865,Why is cancer said to go in “remission”?,"Remission just means ""hasn't grown for x amount of time""","

Cancer is said to go into remission when the symptoms of the illness have decreased and the cancer is no longer detectable. This does not necessarily mean that the cancer is cured, as it could still come back. It is possible for the cancer to be in remission for an indefinite period, or even permanently. In some cases, the remission may be partial, and some symptoms may still persist."
866,A question about craneflys (daddy long legs),They’re crane flys and they’re completely harmless.,"

Are craneflys venomous?

No, craneflys (also known as daddy long legs) are not venomous. Although they have two venom glands, these glands are not connected to their mouthparts and so are not capable of delivering any venom."
867,Roommate refuses to pay me back," *Should I foricibly take the mattress back from his room?*

yes!!","

It can be difficult when someone refuses to pay you back. If you have not already done so, you should consider a verbal reminder or written request for repayment. If the request is still not fulfilled, you may need to escalate the situation by consulting with a lawyer or taking them to small claims court. Keep in mind that this can be costly and time consuming. Sometimes it is best to make a compromise or let go of the money in order to preserve your relationship."
868,How likely is it that the “island of stability” exists,"I assume you mean on the periodic table? It could quite well exist. That doesn't mean that elements there would exist for more than a second though. They would just be relatively stable, compared to their neighbors.","?

It is difficult to say with certainty. Currently, physicists are still exploring and making predictions about the possible existence of the “island of stability.” Because the elements necessary to form this region are expected to be within a region that is smaller than the nucleus of a single atom and many of the elements involved are as yet undiscovered, it will take many more years of research and experimentation to definitively answer this question."
869,Is it wrong to use online discussion boards as a means to understand real life situations?,"When you use it as *just one* of several different tools, it's a useful tool.

The problem is some people use it as a one stop shop. They'll base major life decisions on something one random asshole says.","

No, it is not wrong to use online discussion boards as a means to understand real life situations. Online discussion boards can provide a platform for people to discuss real life issues and to gain perspective from other people's experiences and opinions. However, it is important to remember that discussion boards are not always moderated and therefore users must be critical and cautious when engaging in conversations."
870,"My girlfriend kinda looks crosseyed when we're looking into each others eyes up close and personal. But her eyes are perfectly straight in any other situation (if shes looking at me from a farther position, etc.) , is this normal for human eyes?","The closer a person’s gaze gets to the tip of her own nose, the more her eyes are going to cross. That’s how we’re able to focus. Your eyes are going to do it, too, if your faces are super close together.","

Yes, it is normal for human eyes to focus differently at different distances. Some people may experience cross-eyed vision when looking at something very close up, but it should not be visible from a farther distance. If you are concerned about her vision, it is best to talk to a doctor."
871,I can’t think of original music (please help),"What I would do in your situation is to start out by copying parts of some of those songs, and then modifying them very many times. Keep modifying until it actually is something that you've created.","

You may find it helpful to research different composers, or listen to different musical genres to find inspiration. You can also try something simple, like playing around with musical scales, to come up with a melody. You can also come up with lyrics first and then work on the melody. You could also try improvisation – try playing around with different instruments and just going with whatever sounds interesting. Finally, you can look up tutorials online for more specific ideas. Good luck!"
872,Why do girls hate or don't like men who are super nice?,"Your friend is an idiot. Being nice is not the problem here. If girls are losing interest texting, it's either bad luck, or you're doing something else. Assuming this is talking to random people on dating apps, it's just kind of the way it goes and has pretty much nothing to do with you.","

There is no single answer to this question, as every person's experience can be different. Some girls may find men who are overly nice or overly accommodating to be off-putting, while others may find it attractive. It is important to remember that each individual has different preferences and opinions."
873,Why cant I hear my girlfriend on the phone?,She might be petty and getting revenge?,"

It is possible that the trouble could lie with her phone or her service provider. If you have tried multiple phones and both of you still cannot hear each other, then the issue could be related to her phone network or service provider. It could also be caused by a problem with the connection between your networks or a third-party service, such as a firewall. In this case, you should contact her service provider for support."
874,Does feminism struggle with racism?,Absolutely. See: Taylor Swift dating racist Matty Healy.,"

Yes, feminism does struggle with racism. In its attempt to overcome gender-based inequalities, feminism has historically struggled to address racism and discrimination faced by black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). While some contemporary feminists have taken up the struggle against all forms of discrimination, some have either chosen to ignore the intersections of racism and sexism or have been outrightly hostile towards BIPOC within the movement. It is only through active and intersectional inclusion of all forms of race, gender, class and other forms of discrimination that feminism can truly become an effective and intersectional movement."
875,"Why do drugs and ""crime"" seemingly fall into my lap?","> I also tend to go with the flow of life

IOW, it's the company you keep.  This is why felons on probation are typically forbidden from associating with other felons.

Start going with your own flow rather than meekly following the current.","

It is possible that you are in a high-risk situation and may be surrounded by people who engage in criminal and drug-related activities. This type of activity tends to “fall into” peoples laps when they either have weak boundaries or trust everyone who crosses their path. It is also possible that you are being taken advantage of due to being young and naive, which is unfortunately common in the world today. It is important that you take steps to ensure you are not in such a vulnerable position and to keep yourself safe."
876,Can Amazon Customer Service help me choose between chairs?,They cannot,"

877,Do people unoronically listen to straight up prehistoric sounds,I think some people enjoy and appreciate the primal and raw textures of prehistoric sounds.,"?

In some cases, yes. For example, certain recordings of whale songs have become popular among some music fans, and some musicians have deliberately incorporated sounds from long ago into modern compositions."
878,"How do electric vehicles charge, especially outside of cities?",You plug them in,"

Electric vehicles can be charged outside of cities in a variety of ways. Charging stations for electric vehicles are increasingly common and can be found in most major cities, but they can also be found in many small towns as well. There are also many types of portable chargers that can be used to charge electric vehicles while traveling. Many hotels and vacation rentals offer charging stations for electric vehicles, or there are electrical outlets that can be used with an adapter to charge electric vehicles. Finally, many gas stations now offer charging points for electric vehicles, usually located near the gas pumps."
879,Why do people use onlyfans?,"There's always a market for specific, higher quality, ethical content even if you can get stuff for free.","

People use OnlyFans to make money by creating subscription-based content for their followers.

Additionally, it can be used by many small businesses as a platform for selling products or services."
880,Does wearing a suit to an interview when it's 100+ degrees out side look funny?,Looks idiotic to me,"

Wearing a suit to an interview during hot weather is not unusual, and most interviewers will likely appreciate the effort.

881,"Why do companies hire models from other countries, fly them there etc? Isn’t it cheaper to find one from their own country, beautiful people are everywhere?",they want a specific model,"

Hiring models from other countries offers companies more diversity, allowing them to tap into new markets they may not already be targeting. It also gives them access to a larger pool of talent and a wider range of looks. Additionally, businesses may find that models from other countries may have better experience or portfolios than others in their own. Flying models from abroad can be expensive, but the cost is oftentimes outweighed by the potential rewards."
882,Why is Turkey named after a bird?,"It's not. Turkiye is named after the Turkish people.

The bird was named after the country, since they resemble a bird from Turkiye.","

Turkey is not named after a bird, but rather the country is named after the ancient kingdom of Turkey, which was named after the Turkic tribes. These tribes, originating from Central Asia, were known as the 'Turuk' and their empire was known as the 'Turk Empire.' The name was eventually adopted into English and corrupted to ‘Turkey’."
883,Which loved famous person who died young would’ve been disliked if they stayed alive and got older?,James Dean was a bit of a twat.,"

It is impossible to say which famous person would have been disliked if they had stayed alive and got older. People's opinions can change over time, so it is impossible to predict how someone would be viewed as they got older."
884,Could The Earths Core Expand (Go SuperNova-Like),"Hi /u/CraftyDelay862,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*","

No, the Earth's core cannot expand in a supernova-like manner. The Earth's core is composed of solid and liquid iron, and is held together by the strength of gravity. In contrast, a supernova is an astronomical event that occurs due to the rapid and explosive release of energy when a star reaches the end of its life cycle. The Earth's core does not have the same kind of energy or fusion reactions occurring in a star and thus is incapable of releasing such an explosive amount of energy."
885,How does permabanning work,Permaban is short for permanent ban. You will not be allowed back on.,"?

Permabanning works by banning a user permanently from a website, game, or forum. This usually occurs when a user violates the rules of the website or game multiple times, usually when other warnings have been given. When a user is permabanned, they are prohibited from accessing the website or game at all, and their account may be removed. In some cases, a user’s IP address may be blocked to prevent them from accessing the website or game."
886,At what time does it become rude to have a bath at night?,"Just take a bath, dude","

It is generally considered rude to take a bath late at night if other people in the same home are still awake or trying to sleep. Usually, 11 p.m. is the latest time recommended for taking a bath."
887,Is there any truth to the traits connected to astrological and horoscope signs?,"No, it's all nonsense.","

No, there is no scientific evidence that astrological and horoscope signs have any bearing on a person's character or behaviour. Astrology is not a proven science and many experts regard it as a form of superstition."
888,How do you use a bidet?,"Do you have a real bidet or a Japanese toilet that sprays your intimate parts? If you have a real bidet, you wipe as you normally do, then you dismount your wc and you ride your bidet facing the faucet (even if someone will tell you the contrary), check water temperature, mix some soap (for intimate parts, check the ph) with some water and then wash yourself with your hand. If you’re a lady wash from vag to anus, not the other way, you don’t want to risk having bad bacteria in your 😺. Rinse and dry with a towel, a tiny one that you will replace as needed, when too wet or you feel it is dirty.","

To use a bidet, first adjust the water temperature and pressure as desired. Then use the bidet like a common toilet. Sit down on the bidet and make sure you are facing the attached nozzle. The bidet will spray the water over your bottom, so position yourself accordingly. You can use your hands to adjust the aim and pressure of the water. When you’re finished, use the separate faucets to rinse off the bidet and dry your bottom with a towel or toilet paper."
889,What happens when only a part of your body is exposed to space vacuum?,"I’m no scientist, but based on space being a vacuum I have a feeling if part of your body’s exposed the rest will be coming out within .000000000008 seconds.","

If only part of your body is exposed to the vacuum of space, you would experience severe and potentially fatal hypothermia, decompression sickness (the 'bends'), and a rapid drop in air pressure around you which can cause rapid disorientation, confusion, and possibly unconsciousness. Some of the effected tissues could potentially be irreversibly damaged or destroyed. In extreme cases, loss of the exposed body part would result."
890,Can someone explain how the TV licence in the UK is even legal?,It’s legal because parliament passed a law requiring payment of the license fee to watch live television broadcasts.,"

The TV Licence in the UK is enabled by the Communications Act 2003. This law enables the Secretary of State to impose a licensing system for television receivers. The money from the licence funds the BBC, which has a royal charter that requires it to be funded by a licence fee. Without a TV licence, a person cannot watch or record live television programmes on any channel or device. This includes the use of streaming services such as BBC iPlayer. Breaching the law by not having a TV licence or using equipment to watch live programmes without a licence could result in a fine of up to £1,000 plus court costs and a criminal record."
891,Has anyone used dry shampoo as deodorant? How did it go?,It won't work as deodorant.  They are two different things.,"

No, dry shampoo should not be used as deodorant. While some types of dry shampoo could help to absorb genital odors and sweat, it is likely not effective enough to completely eliminate odors and sweating. Additionally, it could cause irritation in some people, so it would be best to use an actual deodorant instead."
892,Any particular better time to apply to a job?,When you have a job. That way you have income coming in while you look for something better,"

The best time to apply to a job is as soon as possible; if you see an opportunity that interests you, don't hesitate to apply. You shouldn't wait until the last minute to apply, because you may miss out on any deadlines. Additionally, employers will sometimes fill open positions quickly, so it's important to apply as soon as you can to make sure you don't miss out."
893,Is our Star dead in the eyes of Aliens?,"No, it would be the opposite. They would see our Sun how it looked billions of years ago as a “baby”.

Or looking at it another way, aliens in the far future would see our Sun as it is now even though it will be gone by then.","

The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors, such as the level of technology of the alien species, what region of space they occupy, and how long they have been around. Therefore, it is impossible to answer definitively whether our star is dead in the eyes of aliens."
894,Eating organic food?,"Nope, it's also worth noting that both organic and non-organic produce have pesticides, organic produce is only not allowed to use synthetic pesticides.","

Yes, eating organic food is a healthy choice. Organic food is grown without the use of chemicals such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals increase a person's exposure to potentially harmful chemicals which can have long-term health consequences. Organic food is also produced without the use of hormones or genetically modified organisms, both of which are not allowed in organic farming. Finally, organic produce often contains higher levels of vitamins and essential minerals than non-organic food."
895,Anyone else working in fast food overly paranoid of suspicious people?,"Not me, maybe because I am a man!","

It's understandable to be cautious and aware of your surroundings when working in the food industry. However, it's also important to keep a professional demeanor and to trust people until they give you reason not to. If you find yourself becoming overly paranoid, it's helpful to take breaks when you can to clear your mind and focus on the task at hand."
896,Is their a way to give certain subreddits priority in my home feed? i have some subreddits id prefer to show up more than just the random meme subs.,"A number of things: 

-Join subreddits you most prefer to content from
-Disable recommendations under your settings (generally, it’s a good idea to play with these anyway)
-Create custom feeds, to which you only add subreddits you want to look at in that custom feed","

Unfortunately, there is no way to give priority to certain subreddits in your home feed. Reddit's algorithm automatically determines which posts appear in your Feed based on a variety of parameters such as karma, upvotes, the age of the post, the engagement it has received, etc. However, the best way to make sure you are seeing content from particular subreddits is to subscribe to them and add them to your “my subreddits” list. That way, when you go to the home page, any new posts from those subreddits you are subscribed to will appear in your feed."

898,What are the easiest countries I can immigrate to as a US citizen without a degree,"Hi /u/Cautious-Purchase987,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

People would have no way of learning from their mistakes or building on their knowledge and experiences. Without the benefit of being able to remember the past, it would be impossible to develop meaningful friendships and alliances. Every day would be a fresh start in which people would need to relearn how to get by, while constantly needing to adjust to new situations and experiences. This would make the world a much more chaotic and unpredictable place."
