0,"With Friday 6/30 likely being the Court's final day of the term, I figured we'd open a megathread to discuss all decisions of the October 2022 term ranging from the FELA case from earlier this week to affirmative action today to the expected student loan decision tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Rules are relaxed.","I’m still baffled by many of the court’s decisions. Most recently I can’t seem to logically reconcile the following: 1. We learned that businesses are allowed to discriminate, picking and choosing their customers as they wish (under the guise of freedom of religion/speech). And then 2. Universities cannot use race as a factor for admission. Well… it seems to me that at least Harvard, being a private college and thus a corporation (sorry UNC), is allowed to discriminate per number 1 above.. so they can use race, or nepotism, or net worth, or anything they want as admission standards, right? Putting aside my own beliefs and trying to put myself into the minds of conservatives, this just doesn’t seem consistent. Am I looking at it wrong or missing something?"
1,"I don't care what team they're on, I'm just curious if this is a topic any of the candidates have been talking about. I feel like a candidate with a good plan to fix housing affordability could win a lot of votes. ","Since Biden has been addressed, I decided to check the top 5 Republican candidates-

Trump- No mention on the issues page on his website. In his first term, his budget proposals cut spending on affordable housing programs, so not a great reputation. His current discussion of it pretty much only concerns ‘fixing the economy’ first and then I guess housing will sort itself out or he hasn’t come up with anything past that.

DeSantis- No mention on his website. Did pass a $711 million plan aimed at making housing more affordable that included some positive provisions for affordable-housing projects. Not sure if it has actually translated to better outcomes quite yet.

Vivek- No mention on website and no mention that I can find elsewhere. Not surprising given he is running as the Trump substitute/VP pick.

Haley- No mention on website or elsewhere that I can find.

Pence- No mention on website. When asked about solving housing, he took the same stance as Trump in that fixing the economy- more jobs, lower interest rates, etc.- is the first step in getting there. No current plan on what comes after that though.

Based on none of them referencing housing affordability or availability on their websites, it sounds like it isn’t much of a priority at all for any of these candidates"
2,"I've been wanting to ask this for a long time, but a news publication made me finally do it. Sorry if it's obvious, but I don't know the answer.

Russia and North Korea are negotiating guns and ammo, which could substantially help Russia in the Ukraine War. 

Why make it public though? If Russia just did it in silence and maybe next month just surprised the whole world with a succession of well-succeeded offensives in the Ukraine War, that should be a smarter move, right?

Is there any sort of global agreement to make such meetings public to the world? I know it's not all of the meetings and negotiations, but I can't help but think how (in my fantasy world at least) that's not a good strategy.","Countries often do keep key meetings secrets, so the premise of the question is simply incorrect.  As to why any particular meeting was not kept secret, that's a bit more complicated, and I don't know in that case.

If negotiations are done in person, it's much harder to keep secret, as the location of key diplomatic personnel and especially heads of state tend to be either public or at least well known (ie heads of state often have so much security and apparatus with them that it's hard to keep it secret if they're in another country).

NK really doesn't have the kind of supplies or industrial capacity that would make much of a difference to the Ukraine war.  So most likely publicization is to raise morale or talk up an ally."
3,"In my home country Finland there's parties such as, The Coalition party, Social Democrats, The Center, Basic Finns, The Leftside, Pirate party, Liberal party, Christian democrats and then some 1-man spinoffs that gather 1 seat in the parliament every term or so.

It's like there is a clear distinction. Is there a historical reason why (in my eyes) everybody in US belongs to a democratic republic but has to vote either the Democrats or the Republicans?","The Democratic and Republican political parties are some of the oldest on earth still in operation. (Last time I looked into this, it actually appeared that the Democrats are the oldest political party on earth, beating out the UK's conservative party by just a smidge.) 

As a result of this, their names don't really follow modern political party naming trends of including your ideology in the name. They pre-date the tradition.

The Democratic Party is, simply, named in honor of democracy. The party had a few different names thrown around when it was being founded, but the Democratic Party pretty quickly won out and was finalized as the name.

The Republicans are named after the Democratic-Republican Party. This was the dominant political party in the US from roughly ish 1800 to the 1820s. They competed against the Federalist Party... until they completely and utterly destroyed the Federalist around the back half of the 1810s. The Democratic-Republicans are named that by historians to differentiate them from our modern parties, but when that party actually existed they referred to themselves as the Republicans.

So when our current day Republicans were getting started, they took the name of the old party that used to dominate the country."
4,"The US gets a lot of flak for its high healthcare costs in comparison to the rest of the world. Yet, America spends [more money per capita than any other country in the world on healthcare](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/health_spending_per_capita/). In 2020, the US government spent over $11,000 on healthcare for each person on average. And yet, the US has the lowest life expectancy by far in the OECD. For Japan, the nation with the highest life expectancy in the world, the healthcare expenditure figure is just over $4,000. Why do we have such a low life expectancy for the amount we spend on healthcare?","1. Exorbitant healthcare costs, caused by technological and pharmaceutical patents, that make the best treatments only available to the rich.

2. A shortage of nurses, rural doctors and medical specialists, driven by medical associations and the high cost/long duration of medical school.

3. A lack of access to affordable healthy foods (food deserts).

4. Inactivity.

5. Stress."
5,"I've always been curious why so many countries use the English reference name? Espana, Deutschland, Nippon to name a few. When Turkiye changed it's UN name in 2021, it made me think about it more often. 

Doesn't it seem strange that so many countries use the label that was improperly put upon them hundreds of years ago?","So the UN has 6 official languages. English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese.

A nation's formal name is translated at the UN into all 6 of those languages. 

So. For example, Germany is officially Germany in the English language, Allemagne in French, Германия in Russian, Alemania in Spanish, and 会员国 in Chinese. (The UN's website isn't translated to Arabic. But Germany has an Arabic translation too.) 

All versions of this name are equally correct. None of the languages have formal priority over the other. So it's actually not correct to say that the UN uses Germany. At least, not exclusively.

As to why Germany is called Germany and not Deutschland? Because German is not a UN language. And in English, which is a UN language, the nation is known as Germany. That is the correct translation. And these translations can be decided by the country in question. Germany could request to the UN that its English translation be Deutschland. In fact, it could request that all 6 of the UN languages translate to Deutschland. But the German government has chosen not to do this as of now.

So. Basically. Germany is called Germany in the English translation of its name because the Germans are cool with that. Meanwhile, calling the country by its 5 other translated names is also entirely correct."
6,"Google tells me that a president can only pardon federal crimes & governors have the power to pardon state crimes, but I'm also reading some previous presidential pardons that seem to fall on the state crime level, so now I'm super confused.  Thanks in advance.","Presidents only have the power to pardon federal crimes. Governors generally have the power to pardon state crimes. Trump is facing two federal indictments, and likely two state indictments.

Let's take the federal indictments first. If Trump is convicted of these crimes, a future Republican president can pardon him. In fact, it is extremely likely, if not inevitable a Trump pardon will happen the next time a Republican controls the White House. Ironically, a pardon would be iron clad if it came from a Republican president other than Trump. It's still an unresolved question whether a president can pardon himself. So if Trump is re-elected, he can try to pardon himself, but it may not stick. The sure fire bet is for another Republican to pardon him. That would be impossible to challenge.

Trump is also facing an indictment in New York state. Winning the presidency would not help Trump resolve this matter, because pardon power rests with the Governor of New York, currently a Democrat. It's conceivable a Republican could win the governorship in 2026 (they came within 5 points in 22, I think). But unlikely. So a New York conviction is the most likely to stick. However, the jailtime would be minimal - possibly even non-existent. The whole thing could get bumped down to a misdemeanor.

Lastly, Trump is likely to be indicted under Georgia state law. The Governor of Georgia does not have pardon power. Rather, the power is vested in a panel appointed by the governor. This provides some degree of insulation. But Georgia is a red state, and I imagine eventually enough pressure will result in a pardon there.

So there's your tally. A New York conviction will likely stick, but it won't be for much jail time. Federal convictions will last as long as there is a Democrat in the White House. And a Georgia conviction will probably be pardoned."
7,"As a POC who loves European culture, I feel bad when people view assimilation in a negative light. I genuinely have a passion for European culture, and my home-culture Is bland and bleak.

Is there anything wrong with willing assimilation?",I think people have a negative perception of assimilation because historically it refers to forced assimilation; I don’t think there’s anything wrong with voluntary or willful assimilation.
8,"How does this work? Just like corporations and  lobbyists wrote bills, can a nonprofit do that?

Lmk if there’s a better sub to post this in! Thanks in advance.","Yes, but I think by the way you wrote this you may be confused about what ""writing legislation"" entails.  They can't submit any legislation they wrote to congress to try and get it voted on.  The context in which they write legislation is through members of congress, who either solicit help from someone they feel knows the industry or it will happen from the other direction, a lobbying firm will want something achieved and then convince a congressperson that they have written a bill and the congressperson would gain something by sponsoring it.

Anyone can write a bill, the tricky part is convincing a congressperson to actually sponsor it.  Unless you have a lot of power and influence, they don't exactly take random unsolicited submissions for what should be obvious reasons.  A nonprofit would maybe have more success, especially if the issue they care about and the bill they write aligns with the issues that the congress member in question supports.  But there are a lot of barriers even then, since most congresspeople don't want their professional reputation tied to something someone else wrote (At least a ""someone else"" that isn't on their staff or doing it as directed by them)."
9,"Just got through the newest trump indictment. Damn wild. I noticed a lot of quotes from various conversations that took place (between trump, pence, co-conspirators, counsels, etc). How were these obtained? Do all parties testify thoroughly prior?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;","So obviously some of them were public, so things like Trump tweets, DoJ statements, and things in public are lifted from the publicly available sources.

Some quotes are from written media that Jack Smith obtained through his investigation. Things like text messages, emails, meeting notes, and other written communication are quoted word for word from the text source.

Some quotes are videos and recorded calls (like the Trump-Kemp call about Georgia). These are obviously direct quotes as well.

Some quotes come from witness interviews (which is what I think you're referring to). For example, page 11 has quotes related to a conversation between ""Co-Conspirator 2"" and ""Arizona House Speaker"". The Arizona House Speaker was interviewed by the FBI prior to this indictement, so the quotes related to this event are likely quoted from his interview, which is his best recollection of what was said.

Jack Smith and his team have a lot of interviews as well (that they did themselves and that they've obtained from others like the January 6th committee interviews), so a lot of the quotes and paraphrases come from those interviews."
10,"Got it from this clip here: [https://twitter.com/i/status/1686199526670151681](https://twitter.com/i/status/1686199526670151681)

If you campaign in New Hampshire, any votes that you get in Georgia wont count either. His name won't appear in Georgia either. 

This just seems insanely corrupt, how is this allowed what is the legal basis? ","They set the rules for their primary to ensure that there was more socioeconomic and racial diversity in the early primary period; the NHDP had and has ample opportunity to ensure that their delegates get counted. The NHDP is actively campaigning against doing so. 

These rule changes were voted on by DNC membership and overwhelmingly approved.

Nothing corrupt about it. Political parties are free to set their own rules and guidelines because they’re private institutions."
11,"For example, the opposite phenomenon is found in Latin America, where socialist leaders like Daniel Ortega, Pedro Castillo and Evo Morales gained a lot of support from rural folk.

In Australia, [our rural folk is split between the right-wing National Party and the centre-left Australian Labor Party](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Australia_General_Election%2C_2022_--_Results_by_Division.svg) (which to be fair, in the past supported reactionary policies like the Stolen Generations and the White Australia Policy). Meanwhile, in Europe, ""agrarian"" parties tend to be centrist, or focused solely on farmers' issues.

But in the USA, [rural areas vote overwhelmingly for the right-wing Republican Party](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/2020_US_House_Election_Results.svg). While one can say this is due to a history of rural conservatism, there are some counterpoints to that:

* Rural Americans don't just consist of the disgruntled descendants of Confederates, they also include substantial Hispanic and African American demographics, plus there are rural areas in Union states too.
* Like the USA, Australia also has a history of indigenous people and genocide against them - so why aren't Australian rural folk overwhelmingly right-wing?
* Rural poverty is a major issue in the USA - so why doesn't it drive rural Americans to the left (or even to socialism/communism) like it does in Latin America?","There's a book that covers the subject, [What's the Matter with Kansas?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F_\(book\))

12,"My question is, if the USA has an immigration policy, why is that so many migrants are being admitted and transported from state to state in the USA?  What is the legal justification for this in the context of our immigration laws?","The bottle neck in our immigration policy is the court system.  Immigration courts are not Article 3 courts, they are Article 2 courts.  Funded and run solely by the Executive branch and not subject to Federal court or Supreme court review except in extreme cases.

Per our immigration policy anyone who presents at the border with a valid asylum claim is given a court date to make their case.  The backlog of these cases topped 1 million under President Trump in  2019 and is on track to double that number today.  

Average time for a case to clear is 4 to 5 years and many go over a decade.  Most asylum seekers are released pending their court date.  Some have either family or friends in the States they can go live with, others rely on local support networks and working under-the-table to get by while waiting to see if they will be deported or not.  The Federal Government generally does not ship them around from state to state after the initial intake process is complete.

Border states like Texas, which have been dealing with immigration issues for years and feel the rest of the Nation doesn't take them seriously because of the big hats, have recently decided it is a funny gag to talk a bunch of people with nowhere to go into a plane or a bus and drop them off on someone else's doorstep.  But that doesn't really have anything to do with our immigration laws."

14,In the UK the Liberals became much smaller as universal male suffrage allowed Labour to get a huge urban base. Because Canada's parliamentary system is modelled off of Britain's why didn't a similarly union-supported Labour Party become the primary opposition to the Conservatives? Universal male suffrage was also passed around the same era too.,"Do you mean supplement or supplant?

Duverger's Law says we should expect only two major parties in a system like in the UK or Canada. A party on the outside, therefore, has two discrete paths it can take: it can seek to replace one of the big two by moving closer to the centre, and broadening its coalition, or it can maintain a more extreme position and apply pressure on the major party closest to it. Conversely, the major parties also have two paths: to co-opt ideas that become popular and championed by the ideological flanks, or risk being replaced by said champion.

In the UK, the Liberals were basically supplanted by the Conservatives, who adopted many liberal positions. In Canada, the forerunner of the NDP put pressure on the Liberals to move left and build a welfare state—and they did. Canada's Liberals are not ideological liberals, they are always oriented around the political centre, whereas the Liberals in the UK during the Great War and afterward were not quite so flexible or effective."

The Dutch government just collapsed due to the country being flooded with too many Muslim immigrants.  Is the Netherlands going to reform under an Islamic government?  Will it still be a democracy?  What about its NATO and the EU membership?  What about the royal family?

Are the police at their posts?  If there's no government, who's paying them?  If there's no police, shouldn't there be a lot of violence, looting, etc.?  (The Dutch are a pretty chill low-crime society but it seems a lot to ask for millions of people not to commit opportunistic crimes during anarchy.  Plus, there are enormous numbers of immigrants from less chill, less low-crime places.)

Shouldn't the neighbors or the EU or the UN or somebody be sending in troops or peacekeepers or something to restore order?  Shouldn't this be higher in the news?","The Dutch government is a coalition of parties.

18,"In the recent SCOTUS case [303 Creative LLC v. Elenis (21-476)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf) the court ruled 6-3 that the web designer in the case has the right to refuse to work on a wedding website for a same-sex couple on the basis that it violates for religious beliefs as a Christian.

Here's my question...

Would this ruling allow this web designer to ***also*** refuse to work on the wedding website for a couple that is a **different religion** than her?","It actually really has nothing to do with religion, it's that the government has no ability to compel speech from people against their beliefs.

A French immigrant graphic designer cannot be forced to design a poster glorifying England, a Jewish interior designer can't be forced to make a nazi-themed house, and an atheist pro-life printshop owner can't be forced to make pro-abortion pamphlets.

20,"It may sound loaded but this is a genuine question because I legitimately don't know if it's this easy. The ""housing crisis problem"" as in the rising cost, and ""easy"" as in being simple to fix not easy to implement. The solution is to just build more homes (private or public) and remove regulations that prevents homes from being built such as some of the restrictions in zoning laws.   


My understanding is that most developed countries don't do this because people in real estate holds an immense amount power and they will lose a lot of money.  Based on my train of thought homes crisises happens when they all want more money individually at the same time. If I'm right which I don't think I am, then they're spellcasters making this reality feel like it's just nature. What am I missing?  ","This is like asking why so many Americans are unhealthy or homeless. There isn’t one answer so there isn’t one solution. Like we chose 70 years ago, to standardize on the car for our transportation. This dramatically reduced how many homes and how many people can live on a given acre of land. So the potential for new home is less. But that didn’t directly cause the slowdown in home building around 2010. That was was because of the banking crisis. Which was the result of deregulation years before. 

We also have policies that make construction harder and density harder. Including current owners who like the value of their property to go up. We also decided as a society to make home ownership the basis of both most personal wealth and the engine of the economy itself. So everyone’s looking at it. There’s also so much extra money at the top with nothing better to do, that companies are buying up property just to feed their own growth.

Japan has the most successfully unregulated real estate market in the world. But ask Americans if they want to live in places shaped liked Tokyo. The answer will be no. So ultimately we’ll need to reduce demand. Birth rates are falling but will take a least a generation to play out."
21,"My dad (who is very conservative) complains that democrats make these huge bills (1000s of pages long) and only give congress a few days to read through it in an attempt to push their agenda and sneak things into the law. 

I am very liberal but I so I don’t agree with his politics. Is he right though? Are these bills impossible to fully be read and comprehended in such a short amount of time?","Technically true, but not really in practice.

First off, yes. Bills often are 1000s of pages.

But the big but here is that a lot of a modern bill is taken up by legalize. For example, much of those 1000 pages are citations and references to how the bill fits into the literal legal code. Aka: line x of z now reads...

It's important info for structure and courts, it's not important info for determining what the bill does. The actual effects of any given bill are dramatically smaller in length - if you wrote them out in normal English. 

And then the other big but here is that members of congress have staff. So it's not the literal congress critter needing to sit down and read 1000 pages. They can task 5 people to take 200 pages each. (Or something like that.) And present summaries. For understandable reasons, lots of people get upset by the use of staff, and believe members should indeed actually read all 1000 pages by themselves. But I'll just point out the senior leadership of every other even slightly large organization on earth doesn't operate that way. I can guarantee you that Roger Mosby - who is the ceo of the boy scouts - isn't sitting down at night to read the full report on the tents that troop 795 set up that weekend."
22,"I am very confused and new to this. Missouri decided to make the decision to move to caucuses rather than primaries. My questions is how does one participate in a caucus? I understand it may be different by state, but how does it usually work at least. Essentially, how would an average citizen be able to get themselves into participating in a caucus?     ","Great question, and way to be proactive about getting involved!

Here’s how it goes: You show up wherever your local community is caucusing (usually a high school gym, library, church, or something similar but sometimes individual households, too).

If you have a candidate in mind to support, you walk toward their designated area of the gymnasium. If you don’t have someone in mind, you can go up to the other groups and ask why you should support their preferred candidate.

At an appointed time, the caucus leader will call for a vote, and each group presents how many people are supporting their preferred candidate.

Usually, after the first round, the *least* preferred candidate is eliminated, and their supporters will reallocate themselves to their second-preferred candidates (there’s usually a viability threshold percentage that candidates have to meet to continue on to the next round).

In the midst of all of this, people are trying to persuade you to join their group; this can take the form of actual candidate talking points, or in some cases literal bribery (eg “Hey, Steve, I’ll buy you a drink after the caucus if you join us.”)

They can get heated as people get more dug in to their respective positions. Usually there is alcohol involved for of age people (BYOB). 

When the caucus is adjourned, delegates are appointed based on percentage of caucus goers votes. Those numbers are reported, by precinct, to the state party who then tabulates and announces delegate count to the media."
23,"I was listening to a talk about authoritarian personality and the speaker did bring this topic up, and how studies have borne out that it is, in fact, a thing. What I'm trying to wrap my head around is what that would actually look like. From my very (left-leaning) biased, American perspective, how can you be ""authoritarian"" about freedom? 

The term alone brings up images of right-wingers thinking that, say, a trans person asking to be called by their chosen name and appropriate pronouns is some kind of controlling, authoritarian demand. Or that the left demands lockstep conformity and obedience, as evidenced by how much they'll cancel you for saying that something demonstrated by science doesn't exist, or generally treating some group or another as subhuman. Basically calling the left ""authoritarian"" because they don't approve of calling people slurs 

On a more reasonable level, I could see stuff like socialist revolutions, violent protests, or just hyper-PC SJW types (the kind of split hairs over minor nonsense that benefits no one) as actual examples. Could a rigidly environmentally-conscious society be a left-wing dystopia, for example? Strict controls on what you can and can't do or have, but rooted in presumed ""safety"" rather than morality? Or maybe the WEF's infamous ""you will have nothing and be happy"", as left-wing authoritarian?

The studies I skimmed as I'm not smart enough to read them, suggest that LWA applies when a person scores high on authoritarian traits for left-aligned positions only. So, what, supporting legislation to mitigate climate change makes you authoritarian? If so, now what? 

Sorry for the ramble. I feel like when we talk about RWA, many people have an image or two in their mind of the type of person, their beliefs and behavior, and how it's problematic. I'm trying to understand how that genuinely works from the left wing side.","Some of that does come from trouble defining ""left wing"" and ""right wing"" as these terms are very much based in local cultures and don't mean consistent things all the time. 

""Right wing"" is starting to have a populist connotation attached to it, at least in the English speaking world for example. That has really not been the case for much of democratic history. But I digress. 

Left wing authoritarianism is usually used to refer to the USSR or China as obvious culprits, but there are dozens of other examples. Post colonial Africa is full of anti-colonial crusaders preaching equality only to become more brutal dictators than the colonial powers were. And often times they will evoke the idea of colonial powers as some justification for why their regime needs to be so brutal, trying to rebuild or reunify a country the white man tore apart, or something along those lines. 

Or take Syria's Assad regime. It's called the Arab Socialist party. People in Syria pay no taxes, housing is heavily subsidized, so is gas, and honestly before the war, most needs were tended to by the government. What many might see as left wing. But simultaneously, dissent was not tolerated, secret police ensured politics were not really an acceptable topic of conversation outside of praise of the government, and generally, the opinions of the people only mattered insofar as preventing rebellion. 

But if you're looking for examples closer to home, those are a little more difficult to find, but more importantly they run into local biases. What you see as legitimate government use of force is to someone else, an authoritarian crackdown. Canada has made what I would say are some concerning steps recently, but what others would say is totally justified. Holland also seems to be ignoring big segments of its population in order to pursue climate goals, a more left-wing objective. Are those authoritarian countries? Hardly. But nothing is ever really that binary in the real world."
24,"You occasional hear these issues flair up occasionally but why isn't there a consistent push and advocacy from the government to make these places as states, especially if the citizens of such want to be states?","They’re both quite different scenarios. 

At large, they’re both tricky because they have their own internal dynamics on whether or not they should or want to be states and their perception in the US. 

On perception, there’s often a perception that both would be Democratic safe states if granted statehood - granting additional electoral college votes and Congressional representation to Democrats. While DC likely would be based on current voting trends there - Puerto Rico is less clear. They use technically a different system of parties but in fact, the majority of statewide posts are with those who affiliate more with the Republican alliance than the Democrats. Either way, I think pro-statehood people would argue this shouldn’t be a political game - if they’re citizens have to be states, they deserve to be represented equally (and many would make the argument that they are more deserving of, for example, their respective senators than smaller current states ((that are predominantly Republican)). 

There’s a long-standing understanding that DC was intentionally created as it is to explicitly not be a state. This was, of course, before it was a thriving metropolis with a large number of long-term residents itself. That’s why, even in proposals to grant DC statehood, there is still a carve out (of various sizes) on what counts as the federal district still. Some have also proposed that it be subsumed outside of these carve outs into existing states (notably, part of the original territory made for DC has already be reabsorbed into Virginia). All to say, there’s no clear path forward on which way DC is granted statehood if it’s granted statehood at all. But notably, DC residents have expressed pretty strong support towards statehood. 

Puerto Rico is less clear. There have been several referenda - each with their own flaws. There’s a general perception in the US, especially given the dynamic above about ‘upsetting the balance’ that unless Puerto Rico chooses statehood - it’s not for the US to force it. Again, this has gone to vote in different ways in Puerto Rico and almost all of them have had some issues - confusing questions, multi-step questions that don’t grant a strong majority or even plurality, boycotts on the vote, etc etc etc etc."
25,"Before Putin invaded Ukraine, Poland and Hungary were seen as brother nations united by social conservatism and soft euroskepticism. Then the Ukraine war revealed a deep divide between the two, in which Poland became incredibly pro-Ukraine and pro-West, while Hungary became more anti-West and cynical. What is the cause of this gap? Why does Hungary’s social conservatism supercede their support for Ukraine while Poland’s anti-Russia stance takes priority?","Since no one else is here, I'll give my  take:

Poland and Hungary used to have a common interest in protecting their national sovereignty against EU norms. However (this will be important later), Hungary broke way more norms, and more fundamental to democracy, such as removing the judiciary's independence and controling national media. Meanwhile, Poland broke fewer, less fundamental norms, such as wanting Polish courts to overrule EU ones and discriminating against queer people.

This is because Poland's opposition to EU norms came from traditionalist catholicism, whereas Hungary's came from illiberal authoritarianism. 

Poland, since it became independent from the USSR, has always strongly opposed Russia (as the geopolitical heir to the USSR, responsible for oppressing Poland for decades), and the Catholic Church played a leading role in resisting the USSR, so that traditionalist catholics doubtlessly support the current democratic system against the previous one (embodied by Russia).

Hungary, under Orbán, has gradually drifted away from the liberal-democratic norms of the West, moving towards certain illiberal, authoritarian tendencies. Over time, that has led to a growing tension between Hungary and the EU, accompanied by a relatively friendly relationship towards Putin and Russia (through brotherly illiberal authoritarianism, albeit a more radical one).

Thus, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine focused the political lens on Russia vs western democracies, Poland didn't hesitate to become a leader in backing Ukraine at all levels (taking more refugees, supplying more money and arms, etc...), whereas Hungary spread Russian propaganda and disinformation against Ukraine and blocked/ignored joint EU/NATO action in support of Ukraine (sanctions, providing aid, arms, etc...).

And that is how Russia has caused the fundamental differences between those two perspectives to come to the forefront, eclipsing the circumstancial overlap is resisting some (distinct) EU norms. They are now less likely to cooperate against the EU, due to strong Polish opposition to anything Russia-friendly (aka Orbán's Hungary). Russia has united the West in opposition to it, but Hungary increasingly seems to no longer be a part of that West."

It's been true for decades that Turkey doesn't get along so well with portions of the European section of the alliance, the recent actions are just a manifestation of that rather than a change.  It's still the case that all of them have a common strategic interest of defense against Russia which is the core of the basis for the alliance, and that concern tends to be far more important in geopolitics.

In Turkey's case it also seems that the objection is mostly done for local Turkish politics; one of the inherent difficulties of a large organization where everyone has veto power is that it gets very unwieldy and difficult.

Hungary doesn't matter all that much for NATO anyways, unlike Turkey, it doesn't control much of strategic importance.  Nor is Hungary's military all that relevant."
29,"Given what RFK jr has said in public I think he has an immense depth of knowledge and has a unique and authentic model of the world. He is not Republican or Democrat, just authentic. However, there are claims that he has made ""anti-vax"" claims, and I am curious to know exactly what those claims are. Right now I think these ""claims"" are more likely to be warped and skewed, and I cannot find any quotes from RFK jr that support them.

30,"I'm not on either side and just generalizing here based on my observation. There are people on the left don't like Biden but will always vote against Trump and there are people on the right that don't like Biden so they vote Trump. So why is both side sticking with two polarizing candidates when choosing anyone that is slightly more moderate should result in an easy victory? For example, if Republican just choose a candidate that Democrats won't vehemently vote against, then they should swing enough votes to win the presidency. Same goes for the Democrats side because they are people on the right that is tired of Trump but really dislike Biden and will most likely not vote for Trump if someone else is the candidate. There is also the 3rd party voters too that will probably pick a new less polarizing candidate if there is one. Isn't the whole point and goal is for the party to win the presidency? Why aren't they choosing this strategy?","Because the sides are far enough part that ANY candidate is polarizing.  Biden isn't someone that would historically be considered 'polarizing',  he's only polarizing because the Republicans make a point of demonizing their opponents.  Biden is quite moderate already, selecting a moderate doesn't really help.  Another factor is that elections are often less about swing voters choosing which side to vote for than about whether the voters on your side show up at all.  If you pick a more centrist candidate, then some of the voters on your farther fringe, while they wouldn't vote for the opposing candidate, they may choose to simply not vote at all; and the net effect of that is stronger.

Another factor is the nature of the primary system means that winning the primary is also a significant factor; many primary voters do not vote based on long-term strategic considerations, but based on which candidate they prefer themselves.

As to why the Republicans stick with Trump?  Some sort of shared delusional madness.  Also, anyone who turns against Trump gets shunned by the rest of the party and loses their career.

On the Dem side, there's a significant incumbency advantage, and people don't want to give up the incumbency advantage by picking someone else.  Also there's no clear top or favored alternative, so if it were to be left open it'd be a messy and questionable fight which would take a lot of resources.  By avoiding that fight they can save all their campaign resources for the general election."

32,"I've started to get their videos in my recommendations, which I understand somewhat due to watching more than just my usual debate bro youtube content for coverage.  Something I always assumed was Forbes being generally more ""center-right"", with most of their platform being right only when it comes to economic policy.  Lately, they've really pushed culture war ""gotcha"" moments (especially GOP politician clips on trans debates), and comparatuvely they use charged language in many of their video titles.  Based on the comments in each video, they seem to pander to the right broadly as of late.  Did they get new management?  Have they been bringing on more extremists, or is their YT branch more radical compared to their writing staff on Forbes proper?  Or have I been blind to this because I've only recently seen these clips just now?

33,I run a bar and was recently having a conversation with an ultra-conservative customer. He was saying that if the US elects a conservative President this could allow for a peaceful change of power in Russia because Putin would be allowed asylum in the US. Putin is currently wanted by the ICC. I know the US pulled out of the Rome Statute and has put a lot of rules in place to prevent US service members from being tried internationally. Would these rules protect a foreign national on US soil from extradition?,"As far as I know he could still be extradited to the Hague.  I'm pretty sure US asylum laws don't provide any special protection against war crimes extradition requests; and those other things are only about protecting US citizens, not about asylees or others.  It'd be mostly up to whoever's president at the time I'd think, and could change as the presidency changes.  At any rate that customer has no idea what they're talking about as Putin would never be allowed asylum in the US, nor would he accept if it were offered."
34,While Turkey is siding with Russia openly and clearly not a democratic country?,"There is no provision to remove a country from NATO, unless you count everyone else quitting NATO and forming a new alliance. Even if there was, Turkey plays spoiler a lot but also has a pretty important strategic role. They are one of the most militarily credible members of the alliance, they control entrance and exit to the Black Sea, and they serve as a buffer between most of the alliance and the Middle East.

You say they openly sided with Russia, but they have been supplying lots of weapons to Ukraine (e.g. TB-2 drones) and have blocked Russia from reinforcing the Black Sea Fleet. It also is useful to have *someone* who can talk to Russia, and Turkey has mediated various agreements between Russia and Ukraine (like an agreement to allow grain exports via the Black Sea)."
35,"Now that the Wagner Group has declared rebellion: 

&#x200B;

* What is the Wagner Group's objective?

- Remove/replace the Minister of Defence and Chief of the General Staff

- Prevent Wagner PMC from being subsumed by the Ministry of Defence, as all private military personnel were ordered by the Kremlin to be put under contract with the defence ministry as ordinary soldiers

Neither objective was met, [and his actions were condemned by previous allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/prigozhin-insurrection-russia-ukraine-war-destined-to-fail-weaken-putin/) like the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Sergey Surovikin, the general who commands Russia's air forces.

36,"In the U.S., members of the Congress are always busy. There's always something to address whether its legislation, committee work, constituent services, town halls, district visits, etc. I image it's similar for members of Parliament in Westminster systems.

So if an MP is appointed to a government portfolio or becomes Prime Minister, how do they do it all? Like, do the people in Papineau experience a different type of representation with Justin Trudeau as their MP than if they elected a backbencher? My assumption is that most of the MP duties are delegated to staff and then the actual MP just makes a few ceremonial local visits to keep up appearances.

American politicians don't really ""stack"" jobs like parliamentary countries do and I've always been curious about it.","To some degree, American politicians do 'stack' jobs, just maybe not exactly the same way. 

But to the core of the question, usually they get extra staff that help manage it. Similarly, while they don't become the Head of Government with it, US members of Congress actually do have leadership responsibilities that often gives them much larger responsibilities (including on committees as you've flagged) and in party leadership roles. And to serve those, they get additional staff and often effectively additional offices worth of staff. 

So for example, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House has more staff than, for example, a junior Congressman with no significant leadership positions. And that staff is there to support his role both as Speaker of the House, and as Representative for CA-20. 

Some would similarly argue that that kind of role distracts from a lot of their district based priorities - and in particular constituent services. Realistically - that's probably true to some extent but it's also true that the MP or the Congressman's role in most constituent services is managed by staff anyway. What is true is that their focus has to increasingly become national as their portfolio and public position demands. 

That being said, the reverse is also true in that most constituents actually see value in having their representative be in a position of additional power - and some could argue then that their priorities take an even higher priority rather than lower."
37,how exactly did liberals ruin his life?,"That might be a touch maudlin but he got taken to task pretty hard over a couple of scandals he had in his career. I say ""maudlin"" because I'm having trouble thinking of something that really prevented him from attaining some of the highest highs this country has to offer.

The biggest thing was probably the Anita Hill saga. There's been oceans of ink spilled on what happened and regardless of where you come down on it that's probably the closest that Thomas ever really came to being blocked from advancing. If there's any point at which his future career may have seemed to be threatened, the Anita Hill hearings were probably it.

There's a lot of noise that got made later about his wife's activism and his proximity to her and his leveraging his position to help her do her work. That may have caused a rift in his personal life that was unpleasant.

There's also been *a lot* of light shed fairly recently on Thomas' personal habits which range from the moderately eccentric (having an apartment with no furniture but a massive pile of porn) to the offensively gross (openly discussing said pornography with coworkers and subordinates regardless if they wanted to or not.) That probably wasn't a lot of fun.

As for blaming it on liberals, that scans for someone with his political perspective. There's a racial dimension to the criticisms of Thomas in that a lot of liberals (especially white liberals) expected someone like Thomas to be more liberal because he's black and that kind of criticism from white liberals, I can imagine, landed like nails on a chalk board. The term ""Uncle Tom"" has been applied to Thomas quite a bit from liberal circles and not always by people who have an informed view as to what that term means.

Again, I would say that ""ruined his life"" is a bit dramatic. He was a Supreme Court justice, was very wealthy, and enjoyed access to the halls of power for quite some time in a position that's almost impossible to get removed from. I think it's fair to say that a lot of the heat Thomas got was politically motivated but he still had a pretty long track record of objectively reprehensible behavior.

Sure, someone pointing out that you sexually harassing interns is a problem because they don't like you politically is maybe not the most honest actor but that doesn't mean that you're not doing something that's wrong."
38,"Hi guys, I’m not sure if it’s the right sub to ask this question, but at least it looks like one. I’ve never really understood what US gets out of the huge military it has. I’ve seen a lot of people talking about its power projection and I understand that it’s able to influence other countries decisions because of the military superiority, but what is the exact benefit the average US citizen gets from this huge spending? Wouldn’t it be better if the government left a small defense force and spend all the money left on infrastructure and welfare, or are there some economic benefits of power projection that outweigh the costs?","I'm not sure there actually is a benefit, I've heard people argue that there is one but I've never found their arguments to be convincing, mostly their arguments centered around securing trade or the status as the world's most common reserve currency or something, most of which would've happened anyways imo simply due to the size of the US economy.

Part of the reason the US spends so much on the military is political; there's strong bipartisan support for military spending, and politically the average american voter tends to support military spending, and be upset about cuts in it, even though americans are under no actual threat from anything.  The very notion of fear is still enough to make them scared and favor spending.  Also the military is in ways a welfare program, with the industries for it carefully spread out all over the country, so that cutting spending means major job losses in some communities.

Some of it is also a legacy from times during the Cold War, when there was some, at least arguable, value to being able to protect areas from getting invaded."
39,"First you have the Vice president obviously then the house speaker and then the senate pro tempore that makes sense but after that it’s Secretary of State then treasury?

Both state and treasury aren’t elected they are just appointed?

Shouldn’t only elected positions be in the line of succession?

Shouldn’t after senate pro tempore it be senate majority leader then minority leader and then majority minority whips etc. 

Tho unlikely it’s entirely possible that the Secretary of Transportation becomes the president but not say the Senate Majority leader who represents a state and has presumably been elected a number of times?","First: in practice, it’s closer to what you want than you’d think. If the line of succession falls to Cabinet secretaries, they can be bumped by a Speaker of the House or a President pro tem of the Senate as soon as there’s someone eligible in either of those roles (3 U.S. Code § 19(d)(2)). If the Speaker and pro tem are killed and the Secretary of State becomes acting President, then as soon as there’s a new Speaker or a new pro tem, they become acting President instead. The Cabinet secretary just serves as a placeholder before one house of Congress picks a new leader. (At least in theory. The line of succession has never gone below VP, and the kind of chaos that would result in the Secretary of State taking over is also the kind of chaos where written rules might not be rigorously followed.)

Second: There’s a problem with putting elected officials in the line of succession. If the death of an official would mean they get replaced by someone with wildly different views, that can encourage assassinations. Even leaving aside assassinations, the President is elected for a 4-year term on a particular platform, and their death shouldn’t necessarily result in the opposite platform being implemented. There’ an argument that the Speaker and pro tem should *not* be in the line of succession for exactly this reason. Cabinet officials are basically aligned with the President’s goals, so if the office falls to them you wouldn’t expect as wild a shift in policy.

This becomes particularly obvious if you start to put minority party congressional leadership in the line of succession. In 2021, both houses of Congress and the Presidency were held by Democrats. Given that, it’d be weird to have Republicans in the line of succession. They weren’t elected nationally (McCarthy’s congressional district electing him doesn’t give him any sort of national mandate). The political party that chose them as its leaders did not have a majority. You could make a decent case that the Secretary of State back then had more of a democratic mandate than the House Minority Leader."
40,"Doesn't that effectively set up a system where people posing as one party can run on that platform only to switch parties and hand those votes to the opposition? How is that Democracy? It just feels wrong, and I'm not even sure if it's happened the other way around where an elected Republican became a Democrat, but it'd still be wrong in my mind. ","It isn't that she switched parties.   It is that she is voting close to opposite of how she told constituents she would vote.  

For example. If she was mostly a Democrat in the way she voted, except for being pro life, if she went Republican because she couldn't deal with being in a party that accepted abortion, I get that.  But she ran as a typical Democrat, won because she said this is how she would represent people, then said, I lied, ha ha, and voted like a typical Republican, That isn't acceptable. 

Should Democrats run people in red areas, have them tell Republicans what they want to hear, get elected then vote blue?   Of course not."
41,"When I first read about what quorum meant, it seemed relatively straightforward. But the more I learned, the less I understood.

For the sake of argument, let's say you have a city council with 5 members. We'll name them A, B, C, D and E. 

If A, B and C meet at a bridge to discuss possible repair work (with no public hearing posted), that's an obvious quorum (against the rules).

What if A and B meet at the bridge on Friday to discuss the bridge. Then B and C meet there on Saturday to discuss it. Even though the same information was passed between all 3, is that not a quorum?

Since the concept of a quorum predates digital communication, does that create some gray areas? For example, if 3 redditors are discussing a local event on a post in r/Akron and unknowingly all 3 are part of the same board, would that be a violation?","Depends on how the rules are set up, but generally a quorum is ***at least*** a simple majority of representatives being present."
42,"This is overly simplified but here's my logic. In a democracy the people are given the power to elect representatives to influence laws/decisions that push their specific interest.

Therefore, it becomes the politicians job to appeal to as many of these different groups as possible, even if that means spending money we don't have. It seems like the only way a politician can win is to overpromise, which is probably why there's the common phrase: ""All politicians are liars"".

We can demonize politicians all we want, but it seems like we are in a flawed system. Like who would ever vote for a politician that will take away benefits over another politician that would double our benefits?

**Question 1:** Is increasing the debt ceiling sustainable?

**Question 2:** Are we in a flawed system?

**Question 3:** In reference to the raising of the most recent debt ceiling, it seems like the democrats are the ones that want to spend more money.

Namely, the bill changes the ""work requirements"" from people aged 18-49 to 18-54, requiring a larger population to show they work to receive food stamps. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this will actually INCREASE federal expenditure (as the debt limit bill also exempts veterans, homeless, and young foster care adults from these work requirements), but the GOP claims this is incorrectly calculated.

But why? If the President has any executive power, couldn't he impact what gets paid for?

Couldn't the President, as the chief executive, direct his employees to selectively shut down industry in Republican-run states in order to shift the game theory calculations and encourage Republicans to start funding the government? For example, if the government runs out of money, why couldn't the President selectively shut down, just in red states, things like the BLM, BOEM, BSEE, EPA, OSHA etc, and then direct federal law enforcement to close all related industry in those states since the government isn't able to fund safety or regulatory oversight? While keeping those agencies working in blue states?

If you shut down those agencies, you're furloughing the 'federal law enforcement' you're expecting to close all related industry. It's not like the Marines step up to enforce occupational law when all the OSHA guys aren't in the office.

There is some wiggle room in terms what you designate as 'essential' or 'non-essential' government functions but it's not particularly relevant. Your average citizen barely notices a government shutdown is occurring. Even the industrialists you're imagining might be harmed don't notice it much because it mainly manifests in an interruption of oversight rather than an interruption in operations.

The people who *do* notice are the 'non-essential' government workers who aren't collecting their paychecks. They notice immediately - and they're overwhelmingly Democrats."
47,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is the committee within the CDC that formulates the CDC vaccine schedule:

>The ACIP is a globally respected voice in vaccination policy and profoundly influences the design, scope, and funding of U.S. vaccination efforts. ([A Half-Century of Prevention](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1410049))

According to the CDC website, 
 
> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sets the U.S. childhood immunization schedule based on recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Before recommending a vaccine the ACIP considers many factors, including the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. ([The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Childhood Immunization Schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/conversations/acip-recommendations.html))
  
And yet, the ACIP spends less than $1,000,000 a year on research, including support staff:

> Estimated annual cost for operating the Committee, including compensation and travel expenses for members, but excluding staff support, is $514,560.  Estimate of annual person-years of staff support required is 2.5, at an estimated annual cost of $405,427. ([ACIP Charter](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/committee/charter.html))

I would expect the ACIP to have an operating cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year, since vaccination is of very much interest to the CDC, and the CDC has a yearly budget of $11 billion. (The CDC currently spends ~0.08% of its annual budget on ACIP operations.)

What am I missing here?","The ACIP is an advisory committee. These sorts of committees are set up to give federal agencies access to expertise outside the government, but advisory committees don’t actually *run* anything and membership is closer to “occasional volunteer work” than “job.” Actually running a federal research enterprise is a full-time job that involves lots of bureaucracy and administrative work, and that’s not what the doctors on ACIP volunteered to do. Their job is just to read the research and make recommendations. If they think more research is needed they can ask for it, but that research would be managed by other parts of CDC (or by NIH, other federal agencies, universities, and/or private companies). 

Because research is managed by full-time federal employees (either running labs or issuing grants) and not by ACIP, ACIP’s own expenses are very low. Voting members are optionally paid a token amount ($250 per day spent attending a meeting, which works out to like $1500 a year), and non-voting members are unpaid. The only significant expenses are travel costs for the three annual two-day in-person meetings and the costs for a handful of federal employees to support the committee itself (stuff like organizing the meetings, distributing information, running mailing lists, dealing with travel expenses, etc.)"

Right now both Russia and the West choose to not engage in a direct fight with their militaries, so that's how it is.  This also has a long history of happening; during the Cold War there were a lot of similar 'proxy wars' between Russia and the US.

There's plenty of lesser options other than a direct hot war between two powers, and if both sides are willing to use that lesser option then so be it.  It's not like any other nations get to choose whether Russia is 'at war' with the West; it only matters whteher the two parties consider themselves at war.

From an international perspective, iirc I'd say that supporting one side isn't an automatic declaration of war, it IS a casus belli though - a cause for war; if someone is supporting your opponent then you're justified in declaring war on them.  Whether or not you choose to do so is still your choice though."
49,"This question is inspired by the [VisualPolitik EN](https://www.youtube.com/@VisualPolitikEN) video [How South Korea Is Running Out of Children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etq5gOc4F0M).

The video shows the following phenomena:

* South Korea has a fertility rate of less than 1 child per woman
* South Korean conservatives refuse to have kids outside of marriage, while South Korean progressives refuse to have marriage or children
* The huge costs of a futile government program to encourage births
* Local municipalities subsidising men who want mail-order brides

At this point, could North Korea's strategy be to just wait for South Korea to collapse from the costs of its aging population? Would the USA or its allies be willing to defend a South Korean state that has already collapsed? After all, we did pull out of the failed state of Afghanistan after 20 years.","No, because North Korea is not really capable of swooping in any case.  The USA won't let it and barring some **radical** major changes in Chinese policy, neither would China."
50,"Within this budget battle MSM has commented on invoking the 14th Amendment. I understand the debt clause in it but how exactly would that legally work? For some reasonI picture Biden standing up saying “I declare the 14th!” Like Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy.

I under MSM is just using inflammatory language to get viewers and more clicks.","Essentially Biden would sign an executive order instructing the Treasury Department not to stop paying America's debts, citing the 14th Amendment as the legal justification. He would probably have to do this before the debt ceiling is actually reached, which pretty much means right now. I think the language the White House has used on it amounts to considering it as an option for next time. Someone would then sue the government, and it would go to court, eventually reaching the Supreme Court, which would rule on whether or not the Debt Ceiling violates the 14th Amendment"
51,"Sort of like some of the independent cities in Virginia.

The districts would still be contiguous, but some would be surrounded by another congressional district on all sides.","Theoretically there is nothing stopping it.  Assuming this report is correct, at least one [state legislative district](https://redistricting.lls.edu/redistricting-101/where-are-the-lines-drawn/#contiguity) was created so there were a couple floating chunks which were surrounded entirely by other districts as part of one district.

Congress could require contiguity or whatever the technical term is to prevent one district being encompassed by another, but I don't believe there is a textual restriction on creating some sort of a doughnut district?"
52,"Hi.

I hope you are having a great new year so far.

The Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2071-2077, authorizes the Supreme Court to prescribe general rules of practice and procedure and rules of evidence for the federal courts. However, if such a law were constitutional and the authority to prescribe such rules not intrinsic in the judicial power, the Congress could modify the statute to say ""Whenever the Congress is a party to a case, the rules of any court shall be modified to preclude the opposing party from presenting any evidence of any kind"", putting it's thumb on the scale, or to say ""Whenever an act of Congress is at issue, no rule shall permit any individual to have standing to challenge the same"", resulting in Congress being able to place its actions beyond judicial review and rendering the Constitution a dead letter essentially.

However, if the REA were unconstitutional and the authority to establish such rules intrinsic in the judicial power, just like the power of judicial review is, this issue could not arise.

So, I am at a loss as to how the REA could possibly be constitutional.

Thanks in advance.","The US Constitution grants *vastly* more power to Congress than either the President or the Judiciary. It's easy to forget (or never even realize) just how much authority Congress has because its members usually can't muster the majorities and supermajorities required to actually wield much of its power.

The Constitution was also not really written to be robust against lawyers exploiting technicalities and logical oversights to let the nation's representatives abuse their powers. It's probably an impossible requirement to have of a constitution anyway, since every system of laws must ultimately be enforced by people.

In any case, yeah, the Constitution permits Congress to determine how the federal courts operate, and even what cases they're allowed to hear. You might say that's bad or even nonsensical, but that's the current law."
53,"Yeah, I know West Virginia is a big coal-producing state, but cars don't run on coal. What is Manchin's specific complaint about electric vehicles?","This is going to largely depend on the specific bill you are referring to.

But big picture, Manchin is a ""blue dog Democrat"". These are Democrats who actively seek the Center-Right of the Democratic Party, often defying the party line as going too far. This name/group was founded in the 1990's as a response to Democrats losing seats in 1994. Manchin is not an ""official"" member but has been given the title based on his politics. Manchin represents West Virginia, where Trump won by ~40% over Biden. The only reason Manchin wins is his incumbency, and the fact he routinely disagrees with the Democratic Party on many leftist issues. This is just to frame where Manchin's mindset is. Manchin must routinely align himself with the Republicans and conservatives to ensure he can win re-election. Make no mistake, the minute Manchin leaves office, a Republican is winning that seat.

On to specifics, Manchin opposed electric vehicles recently because these vehicles and their parts are manufactured overseas, particularly China. Manchin is very hesitant over spending (remember Manchin and Sinema alone torpedoed the ""Build Back Better"" plan in 2021 solely based on costs), so he opposes unnecessary tax credits and opposes the fact these tax credits support manufacturing in other countries over America.

https://rollcall.com/2023/03/31/new-electric-vehicle-credit-rules-set-over-manchins-objections/

>""American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas,"" Manchin said. ""It is a pathetic excuse to spend more tax payer dollars as quickly as possible and further cedes control to the Chinese Communist Party in the process.""

Manchin only agreed to the tax credit because it would stimulate domestic manufacturing, and is now critical the Administration is loosening the rules and letting manufacturing going overseas.

West Virginia also has very few EVs, so his constituents aren't clamoring for more EVs."

Geopolitically it's the hot topic which unites Russia and China, and it will be sweet music to Putin's ears. Dedollarization may be one aspect of it but there are others too. I struggle to believe Xi was referring to anything specific, and certainly not to Hong Kong/Taiwan/anything like that."
56,"I was looking for differences between the State and the Government, and most of the results come with these two statements, but aren't they contradictory?

The first statement sounds like that the State still exists even when the current government collapses when a civil war breaks out between multiple factions, or in a foreign invasion when the government is decapitated.

The second statement sounds like that once the government collapses, the State automatically disappears.

Am I misunderstanding anything? Thanks.","Former Poly Sci major here.

In Political Science, ""Government"" refers to the actual people in charge. It's similar to how we use the word ""administration"" in the United States. The Government is the President or Prime Minister and their cabinet, or the King and their advisors, etc. The ""government changes"" when a different group of people comes into power. So in the United States, every 4-8 years.

The State is hard to define, but in this context, it refers to what the ""government"" (the people in charge) are in charge of.

A Government collapses when the people in charge lose their authority (this can't really happen in an American-style presidential system. The terminology comes from a parliamentary system where the Prime Minister and Cabinet can be removed at any time). A State collapses when the State cannot do the things that the Government oversees (collect taxes, enforce laws, defend borders, etc.).The second quote simply means that as long as the State exists, someone is in charge. In a well-functioning state, there is never a power vacuum. If a government collapses, it is immediately replaced with another Government. So while a specific Government may end, if there is no Government whatsoever, then the State has collapsed.

Looking at an undergrad Intro to Comparative Politics textbook might be helpful. They're dry but usually pretty clear and have a glossary."

58,"Question in title.

I was curious after seeing the story on Biden having a sheet of paper in front of him with a reporter's question on it before she asked it. Initially when I read [the story](https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-caught-crib-notes-reporters-question-prior-calling-her-press-conference) on it I thought maybe that it was just a guideline and the actual question could be something else completely, but the reporter question was pretty close to what was on the sheet of paper, asking the same fundamental thing about a contradiction between Biden wanting to build up US manufacturing in a way that could conflict with building alliances with South Korea. Then I thought, if this is an actual scandal wouldn't it look really bad on the reporter for sharing the question in advance? But if this is just standard practice for US presidents dating back before Biden then I guess it's just business as usual. Thanks in advance for any responses.","It's not unheard of. Sometimes they want to make sure certain questions or issues are addressed so they try to figure out which reporters are interested in it or have questions related to that. Apparently Sarah Huckabee Sanders has done so before for Trump (before Trump just stopped having press briefings altogether).

https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-press-office-asked-journalists-advance-questions-report-2021-2

Part of the reason is because if you spring questions without letting the answerer at least know the topic, you're going to get a lot of punted answers and unanswered questions.

https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/feb/17/ask-politifact-are-white-house-press-briefings-sta/

With regards to the specific question, it's possible the White House figured this specific reporter would ask about this topic based on prior interaction. They knew she would be there, and based on past information or inquiries (she's in the WH press office) they figured she might want to know about this topic. The writing on the card did not exactly match, so at a minimum they only got the gist of the question, and aren't vetted word for word like a valedictorian speech."

So why is she railing against her own right to partake in the democratic process?

Also, women make up half the population, so wouldn't it be political suicide (either for her or for the party she supports) to marginalise such a huge segment of the population? Or has the concept of female suffrage become genuinely unpopular in the USA in recent years?

What other countries have the same strong lobbying influence as the Irish diaspora? The most obvious would be the Jewish diaspora (and I hope the comment section does not become very muddied after mentioning this).

62,"Just brainstorming, can a sitting Prime Minister use whatever authority he has to grant permanent residency to a person they “favored” ? (Maybe this person saved their lives or has some dirt against them)

If not, can they use what power they have to expedite a person’s application status?","Under the Citizenship Act, subsection 5(4), the relevant Minister (currently the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship) can grant citizenship to any person in special cases. Specifically,

> Despite any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of statelessness or of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.

Likewise, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act section 25.2,

> The Minister may, in examining the circumstances concerning a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, grant that person permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the foreign national complies with any conditions imposed by the Minister and the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations.

The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act authority is limited in Quebec (Quebec has extra authority over immigration compared to other provinces, so both Quebec and the federal Minister have to agree for the special cases handled under 25.2 if the person intends to settle in Quebec). The Citizenship Act authority has no such limits."
63,"Hi folks, from the UK here but the question is broadly applicable and seems relevant during the 'cozzy livs' - cost of living crisis.

I endlessly hear politicians rebuff criticism and questioning by saying ""We've increased spending on ..."", sometimes spitballing a *big sounding* number or no number at all.

Is this stuff relative to inflation at all?? It seems like the default is that spending will effectively go down if it stays the same, so they can 'increase spending' without effectively increasing it at all, or with it still being effectively less in terms of what it actually buys! I find this somewhat infuriating if they're regularly getting away with seeming to 'invest more' without actually doing so, so please enlighten me.","Politics 101, whatever is technically true but sounds best for the politician.

DeSantis didn't incarcerate anybody without a trial, and he isn't torturing anybody at Disney, and he didn't impose any criminal penalties on Disney because of their speech. All he did was sign an Act of the Florida Legislature that altered how a Floridian political subdivision operated. Which, he would argue, is his

Typically, if a politician is doing a bad enough job, only the voters are in charge of dismissing them.

The more generous reason: politicians often spend time between gathering with the rest of their peers and spending time back in their districts. In an ideal world they'd be able to vote safely and securely via remote access and spend all their time with their constituents, but most places don't have that set up (or have actively prohibited it).

Disallowing remote voting can be beneficial in that it allows shenanigans during times when the governing body is not meeting or when some members cannot attend for external reasons (ie calling a vote when everyone goes home).

So, the question is as stated in the title. People deposit their money in a bank, and the bank gives out loans with that money. The bank makes money off of these loans, which creates money in the economy.

However, the interest gained in checking and savings accounts is negligible. I think for the 5k I had in my bank last month, I got $0.19 in interest. If this money is being used to give out loans, then the bank is collecting interest on these loans. 

It feels like it would be fair if my money was being used to create money via interest on loans, I should get a portion of the interest. Maybe, $0.19 is that amount in the end, but I imagine that isn't the case. Am I wrong? If not, why are banks not required to share the ""created"" money with those helping create it?

I mean, just look at how LGBT folks were portrayed prior to the last two decades. They fringe, sexualized, campy. To be gay was like an entire archetype. Now? You've got very nuanced portrayals of sexuality everywhere on TV. 

Neutral: Maybe I'll sound a little crass, but the majority of people are... well, they don't really have concrete opinions. They'll follow whatever popular paradigm is most convenient. The same people that hated gays 10 years ago might love the gays now because it's no longer fashionable to hate gays. The same could be said of racists -- it's not fashionable to be racist. This doesn't stop people from dunking on the LGBT community in private, but I'd hardly call it hate. I'd just say that it's not really an issue that's important to most people, and so most people will go with what's convenient. At one point is convenient to be racist, homophobic, and/or sexist; now, it's a detriment. There's nothing to be gained, so people go with the politically expedient thing.

Negative Theory: My speculation is that the transgender community is taking the brunt of things on the LGBT community's behalf now. Outside of the LGBT, I think it's easy for straight folks to see the LGBT community as a monolith, but in truth it's incredibly fractious and full of internal conflict, tribalism, and whathaveyou. As you say, a decade or so ago, people were kind of divided on the gays, but then some time passed and the Transgenders took the spotlight, and now everyone that was wishy-washy on the gay community is now like ""hey, we're cool with gays, but THIS is too far!"" Stuff like this has been the way of progress for the last century -- the Overton Window gets shifted. One day we'll be saying ""okay, we've cool with transgenders, but THIS is too far!""

83,"Hi all. I’m an avid fan of the web game The Campaign Trail by Dan Bryan, which allows players to maneouver presidential campaigns across several different elections. The 1988 scenario makes several references to Bush’s “personal unpopularity”. Was this really the case during the 1988 election and if so, why? I understand that there was the Iran-Contra scandal but Bush was also a war hero, had decades of government experience and served under an immensely popular incumbent.

If so, why isn't it more common in presidential systems?","Are you referring to U.S. states that elect multiple statewide office holders, such as electing a governor, secretary of state, attorney general, and the like?

Assuming so, and whistling past the definition of ""better governance,"" it seems that 35/50 states elect the Secretary of State (an administrative office) and 43/50 states elect the attorney general, so, you'd have to compare.  With the Attorney General position, it looks like states as varied as California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Utah, etc. elect their AG, so there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern of success or failure based on that alone."
85," Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003, 9 months after the invasion started (and Baghdad had been seized even earlier). With that, the main objective of the war had been accomplished: The regime was removed, the alleged threat of WMD was no more and the path was clear for the US to establish a democratic system. At this point, the damage done to the country and the civilian deaths were relatively low compared to what would come in the following years. It would be fair to say that up until late 2003/early 2004, the operation was a success. Even if the pretext for it was wrong, the US removed a brutal dictator and had an actual opportunity to transform not only Iraq, but also the entire region into more democratic and progressive systems. So what exactly went wrong from there on? Why has the opposite happened? I don't want to argue about whether the war itself was wrong or not, I'm just trying to understand why what the US attempted did not work, even though the opportunity was there at one point.","There are many many words, pages and books written about all the pitfalls and mistakes the USA did after toppling Saddam.  One of most common mistakes you'll hear was the USA policy of De-Ba'athification and disbanding of the Iraqi army.  This greatly destabilized Iraq, as hundreds of thousands of government workers and military personnel, were now unemployed which not only made it hard for the Iraq government to carry out its basic duties, it made the Sunni population feel like it was being left out of the new Iraqi government.

Excellent set of videos: https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process","In the Senate, there can technically be any number of amendments proposed on a bill, and a vote can only occur once all discussion is over. The problem is that any senator can filibuster - delay a vote indefinitely by claiming that they need more time to discuss the bill. Under the current Senate rules, senators don't even need to keep talking to keep a filibuster going. Unless the senator withdraws their motion to filibuster, the only way to move on to a vote is for the majority to hold cloture - where 60+ senators vote to end discussion.

The rules of the Senate are enforced by the Senate Parliamentarian - a non-senator acting as ref. They decide whether bills are ""policy"" or ""spending,"" which affects how quickly bills will pass through the process. Policy bills can be stopped from reaching a final vote by filibuster, whereas spending bills can't and get to go to a vote without cloture being needed."

Most people would perceive, say, Bernies Sanders as sticking to his principles however. Even if you disagree with his views, the man's consistent. I don't know how wealthy his background is, but to run a good presidential campaign you've got to be absurdly wealthy, and that requires... donors. Maybe you can grassroots that with your followers, but is that really enough?","""Sticking to principles"" isn't a very mature way of understanding politicians. Why is Sanders more principled than, say, Biden or Buttigieg or Klobuchar? Simply having more extreme political views or liking less popular things isn't inherently virtuous. Further, from a certain angle, supporting something only because voters ask you to do it kind of does have a certain amount of inherent virtue in democracy.

What this ""money corrupts principles"" thing usually comes down to isn't actually a corruption of principles. People point out how folks get big donations from oil companies and also are not supportive of green initiatives. But establishing a causal link here is actually quite difficult.

Ukrainians trade enemy Russian prisoners to get some of their own captured troops back.  It's been widely reported that those Russian prisoners are then often [executed by sledgehammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Yevgeny_Nuzhin) for desertion.

I have two questions about this:

- Are Russia's sledgehammer executions of deserters war crimes, or considered illegal under international law?  Or is it a legitimate (but despicable) exercise of Russia's right as a sovereign country to define crimes, judicial processes and punishments as it sees fit?
- If the executions are war crimes / against international law, is Ukraine making itself an accomplice to those crimes by participating in the exchanges while knowing that the result of the exchanges will be additional sledgehammer executions?  Or does the guilt solely attach to Russia in this situation?","You are mixing things up that need correction before your questions can be answered.

Russia (all their crimes aside) is *not* executing their returned PoWs. The Wagner Group does it, which is 1. *not* officially a part of the Russian Army and 2. is technically an illegal organization even by Russian law. Now, the fact that they are still around and are involved with the Russian Army is a wholly different thing. However, members of the Wagner Group are not considered combatants by international law and as such are not accorded the same protections and rights as ""proper"" PoWs. Prisoner exchanges of Wagner members are also negotiated between Ukraine and the Wagner Group, not Ukraine and Russia, while prisoner exchanges of Russian soldiers actually happen between Ukraine and Russia. As far as the international community is aware, Ukraine is treating both groups (Russian Pows and Wagner members) the same.

In Nuzhin's case, it is unclear whether he ultimately agreed to be returned or not, but there certainly was no way to know what would happen to him. There are varying stories out there. But generally, obtaining a signed agreement from the PoW to be exchanged is a good practise and Ukrainian officials claim to have obtained a written agreement from Nuzhin.

Reportedly, Wagner expressed a wish to exchange Nuzhin for twenty Ukrainian PoW after Nuzhin gave interviews (while in capticity) where he slandered Putin and claimed to regret joining Wagner. However, considering Nuzhin's shady past (he was serving a sentence for murder when he was recruited into Wagner), many people were not buying it. There was no way to know whether he was being genuine, hence the question (after the fact) whether he singned an agreement to be exchanged ot not.

Now here's the thing: each state is first and foremost responsible for the wellbeing of its citizens, both legally and morally. You'd think that Russia would be interested in returning their own citizens safely. We know that's not... quite... the case, but as far as we are aware, Russia itself is ""simply"" being negligent in trying to return its citizens, rather than actively harming them once they're returned (other than potentially sending them back to the frontlines). By that same logic, Ukraine's main goal in the exchange is (rightfully) returning its own citizens home. Considering that Russian PoWs have, at least in theory, the opportunity to refuse the exchange, one can assume that any that are exchanged have agreed to it, which ultimately absolves Ukraine of whatever happens afterwards (of course, no way for us to be 100% sure in every single case). By that same logic, anyone who has agreed to be returned to the Wagner Group, well... I guess they could apply for asylum if particularly desperate, however anyone who is a member of the Wagner Group is by definition a criminal under international law since the Wagner Group is an illegal organization, making their chances rather slim."

95,"By ""rural Western states,"" I'm referring to Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming and Idaho.

Montana is pretty red, but Democrats perform markedly better there than the surrounding states, and I can't figure out why.

Do we know why Montana is pretty Democratic given its place in the region?","In presidential elections democrat performance in Montana has been declining since the 2008 Obama - McCain election. Giving it a cursory glance I see two big factors that I think explain how democrats do in Montana. 

1. You're on the right track with looking into demographics; Native Americans are major supporters of the Democratic Party in Montana. They form one of three Democrat strongholds. Without looking at the Dakotas, I'd say that the extra two democrat pockets in addition to Native populations explain the difference in performance. The extra two pockets of democratic voters are students at the University of Montana and at Montana Tech.
2. Since I think that the students at the two universities are the reason Montana democrats get a boost compared to their neighbors, I would expect to see a strong correlation between how a Democratic presidential candidate performs in Montana and how they perform among youth nationally. That correlation seems to hold; Obama did very well with youth voters in 2008 and less well in 2012. Clinton did alright with voting youth in 2016 but Bernie did better, and youth turnout for Clinton was depressed in the general election as a result. We can see that Bernie outperformed Clinton in Montana. And finally youth votes went up for Biden compared to Clinton, as did Democratic performance in Montana. 

So basically, you've got a bunch of young people on your two major college campuses, so when the democrats get young people excited, they get more votes in Montana."

97,"Hi all, Mearsheimer has a famously simple, and compelling, view of international politics, which is essentially great powers will act in expected ways to preserve their power and regional influence. That’s why the US wouldn’t tolerate Mexico or Canada becoming closely aligned with China, and nor according to this line of thinking should we expect Russian to allow its neighbours to align with the west.

I think there’s plenty of ways you can critique this general lens of IR, but i find it harder to respond specifically to the challenge that the west may be hypocritical in protecting its own sphere of influence while disregarding other powers’ spheres.

Id be interested to hear what might be a good response to this challenge.","*edited for formatting*

This is going to be pretty long, and I apologize. I am a PhD candidate in IR, so I have some experience in dealing with these arguments, and this subject.

Tl;dr:  Why is it more problematic for the US to attempt to have good diplomatic relations with Ukraine, but seemingly ok for Russia to invade in order to prevent that? Ukraine is a state with its own security considerations, and a legitimate actor in global politics. It is not up to Russia or the US to determine what they are and are not allowed to do, and Russia intervening militarily violates this, and about a dozen other well-established norms.

Skip down to the end for a summary of coutner-arguments if you don't care about the explanations for everything.

>i find it harder to respond specifically to the challenge that the west may be hypocritical in protecting its own sphere of influence while disregarding other powers’ spheres.

There is quite a bit of hypocrisy, and at some level it comes down to global norms. We as a population, and the international system more broadly, tend to have less issue with the US and the West doing things that Russia does because the norms were created by the US and its allies to reflect their actions. The US argues that they are trying to preserve democracy, which many populations can agree is mostly a good thing, while Russia is obviously not doing that. While at a base level they are doing the same thing, the norms the US invokes are more popular and generally supported than what Russia is doing.

Now, is there hypocrisy? Absolutely. The US has a history of overthrowing democratically elected governments (see Central America and Iran). They actively support Israel, claiming it is a democracy, depsite the UN rapporteur and various NGOs describing it as an apartheid state. However, that hypocrisy does not mean that every single thing they do is wrong. The US can be bad actors in many cases and still be right in others, they are not mutually exclusive. So to answer your question, I would say that simply acknowledging the hypocrisy is a fine thing to do. Two things can be bad at the same time - Russian imperialism and American imperialism. Placing the blame on the west directly downplays the role of Russian imperialism in this war against Ukraine.

>should we expect Russian to allow its neighbours to align with the west.

The argument that I make is that Ukraine is not a play-thing for great powers. If you take traditional IR theory approaches, this holds true in almost every case. Even realism (what Mearsheimer attempts to use) would suggest that all states are self-interested (not just great powers), and will do what is best for their own security. His argument, simply put, is that the US and the West goaded Russia into this by getting closer to Ukraine, and Russia's self-interested, security-based response was to stop it via force. 

However, is Ukraine not also a state with its own security considerations? Ukraine is a democratic state that, when threatened, will do what it needs to do in order to protect its security. In this case, they are moving toward the West for security guarantees. This move West is also based in norms (democracy, liberalism, etc.) but to me it is no more complicated than Ukraine being a legitimate actor in the world and doing what it feels is necessary to protect itself. Why is Ukraine always excluded from these discussions when they are the ones being invaded? Why are Russia and the US the only states anybody talks about, when there is a third, relatively large state at play here? Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 should be all the evidence anybody needs to understand why Ukraine wants to be closer to the West.

Given that we do have globally established norms (like the norm of non-intervention, and the norms that you cannot acquire territory or alter borders by force), the case for Russia being in the wrong is clearly present.

>What is the best counter-argument to this?

For me there are a few. To summarize:
1)That is a completely hyperbolic argument. Since the end of the Cold War there are actually very few such cases of this happening (at least that we know of). It doesn't matter if we *think* the US won't tolerate it, we *know* Russia will go to extreme lengths to prevent it. These are not the same.

2) Ukraine is a sovereign state that can do what it pleases. If that means turning to the West, so be it. If Russia wants better relations with the West (which I am convinced it does not, but that's a separate issue), it is up to them to be adults and not invade a country if it gets too close to the other ""side"". Russia themselves push states away with their rhetoric and actions, and Ukraine turning to the west is a natural conclusion of this.

3) Mearsheimer purports to use realism for his analyses, and he talks about rhetoric and discourse of pro-NATO sentiments in Ukraine. But in realist conceptions of state action, discourse and rhetoric don't matter at all. So the argument that ""Ukraine saying they want to join NATO is enough to make Russia invade"" is absolute nonsense, because realists don't believe in words, just actions. And Ukraine has never had a chance of joining NATO, nor do they in a million years.

4) Mearsheimer wrote a piece called ""The False Promise of International Institutions"" and in it, decried their ability to have influence in global politics. But I guess NATO, an international institution, is the exception? Either institutions are weak and powerless, or extremely influential and powerful, but they can't be both.

5) Mearsheimer's argument is inherently hypocritical. ""It is the US' fault for bringing Ukraine into its sphere of influence!"" But I thought that great powers acted in their self-interest? So it's wrong for the US to be diplomatically friendly with Ukraine, but I guess it's fine for Russia to use an overwhelming military intervention to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence? His argument is just so thin, and not even logically coherent.

6) My final response is rooted not as much in Mearsheimer's argument, but just in reality more broadly. Look at Putin's own writings from before the invasion - he barely talks about threats from the West or NATO. His focus is on ""the mistakes of Lenin"" in devolving power to Ukraine (or as Putin calls it, ""The Periphery""). He does not believe Ukraine is a legitimate state, and in his ""manifesto"" calls for its restoration into Russia. This is imperialism, full stop. Putin is an imperialist, and the argument that it's all America's fault completely ignores that core fact, and itself is entirely hypocritical. If it is wrong for the west to be imperialistic, it is also wrong for Russia to be. Russia is as much an actor with its own objectives and ambitions, and placing all the blame on the west is just a weak argument.

I’m not sure about senators, but some high ranking officials are able to effectively have a “office at home”, which includes some means of accessing and storing classified information. However, the rules still apply for storing and handling classified info.

The President and Vice President are at a high enough level where they would absolutely have their private home re-modeled to store classified info. What they should have done (and didn’t) is take only the information they needed at the moment, then when they were done return it to the specific container it belongs to. They should have staff responsible for ensuring that all materials in that container are eventually returned to a secure facility. 

Unfortunately, this is an issue that plagues the national security ecosystem in general, and given that most senior officials haven’t been indoctrinated like their staff are, lapses in procedures are bound to happen. 

Biden and Pence’s staff did the correct thing and immediately reported the classified information to the National Archives and DOJ. Any discovery of improperly handled materials must be reported.

My prediction is that, based on their cooperation, the officials that cooperate will be hit with a fine (which is negligible, but proves that this lapse still has consequences)."
105,"So with all of the rancor lately between republicans and democrats in the US House of Representatives, spilling into votes to kick members off committees, what stops the majority party from just kicking all of the minority off the committees?  Is there some kind of legal construct in play that prevents it, or is it simply a professional courtesy?","To my understanding there is no legal issue preventing the majority from kicking the minority party off committees in general; or at least there's no constitutional issue with it.  The specific rules of the House adopted each session may contain some restrictions, but I haven't heard of any, and they could certainly be changed if the majority were willing to change it.

I'm not sure I'd call it 'courtesy' that they do not do so.  But a form of institutional inertia may apply; there are some rules that have been as they are for a very long time, and there is reluctance to change them.  It's also the case that when misdeeds are done on topics like this, it's often by pushing at the borders rather than by truly blatantly changing things.  So one would want a rationalization and/or allegedly good reason before doing so.  It also means that from a political standpoint, it's safer to do more limited removals like the Republicans did on Omar rather than to take more general action.  It's easier to justify it to themselves, and easier for their base to rationalize, if it's more limited.  There's also of course the fear that the other side will do the same to you, which undoubtedly has some effect.

One simple reason not to remove people is that the majority party already gives itself the majority in each committee generally, so as long as they agree with each other they can already do what they want with the committee.  As such there's far less reason to bother kicking people out regardless of the situation."

This is just one example of several that I've seen in recent history. How can someone in a position of power within government order the end to a strike? Clearly the teachers are trying to get something and someone in power saying that they should return to their job doesn't resolve the issue. Is it a question of what their contracts require? Surely the teachers union has some sort of provision for striking. Also, Massachusetts is employment at will so there would not be a specific term for their employment called out and that agreement (I'm assuming).

Greatly appreciate the assistance on this","It is not illegal to strike. However, it may be *unlawful*.

The distinction is that if a strike is lawful, workers have certain protections. Most notably that their jobs will be waiting for them when the strike is over. If a strike is unlawful, their employer can simply fire them and hire replacements.

In Massachusetts (and some other states), public sector employees are not allowed to strike. If you walk off your job, you're not 'striking'. You're just quitting without notice. If you encourage others to collectively walk of the job, you can be fired for that conduct even if you remained at your post.

So basically what the judge is saying is that if they want to quit their jobs, they can. But if they want to continue working for the Commonwealth, they need to show up to work."
108,"To run for US Congress, a candidate has to have a committee, which I think are usually LLCs. But an LLC can be a subsidiary of another LLC parent company or holding company. Are there any rules about a political LLC (specifically a candidate committee) having a parent or holding LLC?

I haven’t been able to find any information online at the federal level, so please include sources if you have them!","A campaign committee is usually a non-profit tax exempt organization. It is not an LLC, and is usually not required to have any specific type of organization (but it usually just called a PAC. In order to run for office, you can usually just file with your state or the federal campaign commission, and then take that paperwork to the bank to open an account.

109,"Unsure about this one, I've heard different opinions.","When the U.S. liberated Kuwait in the early 90s, there was never a formal cessation of hostilities despite the popular belief that the 'war was over'. Rather, the U.S. continued to provide security guarantees in the area and the Iraqis kept shooting (albeit rather ineffectually) at U.S. troops.

So the invasion of Iraq was merely a resumption of active hostilities. Moreover, it was a resumption of active hostilities favored by the Clinton Administration because it was deemed necessary to resolve the conflict. However, the Clinton Administration had no way to sell a full-scale invasion to the American public so it was never seriously discussed as an option - the same way the Clinton Administration was willing to launch perfunctory airstrikes at Al Qaeda facilities in places like Afghanistan and Sudan but not to commit ground troops.

Then 9/11 occurs. This provided the Bush Administration with a rationale for resolving the Iraq conflict that the Clinton Administration lacked. Moreover, by this point Saddam Hussein had ordered the resumption of the Iraqi development of nuclear weapons. Curiously enough, these orders would never be acted upon because his subordinates found it impossible to pursue nuclear weapons under the sanctions regime and simply lied to him about their progress.

Western intelligence agencies would learn about these lies but not the fact that they *were* lies. As a result, the consensus of Western intelligence was that Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons.

Given the ability to muster popular support behind an invasion, the perceived need to stop the development of nuclear weapons and the interminable ongoing conflict, a decision was reached to invade Iraq. Note that this decision would have likely occurred regardless of who was in the White House.

In terms of Bush's attitude towards Hussein, it's impossible to know. However, it's likely that Bush didn't view Hussein as any more innately evil than most other authoritarian rulers of his ilk - indeed, he probably viewed him as substantially less 'evil' than the regimes in places like Iran and North Korea because Hussein didn't base his entire power structure on a mythology of opposition to the West. In terms of political gains, there really weren't any in the partisan sense. The invasion could potentially lead to a more stable international order, but it wasn't going to provide any meaningful benefit to Bush himself."

Although many democracies are bicameral, almost all federal countries have it, but it is more split half and half between bicameral and unicameral for unitary states.

As per the title, why democratic countries don't help more substantially protesters in Iran or anti junta forces in Myanmar? 

I understand country self determination is very important but isn't having a democracy in interest of everyone, both people that protest and democracies that help?

The CIA provided arms and training in their use to a small group of rebels in Afghanistan, the Mujahedeen. These later became the Taliban. Perky little upstarts, weren't they?

One of the issues with supplying rebels is in discovering what their actual agenda is. Rebel groups come and go and morph into other forms as a matter of necessity. They are also susceptible to being subverted by other groups. This is much more difficult to do with a ""government in exile"" or a challenger who may have lost an election fairly or otherwise. Their agenda is generally pretty well established, and this can lend an air of legitimacy to an arms provider. Consider, for instance, the Colombian rebels who were supplied arms by the CIA and how Ronald Reagan referred to them as ""freedom fighters"". The fact that payment was made in cocaine was disregarded until the Iran-Contra Congressional hearings."

117,"Wilson was certainly a visionary thinking of how to create a new world  order. However, Congress was low to tie the United States into the  League of Nations and so it shot it down. I'm wondering what practical  reasons they had leaving the us out of the league of nations?","The US generally had a policy of ""isolationism"" prior to WWII. Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 on a platform of remaining ""neutral"" in WWI. He walked back that promise only after he was elected and put the US in WWI after he was re-elected.

So when WWI ended, many politicians wanted the US to return to isolationism, and were afraid entering into the League of Nations would drag the US into European and other foreign conflicts. So while Wilson helped set up the organization, his pleas for the US to join were rejected by Congress who preferred to return to the pre-WWI mindset of isolationism.

That was the major reason for the US failing to join after WWI."

It seems like we’ve had a lot of Autocratic-thinking republicans coming through, I’m curious why they’re supporting something that seems so democratic?","There are two main things to unpack here. First, the spectrum of autocratic vs. democratic isn't really a real thing. That's basically borrowing from the political compass, which is complete hokum, to put it kindly. The opposite of democracy is not authority. In fact, every system of government actually depends on authority to a certain extent, *especially* democracy. If you did some better study and read some quality political books, this will never be a real axis around which to think about political cleavages. It's purely something made up by libertarians to make them sound better.

Second, term limits aren't really being pushed by anyone who has any understanding of how political behavior actually works and wants it to be effective. Gaetz and crew are anti-government extremists, and when the other side has had folks that are also anti-government extremists then they have both considered this kind of thing, but it's almost objectively a *terrible* idea.

124,"One of the concessions made was that debt ceiling raises must be coupled with spending cuts. This is likely to turn into a huge point of contention with The Senate and threaten a catastrophic default on US debts. Let's say McCarthy was faced with this, and decided to just ignore that promise and go ahead with a ""clean"" debt ceiling bill. Does anything actually prevent him from doing this other than reputational harm?","Well, if he doesn't do what he promised, and doesn't immediately write the rules in the fashion he said he would, then he would likely find the 20 holdouts will go right back to holding out as soon as the House does anything. The thing preventing McCarthy from reneging is that he has to get their votes in order to effectively govern. This is why a short-term deal with the Dems to resolve the Speaker crisis wasn't going to work. Electing a Speaker isn't just about getting a guy in the seat, it's about determining a governing majority that can carry a majority of votes most of the time, and basically of the time on very routine issues. McCarthy lying and just doing what he wants would end his governing majority AND end his chances of ever getting it back."

126,"In his book World Order, Kissinger describes collective security as being a policy failure. It both exacerbated minor conflicts and was impotent to stop major ones from taking place. Kissinger uses the dismantling of Czechoslovakia as being one example of the failure of collective security. I don't quite understand what these two policies actually meant in practice and would welcome someone with a bigger brain than me to explain.","I haven't read World Order, so perhaps my explanation is different than what Kissinger has in mind. 

In US political discourse the term alliance has at times had a negative connotation based on the warning about 'entangling alliances' by George Washington. An alliance can be seen as negative, because a state will have to go to war in case an allied country is attacked, otherwise an alliance is meaningless. That means you can get sucked into someone else's war. With warfare being quite common between European powers historically, that is quite a risk. 

Wilson tried to sell his vision for the world after World War I in the form of his Fourteen points plan and the League of Nations. The distinction he made between ordinary or the old form of alliances and the new form is that the former was between two or a few states, whereas the latter is an alliance between all (or at least many) (democratic) states. The collective security element is that if one of these countries is attacked, all other allied states respond as if they were attacked at the same time by the aggressor state. Does this explanation make it clearer?

What I think Kissinger is arguing is that it is a nice idea, but does not necessarily work in practice. One question that was asked in France on the eve of World War II was: ""Pourquoi mourir pour Dantzig?"", ""Why die for Danzig/Gdansk?"". In short, why would you want to send your own men to their death for a war between foreign countries? The assumption is that these allied foreigners would also send their men in case your own country is attacked, but why would they? Is that a realistic promise? In the case of Munich '38 it showed that the Western powers were not willing to send their troops against Nazi Germany over the Sudetenland, even if Czechslovakia was formally their ally. This of course only emboldened Hitler to invade Poland as well."

128,I’m curious because I’ve read various things about how China is creating debt traps and also about how the trade is beneficial for both China and the various nations.,"There are two primary lenses to look at this, a moral one and a realpolitik one.

The moral one answers the ethical question of the goodness inherent in an act. The second answers the question of power advantage. 

From an ethical standpoint, minus the question of loan terms, this is a good thing for the African continent which needs capital to develop. 

From a realpolitik standpoint, China believes it has much to gain by developing influence in the region and I believe this to be true. Through its lack of a colonial past, China enters Africa with less skepticism than (white) western powers and is able to develop favorable relationships with many African nations though its unrestricted initiatives. This relationship improves its access to raw materials, and forms closer ties with a part of the world expected to develop significantly this century (dubbed,  ""The Century of Africa""). 

China knows it will be the world's strongest power as a matter of course, and they not only have many enemies and threats but must develop friendly ties and allies for support. Others here far better versed than me may speak more to the geopolitical advantage gained at such minor cost to China, but it is certainly a small price to pay for the support."
129,"Since the Republicans control the house, the speaker isn’t going to be a democrat regardless. And McCarthy seems more moderate than some of the other options.","It's not just about having a person in the seat. It's about building a governing coalition, which means being able to command a majority, most of the time, especially on very basic matters. The Speaker ceremony is important because it's literally the most foundational possible thing a governing coalition can do, and it shows that a leader has the ability to get a majority. But right now, the Reps can't even pass that test.

If the Dems did help McCarthy get elected, what would be the point? The minute McCarthy tried to call his first vote, this would still happen. All it does is punt the problem down the road, or force the Dems to constantly be in a position where they are helping McCarthy do the job in a way the Dems don't agree with. What's the point of that? 

Now, if McCarthy approached the Dems about a plan to gain some of their support in exchange for concessions about how he would lead his governing coalition, then we'd have a different story. Then it would make sense, depending on the deal, for Dems to join McCarthy's efforts to lead. But McCarthy has made no such overtures, and rather still plans to explicitly keep the Dems out of his governing coalition as much as humanly possible. Why would the Dems be leaping up to prop him up in that case? Especially when he can't even lead his own party?

This is actually not really about partisanship at all. It's about the basic math of democracies need to carry majorities to be able to function, and right now McCarthy can't clear that bar on the most basic, most simple of issues. The Dems helping McCarthy on one vote won't fix that fundamental issue unless they were willing to help him out on lots more votes...which obviously isn't a reasonable expectation."

For example, the most prominent country which hasn't signed the 1968 Vienna treaty are the United States. From searching online, it is suggested that the reason why the States have not signed this treaty is because federal government cannot mandate standardized driver's licenses, as set out by the treaty.

131,"If I'm reading [this chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_divisions_of_United_States_Congresses#Party_divisions_by_Congress) correctly, the Democrats held the House majority for 60 of 64 years between 1931 and 1995.  Even the Senate was mostly Democratic majority during this same time period.  

What is the reason for their dominance?","Let's start back at the Civil War. After Reconstruction ended, the Republicans enjoyed a similar span of dominance. Part of this was due to the fact that the South was effectively excluded from voting for a long period of time and part of it was due to how Civil War pensions gave Republicans a strong base of support.

However, the Republican Party started splintering between various wings in the early days of the 20th century, giving Democrats an opening. Coupled with the 'Solid South' that delivered reliable Democratic votes, this improved their chances.

At the same time, the Democrats had their own problem. They were essentially two different parties: the Southern Democrats and the Northern Democrats. The problem was that the Southern Democrats were an obstacle to electoral success in the North. However, once the Great Depression hit, the lack of effective response from Republicans coupled with Democratic promises of generous federal social programs made them more competitive in the North - especially amongst black voters who were otherwise unwilling to vote for the party of slavery/Jim Crow.

This 'FDR coalition' would last for the next few decades. However, while Jim Crow may have been politically unpalatable outside of the South, it did prove to be a substantial barrier to the South joining the rest of the nation economically. Once Jim Crow fell (and, arguably, air conditioning technology became more widespread), the South stopped being 'solid' for the Democrats and the parties started forming into more balanced insiders vs. outsiders dynamic."

138,"In a New York Times article from July 2nd 1867 (the day after Canada became a country) It quotes the governor general of Canada as saying:
“We are to show the whole world – and especially that other population in the Americas – what a representative government is. If we fail we shall have no choice but to fall under democratic rule ""
Then later: ""democratic rule may be the worst system of tyranny , because the mere brute force of the majority bears down and tramples the rights of the minority”
once again: “we are doing a true service to the Americans. We are teaching them the advantage to our form of government over theirs”
so my question is: how did their governments differ? what was America's government considered in 1867? it seems to be a representative government, and a democracy today.. wouldn't it be considered the same back in 1867?
The Article: https://tinyurl.com/2drze3ys","Okay so I feel like I'm pretty qualified to answer all this. I am Canadian, I've worked in parliament, and I studied both political science and history. Finally, my time has come. 

Americans think Canada is some magical place a lot of the time. That's obviously not true, but not a ton of Canadian news filters down to Americans so the image sticks. We are absolutely more authoritarian than the United States and always have been. Where people get confused is that it's also a lot more left wing than the US. 

For example. The father of the current prime minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, once called the job of the prime minister: ""a dictator with a smile"". In reference to the fact that there are precious few checks on the PM's powers. You may not think of the office of the President as being constrained by the legislature and courts, but compared to Canada, it is absolutely kneecapped. Part of this is due to the fact that there is no office of the Prime Minister in the same way that there is an Office of the President. The Prime Minister is both the PM and the leader of his party in the legislature. This means that if he wants a bill passed, he gets his party to pass it exactly as he likes. The reason that matters is because if he is the Prime Minister, it also means his party has a majority government in the House, and will be able to pass the bill without problems. (Not dealing with the exceptions for now). There is no seperate election for Prime Minister. The guy with all the power in the legislature gets all the power in the Executive, all of the time. Our Senate is just a rubber stamping machine because they're appointed by the Prime Minister. 

The provinces do have some power over the Federal government, but the federal government has pretty reliable ways around those divisions of powers if they need to. For example, any time a province moves towards restricting abortion, the feds can pull the 1/3 of healthcare funding that comes from the federal government. Considering healthcare is usually the #1 expenditure from provincial governments already, it's an extremely effective threat. So despite the fact that on paper, healthcare is a provincial matter, it's all kept on the straight and narrow by the feds. 

Another example, the recent trucker's protests. The federal government was fed up that the provinces weren't acting so they (among other things) nationalized the police force. 

The USA doesn't have a lot of that, and the list keeps going. I know it's trendy to say the US is authoritarian, and maybe it's even trending that way, idk. But you guys are coming from a place of a much deeper rooted sense of individual freedom and autonomy than Canada does historically. 

I mean, until 1982, we literally didn't have a supreme court, it was still a court in Britain. And even then, out supreme court is also appointed by the Prime Minister, and we aren't even required to have hearings like you do in the US. The US system isn't exactly good by any means, but that's still leaps and bounds more accountability than Canada's system. 

Yeah, we have healthcare and a stronger social safety net and generally more social programs. But don't confuse a left/right axis with an authoritarian axis, as much as I hate the political compass. Canada is a much more centralized government system than the United States, and it's not close."
139,"I live in Sweden. We have taken in hundreds of thousands of immigrants and have millions of 2nd and 3rd generation children of immigrants. 
Since 2015 immigrant wave of Syrians and other nationalities violent crime  has skyrocketed like shootings, explosions and rape. Also ""security"" is at its lowest aka people feel unsafe. Integration is bad and I think majority of responsibility goes to the immigrants because majority of swedes didnt want this. Buy the swedish goverment also failed by setting too low requirements on immigrants like learning Swedish and swe culture. By doing that they make immigrants dependent on welfare which has created parallell societes in Sweden like Somalitown etc. 

Anyways here was some background information on why multiculturalism does not work in Sweden so back to my original question. 

Does multiculturalism work in a liberal democracy without an iron fist?","Okay. There's a lot to unpack here.

First of all, be careful when generalizing about a whole group of people, especially without solid statistics. You might be surprised to find out that, in the United States, immigrants on average commit crime at lower rates than people born in the country (if you ask, I can try to find the study). I don't know what the statistics would be for Sweden, but that gets to my second point.

People are the product of their environment. Crime is born not out of someone's essence, but out of their desperation. Getting into the US is hard, but staying is potentially easier than in much of Europe. The US' lingua franca is English, which is already widely learned as an auxiliary language (a quarter of the world's population can speak English). Swedish has a fraction of as many speakers, meaning more immigrants will have to go through more language training than if they'd immigrated to a country that uses a widely-understood international language, such as Mandarin, French or Arabic.

As much as cultural conflicts rage on in my country's politics, immigration from Germany, Ireland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Latin America and elsewhere has slowly been changing the idea of what being ""American"" means. It used to always mean ""British-descended Caucasian, Protestant, etc."" Nowadays many, myself included, believe being ""American"" is more about the choices you make, not whomever you're descended from or whatever you believe in. That attitude change has gone hand-in-hand with a greater tolerance of multiple cultures, faiths and heritages than ever before in my country's history. I suspect Sweden has not had those waves of immigration opening up the idea of what it means to be ""Swedish."" If anything, Sweden's historical interactions with other European powers have probably caused a hardening of Swedish identity to distinguish it from that of its neighbors.

When the Mafia controlled the Italian-American communities in the early 20th Century, it was often because young men in those communities couldn't get legal work from willing employers. When the cartels of today get away with murder in Latino-American neighborhoods, it's often because of the fear that someone's gonna get deported if the police get involved. Xenophobia breeds crime and lets it fester. If crime really is higher among the Syrian immigrant population of Sweden, I believe a homogeneous image of ""Swedishness"" and outright prejudice are most to blame."
140,"It seems that on both the left and right of the US political spectrum, there are groups of people who are vocally against supporting Ukraine in their defense against Russia's invasion. I sort of assumed that many right-leaning folks held this position simply because it opposes the current Democratic party position.

But I also see a segment of left-leaning folks who are also against US support of Ukraine. In particular, there's an up-and-coming third party called the [People's Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_a_People%27s_Party) who is left leaning and is strongly against supporting Ukraine in their defense against Russia. They also support ending NATO. Supporters include political commentator Jimmy Dore and former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, as well as voice actor Greg Cipes. It sounds like these folks also tend to use phrases like ""Plandemic"" in reference to the events of the past few years, and overall tend towards right-wing rhetoric when discussing recent events. I know they're a small political party, but I've started seeing more social media discussion around their events and ideology, so it's becoming relevant.

This has led to a lot of questions:

* For folks who either support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, or simply don't support any US efforts to support Ukraine's defense against Russia, how is it that some left and right wing folks agree on this? Where is it coming from?
* Is there a connection between opposing Ukraine and being susceptible to conspiracy theories, religious/spiritual thinking, or simply anti-government sentiment?
* How does NATO factor into this? Is supporting/opposing NATO usually divided along party lines, or is it more complicated?
* Many of these folks use catchphrases like ""End the war in Ukraine"" to get people to oppose US support of Ukraine against Russia. From my perspective, Russia invaded Ukraine, so ""ending the war"" just means letting Russia invade and annex its neighbors, right? Are they explicitly supporting Russian imperialism and hoping the rest of us don't notice?","A few possibilities:

1. General anti-war sentiment/isolationism. If you're on the fringe-left, support for Ukraine might look like an excuse to pump money into the military industrial complex and perpetuate war. On the right one might see it as wasting resources on something that isn't obviously in the national interest. 
2. Skepticism of ""the establishment""; which I'll define here as career politicians (e.g. senior congressional leaders + well known centrist figures from both parties) and experienced civil servants. This is something that's common on both the far-left and far-right, which you can see for things like vaccine skepticism and yes, belief in certain conspiracy theories. As financial support for Ukraine is something supported by both the center-left and center-right establishment, certain people on the fringes will naturally be skeptical. As an aside, I think the invasion of Iraq (and to a lesser extent Afghanistan) really damaged the credibility of US foreign policy institutions (think CIA, DoD, and associated think tanks/individuals) in a way that they haven't quite recovered from.
3. I think support for NATO is also more divided along fringe/centrist lines as opposed to party lines. Trump's presidency did weird things here, like make the right softer on Russia and likely add more conservatives to the anti-NATO camp (though to be clear most congressmen on the center-right still support NATO). 
4. To your last question, I think some of this is recasting the war in Ukraine as a ""proxy war"" between the US and Russia, in a way that removes moral responsibility for the war from Russia and presents the US and Russia as approximately equally culpable. I'm not sure how much of this is actually done in good faith..."
141,"I want to preface this by saying that, as a Jewish person, I have no problem with Christmas being a national holiday, but I have always wondered how can Christmas, explicitly a Christian holiday (and I am not really interested in the argument that it is not, it just is) not a violation of the establishment clause. (in particular, it seems to violate the first and second prongs of the Lemon test). Have there been any cases around this?","It looks a lot less like an endorsement if you think about it in terms of accommodating free expression of religion (which is also in the 1A).

It's not a ""national holiday"" but rather a day that the federal government, as an employer, is closed for business. If you're going to lose a critical mass of your workforce due to most of them taking annual leave to observe a holiday, perhaps it's easier to simply close for business than run on a skeleton crew.

143,From what i understand trump signed it into law in 2020 so biden had the legal right to end it. What rights and justifacation does the scotus have to get involved?,"There are two competing lawsuits.

During the Trump administration, a lawsuit was filed by advocacy groups saying that the implementation of Title 42 violated the rights of asylum seekers, and that the Trump administration had not convincingly proved there was a health risked posed by said asylum seekers. When the Biden administration announced plans to repeal the rule, Republican-led states filed their own lawsuit, saying the Biden administration had not properly allowed for notice-and-comment, and that the states would have objected to the repeal of the policy due to the likely increase of immigration increase a repeal would have.

One panel [ruled in favour of the ACLU and other groups](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/16/title-42-migrants-court-ruling/), another judge [ruled in favour of the Republican states](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/20/title-42-border-judge-ruling-migrants/). It is up to SCOTUS to adjudicate these competing claims and potentially answer all of the legal questions at hand (was Title 42 really in the interest of public health, were the proper procedures followed by the Biden administration, etc.)."

145,"The trope of the moment seems to be that we're sleepwalking towards extreme authoritarianism. But has that ever really happened to a Liberal Democracy?

I don't just mean a Liberal Democracy going through a period of being seen as hypocritical in its use of power, or a government in a LibDem nation that's falling behind the times on social progress, or even a government that gives preferential treatment to the voices that support and propagate them. I mean a Hitler or Stalin level of tyranny that came about from an authoritarian ideology sweeping through a state practicing a post-WWII brand of Liberalism.

Has anything resembling that ever happened, or is the idea that Liberal Democracy as a system will inevitably just become blindly complacent, and get covertly overthrown by authoritarianism just something for movie plots?","Maybe the French second republic.

146,"I don't recall where I picked up the referral to Zeihan ""End of the World"", but I just finished a run of Fukuyama's works and feeling somewhat underwhelmed with Zeihan, both in style and substance. How do people view Zeihan in the geopolitical world? How strong is his academic research? 

It feels a little shock and awe and writing style is flippant. I haven't dug into it long enough to form an opinion, but I'm looking for books with depth and this doesn't feel like it. I want to discard it but need a reality check from the team here before I do.","Never heard of him, he's basically non-existent in academia. He's got pretty strong commercial cred, tho. Working under Friedman and getting to publish with him is a big deal. The big draw here is that this gives him a strong background in the US military and intelligence realm. 

I watched some of his YT videos, was a positive first impression. His analysis of current issues is timely and seems factual (Hard to say, after a couple of videos). Smart guy, likely has access to information and certainties that mere mortals don't have. Seems like he has been moving away from the commercial sector, positioning himself in the ""creator"" and speaker space, which would explain why he's writing pop-science. Imo that's not a great sign, since he is choosing to go into a direction that is harder to monetize, but has far less competition. I think someone with his background would have had more teeth, by being active in both realms, but it's hard to be trusted while being a public communicator. Ultimately, it really depends on his network, but his former collogues aren't the type to give things away for free.

His content was probably aimed at military folks and other people who got to look behind the curtain, but aren't active anymore. Those people don't care much for careful consideration, like academia. He's casting a much wider net now. I can't know his motivations, he could have a genuine interest in informing people, but it's also a very relaxed position that would remain stable for a long time, without having to put in much work. Cynics would call it a retirement plan.  

If you already have a good selection of sources and you are willing to put in the effort, there are more direct ways and you probably won't be getting massive insights beyond military info, here. If you don't, I'd say he makes for a good gateway drug bc he's big picture and easy to understand. He's def US-centric, but I don't see much of an indication that he's a disinformation. Hard to gauge the accuracy, but in terms of depth, his career path is the next best thing is being inside of the Pentagon and much less problematic, legally. Just don't treat him as a crystal ball, no analyst is. For example, he's pretty clearly lacking on the economic side of things. One reason to keep an eye on him, the quality of his sources will change dramatically with his influence."
147,I've been chit chatting with some of my close minded friends about the Alberta Sovereignty Act. They keep saying it's unconstitutional but doesn't say why. What part of it is unconstitutional?,"I just did brief research on it, but the law potentially sets up a situation where Alberta refuses to abide by a valid federal law.

In federal systems, the key is a clear division of power between the federal government and anything within it. In this case, the Canadian federal government and the provincial governments. This Alberta law vaguely grants powers to the province to ignore a law that might damage its economy (for example) even if the federal law is perfectly within its scope to pass."
148,"From what I understand, Sinema switched to Independent to avoid being primaried as her approval rating is pretty dismal. How will her switch to Independent work to her advantage in 2024?","It won’t.

For one, everyone saying this will “split the vote” has to remember that she can’t just hop on the ballot in Arizona as an independent. She would first need 42,000 signatures from independent voters, meaning they can’t be registered Democrat or Republican and that would be REALLY hard to get done without efficient campaign infrastructure that she doesn’t currently have without the Dems. And it would put a huge dent in whatever campaign funds she’ll have on hand. It’s moot anyways. 

She knows that she has no chances of winning Arizona as an independent or democrat. She’s doing this because she wants to be the center of attention and have the media discussing if she’s going to run or not while she heads to a nice corporate job after her term expires."

150,"Hi everyone,

I love political topics, but my interest sometimes harms my environment, because close people don't want to discuss political problems and news. i have motivation for learning new facts, researching, analyzing problems. 

So i would like to do some political commentary. Where should i start? I don't want to make podcasts for now. Any tips? 

Thank you","I just want to make sure we're on the same page here; political commentary is not a full time job, it's a hobby. Or, I should say, it's only a full time job for a couple hundred people in the United States. I'm reminded of [this scene from Seinfeld where George is trying to decide on a new career and suggests becoming a baseball color man](https://youtu.be/2LCggmsCXk4?t=40). Basically, it's not impossible to make a career out of it, it's just nearly impossibly difficult. The only people who really succeed there are prominent former politicians or prominent journalists.

I do this as a hobbyist. If you're okay with this not being a career, like if you just want to do it for fun or because you think you're doing something good for your community, here was my path:

Unpaid campaign volunteer, unpaid campaign manager, paid campaign manager, volunteer writer for local political blog, volunteer on my party's central committee, higher profile campaign manager... that's when people started to notice me and local papers started reaching out for me for comments. I ended up co-hosting a podcast and later a Saturday morning radio show, both of which were still unpaid volunteer positions.

As a political consultant, I made barely enough money to pay my rent. As a commentator I have never made more than the occasional free lunch. That being said, I wouldn't change it for the world. I just want to make sure you know what it looks like."

152,"As I understand it, and as another redditor noted, the motor of history is class struggle. The popular belief (I think) is that Marx meant communism to be an inevitable conclusion to class struggle in capitalism. This turned out to false. 

Fukuyama is not dogmatic, so I don't think he means capitalism as we see it today is the end of history, but a capitalism that evolves along with government and politics to truly represent the needs of the people. That's my crude understanding anyway; I'm not a formal student of political science just an avid pretender. 

Please help me out.","The idea is liberal capitalist democracy is the form of government towards which all states will naturally converge.

This isn’t really the end for Fukuyama though. The last chapter of The End of History, “The Last Man” (and the title of his next book, “The End of History and The Last Man”) is a reference to Nietzsche’s [The Last Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man) a kind of anti-Ubermench who becomes afflicted with nihilism in a materially abundant technocratic society. He sees this “end of history” leading to a great spiritual restlessness and dissatisfaction.

Quite a lot of people have criticized Fukuyama since the 1990s. I think the strongest criticism is showing how capitalism in China and Russia did not lead inevitably towards democracy — perhaps it had the opposite affect, where too much of an emphasis on free market capitalism worked against democratic progress.

But Fukuyama has become much less neoconservative and much more socialist over the years. His conception of liberal democracy in his latest book, Liberalism and it’s Discontents, fits more with the worldview of Corbyn and Sanders than Friedman and Rumsfeld. 

I think a lot of the current leftist critiques of Fukuyama come from misunderstandings. Yes, capitalism perhaps led China and Russia away from Democracy, but I think most leftists would argue this has made them less stable countries, and they would be better served by being more democratic and more socialist (in Fukuyama’s terminology, more classically liberal and less neoliberal.)"
153,"It seems worldwide that the more a politician is thought of as a leader of the ""common people"" the more of an air of corruption or flouting rules and norms that often benefit themselves and actually grifting from the government/people happens. And the more the ""common people"" seem to love them and be willing to put themselves in harms way to protect that regime. Why is that?",Because populism distrusts mainstream. Its inherent in populist ideology that the status quo and its legitimate institutions are inherently illegitimate. Therefore a “corrupt” individual is simply acting out in an already corrupt regime or society.

Nevertheless, he is a giant of history, having significantly shaped the 20th century with his thinking. But I lack perspective on him, and want to approach him correctly.

155,"He describes how both Southern Italy and Greece developed a modern political system via full scale suffrage, but due to the abundance of clientelism, neither have achieved what could be considered a genuine democracy.

As I understand it, the lower classes have basically been hijacked through clientelistic policies which benefit them in the short term but essentially gut their self interests long-term. I think this is what he is referring to with Modernization Without Development. I'm hoping someone here with a more articulate understanding could set me straight. Thank you.","Hey! It has been a few years since reading Political Order and Political Decay, but I will attempt a response surrounding what he is describing.  

When Fukuyama discusses the formation of the modern state, he is describing the move from tribal-level societies to formation of state and evolution from Patrimonial State to Modern States. In the development of the Modern State the concept of National Development is employed. This encompasses three pillars, per say, that can occur by themselves but shouldn’t for the optimal development to occur: Economic Growth, Social Mobilization, and Political Development. Fukuyama measures historical economic growth based on the industrialization of a society. With industrialization, there should be an increase in entrepreneurship, income, and industrial output. These increases ideally increase Social Mobilization, or the participation in a joint interest of ideology. Within Political Development there are three additional subgroups: State Building, Rule of Law, and Accountability. All of which develop individually over time. Roughly, his theory states that economic growth increases social mobilization, leading to more political participation. To restrict the state from suffering from political decay, there also needs to be Political Development in the subgroup areas that coincides with increases in either economic growth or social mobilization.

Italy developed its current multi-party parliamentary republic after the ‘fall of fascism’. In the implementation of this electoral system, there was an immediate increase in social mobilization of the population. This is the “Modernization” of the political structure. Now focusing on Southern Italy and clientelism: there was increase in the economic investment by the state. The goal of the state was to utilize the modernized political system to industrialize the economy via the disbursement of state funds based on the needs of the localities articulated by the elected officials who now represent the population. Intended Goal: Political Development -> Social Mobilization -> Economic Growth -> Political development, etc. a positive feedback loop. However, due to clientelism and patronage, personal interests and personal relationships were prioritized over the will of the population participating in the political system, and all the benefits of economic growth and social mobilization were restricted by the lack of political development in the areas of accountability and rule of law.  Southern Italy experienced economic growth, without the positive increases in income, entrepreneurship, or economic output. Southern Italy saw increased social mobilization through participation in elections and representation at a national level without increasing the participation in a joint interest of ideology. Southern Italy modernized its political and economic system, but did not develop the political structures necessary for optional National Development, thus, Southern Italy experienced “Modernization Without Development”.

156,Many Democratic Congresspeople claimed that they were deeply distressed at having to force the RR unions to accept a less-than-satisfactory negotiation. But Dems still have a bare majority in both houses of Congress until Christmas. Is this a decision that would have required a supermajority? Or did they figure that Sinemanchin wouldn't vote for it? It seems to me that Dems could have enforced the union side rather than the corporate side of the disagreement.,"Virtually every piece of legislation requires 60 votes to get through the Senate (with a few exceptions for reconciliation bills, which wouldn't apply here).

Because Congress has the authority under the Railway Labor Act to enforce an agreement, once Biden signed the legislation into law, it becomes binding. Workers can indeed still strike if they wanted to, but it would then be considered illegal, and the railway companies would quickly get the courts to enforce the law. As the article notes, unions could face major fines if they went ahead with a strike, and workers could lose their jobs.

The article also notes that this is similar to the air traffic controller strike in the 1980s, when Reagan fired all striking controllers and barred them from ever coming back. Once a strike becomes illegal, workers and unions can pay a serious price if they go ahead with a strike anyway."

160,"It  seems to be that multiculturalism is popular in the US, Canada and in  western Europe. In the rest of the world it seems it's not that popular.  Is there a reason for this?

I'm also curious why it's not popular in all of Europe but seems mostly a western european thing.","There are four aspects concerning this subject I'd like to highlight:

The first aspect is that 'they' (certain migrant groups) are here (western Europe), because we were there (Asia, Africa, the Americas) in colonial times. As a consequence of colonial empires, people from there migrated to the specific mother country that ruled these areas. That can be because of certain citizenship rights, the relevant language skills, or just previous family contacts. You can see which places were ruled by which mother country by looking at the origins of the (larger) migrant groups. The colonial experience overseas also sets west European countries apart from east European countries, who lack this history.

The second aspect is labour migration. After World War II western Europeans needed a lot of labour for reconstruction and economic growth. At first they looked to southern European countries for labour migration, later to elsewhere in the world. These people were often invited, but not necessarily expected to stay for the longer term. People from the second or third generation sometimes found themselves to be second class citizens in a country they were born in.

The third aspect is that multiculturalism was/is not always seen as positive, yet the experience of World War II and memory of the crimes of the Nazis made any criticism of foreign immigration rather taboo. From the 1980s onward however right-wing populists have mobilised nativism in the native population and heavily criticized 'political correctness' on the subject of multiculturalism. So popularity is not a given.

The last aspect is that east European countries had a lot of multiculturalism up to World War I in various multinational empires. But their main lessons of WW I and II has been that  mononational/monocultural nation-states are necessary to avoid war, as any ethnic minority within your borders could lead to aggression from a neighbouring state. Ethnic cleansing and deportations during and after the world wars led to suddenly very homogeneous populations in these countries afterwards. The experiences of Communist dictatorships also caused people to treasure their national identity and monoculture, although there was some migration within the Communist bloc, for example with Vietnamese moving to Czechoslovakia. 

I hope this explains some of the differences in stances towards multiculturalism in (very) broad strokes."

The Constitution is very light on the specific rules for how the House operates--who has committee appointments, what committees there are, when debate is opened, when debate is closed, when votes happen, etc. This is a good thing in many ways, but ultimately the Constitution delegates these rules to the Speaker to create and enforce. And when Newt Gingrich was the Speaker, he enacted a bunch of rules changes that essentially gives the Speaker almost total control over those sorts of things.

This means that ""winning the House"" matters because what the House does is determined almost entirely by the Speaker. The Speaker is elected by a majority vote of all members of the House, so especially since the days of Gingrich, the party that wins the majority almost always has their most obvious leader become speaker, and that party then controls a lot of what happens in the House.

So why is this time different? Well, the Reps undershot expectations by quite a bit. The Reps by their own benchmarks needed a red wave to have a successful election season, and they most definitely did not have that. This means two things: 1) there are some folks looking for heads to roll after such a poor performance, and 2) the Reps need almost every vote they have to put *anybody* in speakership over Dem objection so the room for error is very small.

McCarthy was the clear leader of House Reps before the drastically bad election, so some folks are attempting to blame him. The interesting thing from this is that the clearest losers in the Reps were the MAGA-est parts of the party, and most of Trump's key supporters in the House such as MTG or Jim Jordan are backing McCarthy. It's mostly the Freedom Caucus that is pushing back against his speakership...and boosting one of their own.

Essentially, it appears that some folks who want to take a greater role in the party smell blood in the water and are hoping to pounce on McCarthy's weakness. Right now, after leading the party to such a shockingly bad election, McCarthy is probably at his weakest, and if anyone else has designs to elevate themselves to a position of party leadership in the House, now would be a decent time to do it. Ultimately, this all may be a bit overblown--it's not all that clear that McCarthy will fail to win and in the end the Reps don't really have an obvious candidate to take over. But this is just more evidence that the election didn't really go the way the Reps were hoping and that their leadership is struggling a bit to lead effectively."
163,"In theory if the Republicans are divided, a Democrat could end up being voted in as speaker, correct? Even with the Republicans having a majority of House seats. Has that ever happened before? And if it were to happen, could the Republicans take back the speakership at any time (assuming they finally decide on someone they can all support)?","They vote again and again and again until a majority of *everyone* agrees. It's non-partisan in actuality. Also they can vote simply 'present' instead of for a candidate, and it's included in the vote totals. So attendance is important. There is precedent. There was a session a hundred years ago where it was months and many, many rounds of voting before the whole House agreed in majority, regardless of party. I don't have the resources, but this is well defined. And, there were articles discussing the scope of it after the 2016 election when the leading candidate then as now faced the prospect of a slim majority."

What realities do cities like London and Paris have as a consequence of their universal centrality, realities that the US avoids?","Although I haven't done any research, I suspect that in the centuries of early capitalism it was much more common for companies to be based in their country's capital city.

Companies are larger and more powerful than the usual shops and merchants of the medieval period, which brings them into greater contact with the government (as a client, regulator or rival). When jockeying for power alongside the monarchy, the aristocracy and other capitalists, it would've made sense to simply set up your headquarters as near the palace or parliament as possible. When time is money, you can't afford to spend days getting from Lancaster to London by carriage every time you need royal approval for a new trading colony.

The concern with transportation to the capital is probably only outdone by the concern of transportation to where your buyers are. Ignoring the fact that it was the American capital for a brief moment in history, New York famously became a trade and financial hub because of its location relative to the Hudson River. Amsterdam likely prospered because of its river access. As transportation became easier and more ambitious in the 19th and 20th, commerce became less fixated around the capitals and more fixated around the ports and waterways (case in point: the Strait of Hormuz)."

166,"Why have Palestine's neighboring Arab countries not offered more support to Palestinian refugees? Why were Palestinian refugees unable to assimilate into neighboring Arab countries?

Granted, my question is somewhat strange, but it is coming from a place of good faith as I am trying to understand this problem in regards to Israel-Palestine and the refugee crisis. My question is this: how much refugee support has been extended from neighboring countries to the Palestinians? Why weren't they able to provide more support for these refugees so that so many of them don't have to live under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and in an open-air prison like Gaza? Are these countries politically motivated in keeping Palestinians in a state of refuge as international leverage against Israel? 

Further, why haven't these neighboring countries offered the route of assimilation or citizenship to palestinian refugees? I know that palestinian identity is rooted in a rejection of Israel, and so I cannot understand why, after Israeli occupation of Palestine, assimilation into neighboring countries for the Palestinians wasn't a solution. Is it because Arab countries purposely stopped assimilation, or because the rising Arab-Israeli tensions meant that after the 1948 and 1967 wars, the people of Palestine were unwilling to leave until they have an established state? Or is it a combination of factors of rising Arab-Israeli tensions and unwillingness of the Palestinian people to leave their identity behind and assimilate, political motivations on the part of neighboring Arab countries? Looking for a detailed answer :)","Couple of reasons. I'm going to be a bit broad because otherwise it's a book and I don't write books for free. I do also want to look at the issue in terms of realpolitik - I am an ardent supporter of Palestine and I'm deeply disgusted with the actions of the state of Israel but the world of politics operates more on practical realities than on what's morally right more often than it doesn't.

For starters, Palestinian refugees just aren't these states' problem. The issue is being created by Israel's expulsionist policies so many of these states don't see why they should have to clean up after Israel and serve Israeli interests by giving Palestinians a place to go. Israel *wants* Palestinians to leave. Laying out the welcome mat is helping Israel do that.

These states figure why should they *help* Israel do something that *they* then have to pay for? Especially when their relationship with Israel isn't exactly cooperative to begin with.

Furthermore, refugees are expensive to help. Especially when you're talking about tens of thousands of them, they need a lot of things and those things have to come from somewhere. Lebanon is suffering from crushing economic problems, Egypt has had a series of political blow-ups and isn't exactly swimming in cash, Jordan is in better(ish) shape but their economy isn't massive and they're also dealing with an influx of refugees from Syria and the ongoing conflict there. Syria is in the middle of a civil war, not exactly in a position to help.

Cyprus is an option (if you could get past the blockades) but they're not exactly booming either. Also, as I understand it, they're not the most welcoming place for refugees.

So it's not like there's a wide range of options for places to go if someone were to want to flee the country.

That's kinda the long and the short of it. There's this perception that Palestinians have places to go if they wanted to when they actually really don't. Even if they could get into somewhere that wasn't immediately on the border, most regional powers are not up to offering the kind of support that a large influx of refugees would require. Saudi Arabia *maybe* but they're not eager to take on a large population of refugees that don't really have anything to offer economically and will need a lot of support for some time to come."

Fast forward to yesterday and again, it took 4 days after Election Day to count votes there. Literally almost every other state does not have that issue.","> Literally almost every other state does not have that issue.

Well, to begin with, that isn't true. There are lots of other states that have this issue--California, for example, which has the most voters by far, can sometimes take weeks to count. Alaska builds in extra time after election day to make sure absentee ballots can travel long distances. But their state-wide elections are rarely competitive enough that those races can't be called early. Nevada's problem is that it's a competitive state.

[This article](https://archive.ph/Ty13U) goes deeper into Nevada-specific problems, but the short answer is that Nevada accepts mail-in ballots for several days after the election, as long as they were postmarked by election day. During the pandemic, the state changed their laws to require mail-in ballots sent to every registered voter. This has meant a big rise in mail-in ballots to be processed, without necessarily an increase in the ability to process those ballots."

176,Bank of Canada recently said unemployment rate was too low and bad for the economy. Can someone please explain why the economy needs the unemployed to exist?,"Pretend you want to start a business. Obviously if you want to grow it, you need to hire other people. If there are no unemployed people, then your only option to hire is to ""take/steal"" an employee from someone else. In order to do so, you offer that employee more money than they were currently making (for example, if they were making $15/hour, you offer them $17/hour). Once that employee leaves, that employer is in the same boat and must steal a different employee. So the low unemployment has two significant impacts from this perspective; that there aren't enough employees to grow your economy, and wages will have to rise quickly as employees jump from business to business. 

Generally, a national unemployment rate of ~4-5% is great. When it drops below 4%, you start having issues finding workers, meaning the economy can't grow as quickly as it wants."
177,"As of the moment I write this, the projection for house elections is between 220-215 D and 220-215 R, a two seat majority either way.

The only similar situation was in 1931 (post-Hoover midterm), when a bunch of Republican reps died and Democrats won special elections to take control. This all happened, however, BEFORE the session officially started in December, so Dems chose the Speaker for the full session.

In the Senate, neither party leader is a Constitutional position, and they are more or less on equal footing, so switching from one to the other is a relatively informal process, minus potential committee reorganization. The Speaker, however, IS a Constitutional position, with greater power and responsibilities under a much more rigid set of rules and many more people to control.

Note that most districts are equal population already, as that's fairly easy to enforce, and you can still have a lot of distortions even with equal population.

Generally, most fixes are about adjusting who decides the redistricting.  As there's lots of subtle ways to influence a result; so you want the deciding group to be one less interested in partisan concerns.

They have a liveblog going on, and unlike most media coverage of the night, 538 does a good job avoiding partisan hot takes and other really stupid takes. They've already talked a bit about some this question.

But overall, the concept of certain races being ""turning points"" in the night is a bit overblown. The bottom line is that one race going well doesn't mean another will or won't. Just look at 2020, where the Dems had some weird underperformances in the Senate races in Maine and North Carolina, some right on like in Arizona, and some odd overperformances like in Georgia.

Looking at close races is actually not even a very good way to answer this question. For example, in PA and GA we've got races that could go either way. This means that just a very slight underperformance for either side could result in a widely different outcome, and such minor variations may not actually signal much. But also, because we're at 50/50 in the Senate, you could see the night mostly go according to plan for both sides and still see a major shift in the status quo.

In a lot of ways, the best way to answer this question is to look at the margin and measure the under or overperformance there. For example, on the 538 chat they've noticed that there is a 7 point gap between Warnock and Abrams, despite both sharing the same ballots, which is entirely consistent with the polling. Similarly, they're closely watching the abortion ballot measure in KY.

But if you're just looking for a very simple ""what is the best indicator of who will control the Senate or House?"" then you should try and see which races have the closest margins and see if they go the way they are ""supposed"" to. Looking up the 538 election forecast would give you enough to determine that on your own, and obviously if the two closest Senate races (PA and GA) are determined early...then that's probably a pretty good indicator.

The 17th amendment to the Constitution (passed 1912) says:

>When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.

So the Constitution says vacancies in the Senate are filled by the ""executive"" (AKA governor) until the state holds elections. Elections are very expensive, so it would cost tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions) of dollars to hold an election just for one seat. So most states just wait until the next planned election to vote for that vacancy. So for your examples on Senators:

**Kamala Harris** was up for re-election in 2022. The governor of California chose Alex Padilla to serve the remainder of her term (January 2021- January 2023) and let the people vote in the next general election.

**John McCain** was elected in 2016. He died in August 2018. Due to how close this was to the general election in November 2018, The governor appointed Jon Kyl to the seat to fill until the next reasonable general election in November 2020. Jon Kyl resigned in December 2018, so Martha McSally was appointed to replace her until the general election of 2020, where she lost to Mark Kelly who will serve through 2022 when John McCain's seat originally expired.

Now for the House of Representatives, the Constitution says replacement MUST be elected, so nobody can appoint temporary replacements. So it's really up to the state to determine whether they want to spend the money/time to hold a special election for 1 seat, or wait for the next general election. In this case, Florida decided to hold the primaries for the seat with the general election in 2021, then the general election 2 months later in January."
195,"In other words, do the number of Republicans or Democrats elected to government positions nationally influence the party's political influence at the Federal level?","The answer here is nuanced. Of course state level stuff does factor into the national policy positions. Folks often get it backwards, but party platforms are determined based on what voters want to see. It's very hard for politicians to get voters to care about something they don't want to care about. It's very easy for voters to get politicians to care about something they didn't care about before. And obviously this grassroots perspective has go from voter->local organization->state organization->national organization.

But is it formulaic? Of course not. There's no mathematical equation here that perfectly explains how much influence is there. Some state level politicians are only state level politicians because frankly they're not talented enough to be more than that. Those folks may not always be able to have as much influence as someone else. But also the most talented state level folks tend to move up to federal office.

In short, broadly, yes, of course, lower level party folks do contribute to the national platform. A national candidate cannot afford to disregard the state level stuff happening, certainly. But is there a clearly precise amount this can be measured? Not really."
196,"I think the constitution is silent on secession.  Yet its widely  assumed to be “settled law.”  But is it specified in the constitution?  And section 8 says to “provide and maintain a Navy.”  But when it comes to the Army, it says appropriations will be for no more than 2 years.  So maybe they were afraid of a standing army and wanted it to dismiss it, and then the military is just a militia?","In Roe v. Wade, a national right to abortion was established through a specific legal concept called substantive due process. This is the legal concept that was discussed and rejected for abortion in Dobbs. It would be reasonable for someone to apply the Dobbs precedent to other substantive due process rights, yes, but it would not really make sense to apply that precedent to anything else.

You're basically oversimplifying. It wasn't that abortion was overturned because it's not in the Constitution. It's overturned because the Court rejected the premises of substantive due process which protects rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. 

So no, you could not use Dobbs to justify secession, but you could use it to justify taking away federal protections on interracial marriage, for example."

198,"In the SF Bay Area school boards are using ""equity"" as the basis for cancelling advanced math programs and cancelling test-in admissions policies. Might this ruling reach beyond colleges' admissions policies?","Probably not.

First of all, in CA, affirmative action is already illegal (for public schools). So nothing happening in the Bay Area has anything to do with affirmative action.

If this was not in CA, then still no.

Canceling a test-based admissions program and replacing it with a lottery (as happened at Lowell) eliminates all forms of discrimination (positive, negative, or otherwise) from admissions. A test-based admissions system intentionally discriminates on the basis of test scores; that's what it is designed to do.

It might be easier to make an argument about a budget decision favoring one group over another (that's what canceling advanced math is. It's a decision to fund some other program instead), but the politics of that would look really bad (you would have to argue that advanced math courses inherently benefit white and Asian students), and implementing a ruling like that would be impossible. Every budget ever made favors some group over another. If anything that incidentally benefits one racial group can be budgeted for, nothing can be budgeted for."
199,Can someone act as press secretary and chief of staff of the US at the same time?,"Is it constitutionally / legally possible?

Functionally is it possible?

Probably not. In major offices, like the White House or big Senate offices, they're both full-time jobs (arguably both actually requiring more time than the average full-time job). And have some overlapping but ultimately pretty different skill sets.

That being said, yes sometimes in smaller offices or teams - you'll have the Chief of Staff double-hatting in another capacity (though unlikely the Press Secretary - while the Press Secretary is often the most visible member of the communications teams, it's actually usually the Communications Director in most offices that is the most senior comms staff - though obviously again, in very small teams, it's often the same person)"

203,"Currently most states (all except Nebraska and Maine) use a ""general ticket"" or ""winner takes all"" form of voting in regards to the Electoral College.

(In theory at least, I know there could unfaithful electors, but that's not especially relevant to my interest.)

I'm aware that it would require a constitutional amendment to abolish the electoral college entirely, but could Congress pass a law abolishing the practice of ""general ticket"" voting by states?  

I'm asking more in theoretical sense of whether this would be legally possible, less of whether there is the political will to do actually do so at present.

> Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress[.]

While there is debate over the extent of the ""Legislature,"" the text seems to make clear that it is up to each state to decide how to allocate electors and that the federal government has no power whatsoever to change that.

205,"For example, could the president veto ambiguously? Like not directly sending a bill back to the congressional clerk’s office but instead tweeting out something critical of the bill within 10 days of it passing and then not signing it. Or another example could be the president claiming they informed a member of congressional leadership on a phone call that they disapproved of the bill, but never put it in writing?

Or on the flip side could congress create a requirement so onerous that a veto is effectively difficult, or impossible, to do? For example, by requiring that they be informed of the veto by the president showing up, in person, to deliver a 24 hour speech explaining their reasons for opposing the bill","To start, let's see what the Constitution says about vetoes. Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution:

>Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.

So when a bill is passed by Congress, the President has 10 days to veto the bill. If the President signs (or doesn't sign) the bill, it becomes law. The exception is if Congress goes on recess within the 10 days, so the President can't return the bill vetoed. This is called a ""pocket veto"" where the President doesn't sign the bill, but because Congress isn't present to receive a veto the bill fails to become law.

So looking at your scenarios:

>Like not directly sending a bill back to the congressional clerk’s office but instead tweeting out something critical of the bill within 10 days of it passing and then not signing it.

If Congress is in session during those 10 days, the bill becomes law unless the President explicitly ""returns it with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated"". So tweeting out something critical would likely fail to count as returning the bill to the Chamber of Congress in question. The DoJ under Trump has repeatedly argued that Presidential tweets are not taken as orders because they are not direct enough, so it's unlikely the government would change that stance.

>Or another example could be the president claiming they informed a member of congressional leadership on a phone call that they disapproved of the bill, but never put it in writing?

You're starting to get into grey territory, but courts would likely err on the side of tradition, and say failure to return the bill to the House in a physical form (as has always been done) would fail to meet the spirit of the Constitution and wouldn't count as a veto.

>Or on the flip side could congress create a requirement so onerous that a veto is effectively difficult, or impossible, to do? For example, by requiring that they be informed of the veto by the president showing up, in person, to deliver a 24 hour speech explaining their reasons for opposing the bill

So this is starting to get into a grey area, because courts generally don't get into political questions (known as the ""political doctrine"", where courts won't rule on issues that are very political like ""checks and balances"" questions). But if Congress attempted to stymie Presidential powers through excessive legislation, there's a good chance SCOTUS would rule with the President. Courts generally don't like one branch trying to railroad or strip powers from another branch when it's explicitly laid out in the Constitution."
206,"In the Battle of Kasham, we (I'm American) called the Russians ahead of time to ensure that the Russian mercenaries weren't ""part of Russia"", right? So that we wouldn't kill/fire upon direct Russian forces? What I want to know is, why did Russia just let hundreds of them die? I understand that publicly they keep the stance that the Wagner Group isn't part of their forces, but is that public perception more important than the mercenaries actually surviving? Can someone explain the geopolitics here more clearly?","The mercenaries were part of a group that had been firing on Americans located in an agreed upon deconfliction zone. 

We have things like deconfliction zones so Russians and Americans don’t accidentally start firing at each other, creating an international incident between nuclear powers. We agree to stay in our zones and Russia agrees to stay in their zones.

So if official Russian forces were firing upon an American deconfliction zone, that could be seen as an act of war."
207,"Like, suppose that the U.S. House of Representatives got increased from 435 seats up to 735, and these 735 seats were apportioned among the states in the same way that the existing 435 currently are. So Maryland, for example, which currently has 8 seats, would have 13 or 14 instead.

Would the increased number of districts make it easier or harder for a party in power to gerrymander a state?","It would be much harder. One reason that gerrymandering is so effective is that instead of just creating new districts when the population demands it, we ""reshuffle"" districts which involves moving around voters to different districts. If we just added districts as needed based on population growth, there's much less wholesale redrawing of lines and more marginal shifts as states grow and shrink. 

We might see some initial gerrymandering the first time we move from 8 seats to 13 or 14, but even then, it's a lot harder to get creative with the borders when your districts are smaller. If you've got fewer folks you're representing, it's harder to draw really confusing or complicated lines that are still somewhat compact."

The electoral systems in vast majority of the US make it extremely difficult for minor parties or independents to succeed therefore the default is that the 2 current major parties are the only viable options.

230,"With the British succession the relationship of Britain to the Commonwealth has been in the news lately, along with much speculation that many countries will leave the Commonwealth.

As a Civilization player the history here is very confusing to me.  A nation takes over a fair portion of the world, fights like lions and even commit atrocities to keep it, wins two world wars, then one day shortly thereafter just.. stops fighting and lets the empire fall apart?  That doesn't make much sense.

I'm happy they're not repressing people any more.  And in the case of my own country (the US) it doesn't make any sense to try to reunify with Britain because.. well, we split up a long time ago, and it was a bad breakup.

For the Commonwealth countries.. Well if I lived in a country that never had a bad breakup with Britain, in fact was still in the Commonwealth which I guess means they're nominally ""still together""...

And today, the actual systems of government and society of Great Britain are relatively free and modern, plus Britain has a strong economy (London is a big financial center), a big army, a lot of worldwide cultural and diplomatic influence...

So for the Commonwealth countries, wouldn't it make sense to remain together?  If anything, I'd think they'd be pushing to become even be more entangled with Britain, maybe turn the Commonwealth into something like the EU?  If I lived in, say, one of the African Commonwealth members, I'd certainly be willing to pay taxes and give away some autonomy in exchange for all the problems that might be solved by that big army, strong economy, relatively stable political system, and diplomatic / cultural influence.

Plus Britain just broke up with the EU and is now single :)","Post WWII there was simply no appetite for the fighting that would have been necessary to maintain their empire. Most of their African possessions were rebelling, or on the edge of it, and India was clearly ready to break into full fledged rebellion any day. They were broke, two generations of men had died in the last two world wars, and no one wanted to keep fighting."
231,Is there evidence that economic ties with Russia were part of European security system? Maybe it has roots in Congress of Vienna and still held up after WW2? Or was it mentioned in Helsinki Accords? I just tried to find some facts that prove this decision being deliberate and not just something like an afterthought of purely economic (cheaper gas and oil) reasons.,"I heard this from a European expert but can't find the article so take my word with a grain of salt.

Western Europe post-war, after some time passed, had a mindset that the lesson of WWII is they need to integrate. Both wars were started because nations believed in their individual supremacy and felt that entitled them to conquest. And so while there was certainly an economic component to things like the EEC and EU, a lot of the language used by people pushing it was that this would be the way to ensure none of our nations get in their head they should start another war. That the consequence for another war could be 1 in every 3 young people dead or disabled as had happened twice already. This was the pan-european ethos that began building up in the latter half of the cold war, a belief that war can be avoided with interconnectedness and believing in something larger than your individual nation. 

At the end of the cold war, those pan-European institutions began expanding eastward. They seemed to generally share these values and so nothing was openly challenging Western Europe's assumptions about the lessons from WWII. 

So the natural order would be continued integration with all of Europe, including Russia. After all, Europe made complex things Russians would buy in droves, and Russia had vast raw resources greater than anything Western Europe had within their borders. More than half of all Russian imports came from Europe and more than half of all Russian exports went to Europe. So, thinking this was just an expansion of cooperation and integration, many nations developed with an assumption that they could always count on those raw resources from Russia.

But 2014 changed that calculus. They invaded, occupied and declared soverignty over Crimea and had a years long war in Eastern Ukraine. It changed some nations views regarding Russia, and many slowly started becoming less dependent on Russia. But the steak through the heart of the idea of peacefull integration of Russia came in Febuary.

Because that story of WWII that western Europe has is not the perspective Russia has on the Great Patriotic War. It wasn't a tale of nations believing conquest was justified. Russia started the war on the side of the Nazis, expanding eastward for the baltic states and part of Poland. But Russian history doesn't consider that part of the Great Patriotic War. That war didn't start until Germany betrayed Russia and attempted to invade. It wasn't a lesson about the folly of expansion, after all they got to keep what they expanded into. It was just a tail about Western Europe being threatened by Russian might. And so the solution is not a universal disarmament and cooperation, it's to say that Russia's authority shall not be challenged. 

So Western Europe thought integration with Russia *was* part of their security. And what they're realizing now is they aren't as similar as they thought they were."
232,"So Russians are currently occupying the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, right? And the plant provides up to nearly half of all energy in Ukraine? Why don't the Russian soldiers occupying it just force the Ukrainian operators of the plant to just shut it down and shut off power to the rest of Ukraine? What is the point of keeping it up and maintaining it?","[Targeting civilian infrastructure is a war crime](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule7_sectionc).

233,I haven't been able to get a straight answer on this. Where did this idea come from? If it's true shouldn't everything she says about the case not matter? How is there even a way a judge with no jurisdiction can do anything about the case?,"In order for Trump to have standing to request a special master, he must show the judge that the FBI’s search was improper.

Trump has said he can’t say if the search was improper until a special master is appointed.

Cannon has decided to appoint a special master for Trump, to help Trump possibly show the search was improper, giving Cannon the jurisdiction to appoint a special master.

It’s Möbius strip logic.

Normally to challenge a search *before a criminal trial* the impropriety must be facially obvious — like the search warrant listed someone else’s address.

Further, [44 U.S. Code § 2204 - Restrictions on access to Presidential records](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2204)

As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing honors and appointing the prime minister, which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is also able to advise, generally done in secret, to change draft laws. The monarch is also Head of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.

Nowadays it tends to mean something pretty specific as marketplaces and corporations have globalized and standardized. There's no real difference in a corporation created in Japan or Russia or America or Spain or wherever. Because sanctions are such a modern word with a relatively specific meaning, you're not really going to look back in history and see sanctions across human development. 

But if you adjust your question a little bit to understand that sanctions are merely the modern example of governments using economic opportunity as a tool with which to act towards other governments, then it become apparent that countries/governments have always used economic opportunity as a tool."

Outside of that though, Kissinger is worth reading because he is pretty much a primary source on historical USA-Chinese relations and thus has insight there.

242,"This is a very broad question and I am looking for recommendations for further reading more than for actual concrete answers (although those are more than welcome).

I don't have a very clear definition of what ""powerful"" means so that is another area where clarification is welcome.

Of course, these don't have to be direct, for example, if you can tell influential people what to do, you also have real power, even though you don't directly vote on bills in parliament.

250,"From 2002-2008, one of the most divisive issues in the country was whether American troops should be at war in Iraq, and whether such a military campaign was necessary or justified. At elite levels, the majority of congressional Democrats sided with the GOP in voting to go to war in Iraq, visibly alienating the more progressive elements of their base.

Widespread protests occurred in the U.S. and elsewhere, and music artists ranging from Incubus and Green Day to the Dixie Chicks (as they were then known) made waves with vocal opposition to George W. Bush and especially the Iraq War. Aaron MacGruder (the creator of the Boondocks) used up a lot of ink criticizing George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and the Iraq War in newspapers across the country. Anti-war sentiment was covered with some regularity in TIME and NPR. Entertainment media included works like *Team America: World Police* and *Fahrenheit 9/11* that heavily criticized the Iraq War and questioned the motivations behind it. Typical critics of American foreign policy such as Naom Chomsky had at least some time in the limelight talking about the moral implications of the Iraq War and its resemblance to the Vietnam War.

Despite the cultural impact of the Iraq-era peace movement, why is it not remembered as momentous as the Vietnam peace movement? It seems that it is largely forgotten about in cultural discourse in spite of having been the topic *du jour* on every politically active person's mind in the early 2000s.","It just wasn't as *big.*

It seems weird to say that about the largest anti-war protest in human history (Feb 2003) but the anti-Iraq War movement just wasn't as comprehensive and polarizing as the protests against the Vietnam War.

It's important to remember that violence was a much more consistent part of the anti-war movement with regards to Vietnam. Draft offices were raided and the paperwork in them destroyed or the offices themselves were blown up or burned down and you had protest groups bombing targets related to the war effort. During the war itself you had instances of ""fragging,"" or soldiers deliberately killing other soldiers or more often, commanding officers. There were around a thousand documented instances of this happening with many more suspected. 

Anti-war protests themselves were comparatively quite violent. Police weren't as well armed but firehoses, dogs, and batons were regular participants and protesters pretty regularly clashed with police in ways we didn't see again until you had the rise of more heavily militarized police in the US and incidents like the WTO protests in the 90's.

That simply does not have a correlate in the 2000's anti-war protest movement. It was, by and large, very civil and violence was abhorred by most of the larger participating organizing bodies. You didn't have people blowing up recruitment offices or killing their commanding officers out of anger and frustration.

It's also important to remember that the Iraq War enjoyed *a lot* more popular support at home than the Vietnam War eventually had. Even as the war dragged on, a lot of Americans still really weren't against the war, at least not in a way that might prompt them to blow up a building or throw a brick at a cop. People weren't being drafted and sent to Vietnam, they were voluntarily signing up to go to Iraq.

The casualties were vastly different as well. Something like 60,000 killed and 300,000 wounded in Vietnam vs 4,500 killed and 30,000 wounded in Iraq. That coupled with the overall tenor of the wars was wildly different.

We weren't *winning* in Iraq but we also weren't getting hundreds of kids being sent back in body bags every week with more being forced to go fight. We had casualties but it wasn't this never-ending drum beat of hundreds and hundreds, many of whom weren't going of their own free will. We weren't winning in Vietnam and it fueled frustration because it felt like we were feeding young men into the meat grinder for no reason. 

That psychological weight added a lot of fuel to the anti-war movement that just wasn't there for Iraq."

More over, how do political campaigns solicit funds from large donors too, such as companies etc? Do they just call the target donor and ask for a contribution? What would persuade a company like this to contribute funds to a politician who's just starting out their campaign, with no name brand recognition yet?","PACs solicit donors in almost the same way as candidates do. They have fundraisers, send texts and emails, send mail, and of course make phone calls (called 'dialing for dollars' in the industry). These tactics are the same for small and large donors alike.

For how they decide WHO to target, it's a little more difficult. They can do donor list swaps with friendly organizations, they can do cold contacts to voters whose profiles match their target supporters, or run ads online. Over the years they build their own lists of faithful donors to resolicit.

I also imagine each state theoretically has these procedures written in an election law statute somewhere, so check the state legislature pages for state laws.

I don't think it's wrong to say that ""fascist"" has become somewhat of an over-used insult or accusation but that doesn't change the fact that it does have an actual meaning.

If you wanted to *really* cut it down to the wiring of a definition of fascism, that's doable.

Fascism is a political ideology that revolves around the centralized power of the state as the embodiment of a national character, often represented by a single individual or small group, it heavily relies on an idealized/mythological a-historical that's pieced together specifically for the purpose of creating the idea of a single, unified national identity. There's a strong militaristic/law and order bent with a high degree of social militarization and adulation of the armed forces that also ties into a cult of heroism and action along with a glorification of violence for the sake of the state with an intense focus on internal/external ""enemies"" that threaten to destroy everything.

Fascism is *highly* syncretic and that broad framework can map onto almost any cultural context. You had Showa Nationalism in Japan, Falangism in Spain, Nazism in Germany, and Shirt movements in dozens of countries around the world. 

Anywhere you can mix ideas of intense nationalism, authoritarian state control, rejuvenating powers of violence, and a unified/idealized cultural/ethnic/historical identity you can end up with fascism.

There's the famous 14 characteristics of fascism as put forth by Umberto Eco and while these are helpful guides, people tend to treat these like a checklist - if it doesn't meet one of the criteria on the list exactly then it's not fascism. ""Ur-Fascism"" is still an excellent read even today but again, people tend to use Eco's thesis as a diagnostic tool rather than a prompt for inquiry.

259,"It passed the House on July 19 - seems like radio silence since then. Does it usually take so long for new developments to come out with a bill like this?

I found one source that says Schumer will bring the bill to the floor when it has 10 Republicans in favor. Can we take that to mean, since it’s been 5 weeks and nothing has happened, they weren’t able to find enough Republicans?

Is the Bill being blocked and left to die by Republicans like some predicted, or is it too soon to make that call?","After passing the Inflation Reduction Act, congress went to their home districts for a few weeks. They will come back after Labor Day but will leave to campaign sometime in late September or early October. 

So there's no progress in large part because everyone's back home (or using the time for vacation) and it's hard to get progress when no one is in DC actively negotiating and working through things.

It's too soon to call it dead. When Congress comes back they'll only have a few weeks of legislating before the election and we'll see what they do with it.

Edit: to add extra context, The US government uses October 1st as the ""new year"" for budgeting. That means there are still several departments that need funding or would shut down Oct 1st. This could be a quick ""delay it till after November"" or it could be dragged out because they can not have a single senate defector. Joe Manchin is wanting to put a permitting reform package in it, and a few progressives have complained. Permitting reform means quicker environmental studies and less chances to cancel a big project, so easier to build oil pipelines but also easier to build wind and solar farms. AOC has supported something like it since it makes green infrastructure much cheaper, so hopefully progressives don't make this a big deal. But if Democrats can hold together an not fight, there may be time to work on RMA in that period too. Otherwise it may be a struggle to keep the lights on before September ends."
260,"Starting with the premise that the US needs to develop more political parties throughout its levels of government, why don't smaller political parties invest their resources in local or state elections?  While it would certainly require taking the long view in strategy, winning some local or state elections seems like a great opportunity to grow a new organization.

If a minor political party focused on a single state or region, wouldn't it be a much better use of their resources to get their people elected there?  This would allow them to develop examples of their ideas and platform in work while also giving them a solid base from which to operate and develop new sources of press and funding.  If a party grew like this, they could potentially push for state level election changes such as ranked choice or proportional voting that could help break the two party system in the long run.

This idea seems obvious to me, but I know that there are much wiser political minds in the world who would have thought this up if it was a valid strategy.  What would be the problem with this approach?","A question I can answer! I'm a political consultant, and have had very lengthy talks with some of the libertarian state party leaders. I have suggested to them that they are putting the cart before the horse, and need to establish a strong base before building up to statewide races. I agree with you, but they respond with 2 major points:

1. In many states there is a threshold of 3-5%, that if a party reaches or exceeds in the top election on the ballot last cycle, they are given easier ballot access in the future. (eg. in Illinois, if you are in a Major Party(your party reached that threshold) you need 5000* petition signatures for statewide races and can start collecting in late fall, but if you are a New Party(you didn't reach that threshold) you will need 15,000 petition sigs and cannot begin collecting till mid-winter. *Dates and numbers may have changed slightly since I last looked it up.)

1. Top of the ticket races are sexier. They bring in donors, volunteers, and afford them easier access to earned media (free spots on tv and in other news media)

Between those two reasons, it becomes almost a necessity for third parties to run someone in the statewide race, and only then do their best to recruit lower level candidates. On that subject, recruiting candidates is hard. Like really hard. The major parties have an issue with it everywhere, and while a lot of that is due to old, rusty party infrastructure, that decline in an interest in being part of the party infrastructure is often due to not having enough local candidates, a vicious cycle. How much worse for those 3rd parties who have little or no infrastructure.

Tldr. Top ticket races are sexy and bring in the dough, recruiting candidates is hard af, and ballot access is given only to those who do well in those top races."
261,"Is it true that all of the aid from the US to Ukraine will need to be repaid? If yes, can they just return the materials? Is there a system to determine the value of antiquated weapons?","No. The equipment comes from many sources. The Lend Lease Act is a fiction: we are not getting or expecting to get back our weapons. I can’t find any loans in the acts. Even programs like foreign military financing through the state department, they’re buying long term equipment we’re giving them aid to buy. In the short term we’re transferring arms and paying to replace our own. 

Some of the money goes to our own farmers. The bills cover up to 2026. If you’ve noticed there actually has been zero hearing about Ukraine aid oversight. It’s all in multiple special speedy bills. There’s a lot of weird stuff in these bills as expected."
262,"Suppose you have a prime minister in one system and a president in the other. They both want a bunch of legislation to pass that gets whatever it is they want done. Whether the bills are good or bad is irrelevant to this scenario. The prime minister could have a majority government, minority government, coalition, confidence and supply, etc. It doesn't matter for this scenario. The same thing can be said for the president and the legislative branch. Given these facts, in one year, which system will be more productive? That is, in which system will there be more legislation signed into law which the government supports without any hesitation or reservation? These can't be bills which the government clearly didn't want but was forced to accept or watered down legislation that the government wished would go farther. They have got to be bills which the government was actively pushing for and was very insistent on passing.","In general, a parliamentary system would be more effective at enacting the executive branch's legislative agenda. In a parliamentary system the executive branch leads the legislative process based on the support it receives from the majority of its membership. If a prime minister doesn't enjoy the support of their legislature they usually don't get to remain in office. If the legislature can't select anyone to be prime minister it usually results in early elections.

In a presidential system the executive and legislative branch are more independent from each other. Using the US as an example you have a greater chance of a divergence of opinion between the executive and legislative branch then you would in a parliamentary system. The president, representatives, and senators are all elected at different times, for different term lengths. The president being elected every 4 years, Representatives being elected every two years, and senators serving 6-year terms staggered into two-year intervals between three senatorial classes.

In contrast in a parliamentary system the prime minister is chosen almost immediately after the parliament is elected. The odds of them differing on opinion is smaller. But it's not impossible.

Parliamentary systems can gridlock too under the right circumstances. Famously, this happened in Belgium about a few years ago. A parliament was elected that was too fragmented to choose a prime minister, but was unwilling to call an early election. The Belgian Parliament went 592 days without choosing a prime minister. That became a world record."
263,"I'm soon to dive into a number of his books, including World Order, On China, and Diplomacy. He rightfully takes a lot of heat for his role in the Vietnam War and subsequent SE Asian crises, including Cambodia. And certainly, he was invested in Nixon retaining power.

That said, from how I currently understand Kissinger and realpolitik, I cannot inherently blame his position. I don't see him as a paranoid power monger or ideologically extreme. So I want to here from folks here how would you describe him and his ideology?","You either like Machiavelli or hate him. So you either think that being *effective* at achieving your policy goals is more important than being moral, or you think this is a horrible idea and the ends never justify the ends.

264," This is a bit of a strange question, but I was going through one of those mandatory Title IX/Sexual Harassment online trainings for a new job, and on a few occasions, the training mentioned ""Rape and Sodomy"" this struck me as odd since as far as I knew, Sodomy stopped being a legal category after Lawrence v. Texas (and I'm in California which is a state that had decriminalized it before then). It also didn't seem like this was bias/backwardness on the trainer since they mentioned CA laws that extend title IX protections to sexual minorities.

So my question is, even though it is legal, is Sodomy still a legal category in some parts of the U.S, and if so, why? Also, why would it be included in this type of training?","Currently, sodomy is the name of a sex crime in some jurisdictions. This is distinct from the sex acts at issue in Lawrence because the act currently criminalized are non-consensual."
265,And which of those allowed such a change in the last Presidential Election?,"Presently none.  But the SCOTUS will take up. Case next session to address that.

266," It seems to me that ""single issue"" bills, such as extending the Child Tax Credit, or doing away with the ""Carried Interest"" loophole would be much more effective in getting bi-partisan support and forcing senators / congresspeople to go on record on a specific topic. Why don't we see more of them?","This is an area where voters don't really understand how legislating works. The result is everyone thinks passing a single issue bill makes a lot of sense, but if you actually understand how legislating works, then it really doesn't. And that results in voters thinking Congress sucks, when really they don't suck (for the reasons voters think they do at least). Let's get into it.

One factor here is that the single issues you're focusing on are not issues that do have broad support by both parties. The Reps don't want to extend the Child Tax Credit. Nor do they want to do away with the Carried Interest loophole. So you're starting at a position where there aren't enough votes do these things even if there is only one thing we're focusing on. 

So how do we get more people to vote for this thing? You're not going to convince the Reps to change their policy position. The only way that happens is if Rep voters force their representatives to change. But that's not happening.

So instead, you just make it worth their while to compromise. Instead of just passing the CTC, you pass a bill that extends the CTC but also does something the Reps want. They're going to ask for a few things, and then you suggest if the Reps want all those things, then the Dems have a few things they want to do on those issues as well, and if we're negotiating compromise, we might as well negotiate compromise. Pretty soon, this bill that was originally designed to address a single issue has turned into an omnibus bill because you need multiple facets involved to get different things to compromise back and forth on.

We do see bills that have bipartisan appeal pass more easily without being big omnibus bills. For example, look at the recent gun control bill passed by Biden. That was a bill that had broad support across the parties and it passed without bundling in a bunch of other stuff."
267,First Nancy Pelosi went to Taiwan and now the US is opening trade talks. Why antagonize China now? Doesn’t the US have enough on its hands with Russia and Ukraine?,"Trade talks are a form of dialogue with China to get back to some kind of normal so that’s not really ‘messing’ with China.

Pelosi visited Taiwan for roughly 12 hours in-between trips elsewhere. She isn’t the first nor the last Congressmember to do that. That’s Congress’ right. China chose to overreact in that case and throw a fit for no apparent reason. So, again, not really messing with anyone. Probably the greater question is why China is messing with Taiwan - there should be greater priorities."
268,"For example Michigan governor Whitmer has declared a state of emergency due to burst water pipes. and thousands being without water.

Does there exist such a website or tool?","Probably not because such a tool would be waaaaay too huge to maintain. The President technically appoints a huge number of appointees, not just the highest level guys, so this would quickly become really impossible to keep up to date. Also most of those appointments are not really a political/partisan activity, so it's not really clear how useful such a tool would be.

All of the major appointees are something you can just look up. Maybe if you think this tool would be really useful, you can create it yourself."
270,"I know, it's never been done (that I know of) but since the players are passed on, I'll used this example: Gerald Ford Pardoned Nixon for unspecified crimes. Could Carter or Clinton have legally rescinded it? (doubtful if Reagan or Bush would have)","Yes. It has happened a few times before in US history. I believe Clinton reversed one of his own pardons after receiving more info about someone he pardoned. I know Andrew Johnson had some of his pardons reversed by Ulysses S. Grant - but that's suspect because the pardons issued were never received. 

They can also be reversed if the president has been impeached (not removed, but impeached). That is to protect the rule of law and ensure a president cannot pardon their partners in crime to which they are a part of.

Remember a pardon is required if there is guilt. An admission of guilt or conviction is required for a pardon to be issued...(that's the one that gets me)."
271,"I always hear the news about bills that were voted and approved in the House, but never made to the Senate.

Is there a time limit for the Senate to pick up these bills which were already voted in the past? What is the process?","A bill that is not enacted in a 2 year Congress dies when that Congress adjourns. It can be reintroduced with a new bill number though.

The issue is that the composition of the house changes 100% every 2 years, creating a “new” Congress, whereas the Senate changes 1/3 every 2 years, so you lose the votes that said yes/no when that Congress adjourns, necessitating a new vote in both houses.

For our purposes, that happens after the midterms (2023 change of Congress)"
272,"In Israel, the Tel Aviv metropolitan area is represented by two teams/organizations in association football and basketball: Hapoel Tel Aviv and Maccabi Tel Aviv. Hapoel (Hebrew for “the worker”) has historically had a much more left-wing Labor Zionist following, as evidenced by its red and white uniforms that feature a hammer and sickle. Maccabi (named for the ancient Maccabee warriors) meanwhile has a more right-wing and Religious Zionist following, as evidenced by its blue uniforms that feature a Star of David.

There aren’t really any obviously political divisions like this in American sports that I know of, and yet there are still cities that are represented by multiple teams in various sports (namely New York and Los Angeles). Are Giants fans and Jets fans divided along political lines? What about Dodgers fans and Angels fans? Or Cubs fans and White Sox fans?","When it comes to teams in the same city/region, you often do see slight differences in fanbase demographics, mainly due to location. For example, the Oakland A's are stereotypically a more ""blue collar"" and racially diverse fanbase compared to the SF Giants. Similar story for the Sox and Cubs. That being said, these divisions are typically driven by location and really more stereotypes than hard facts.

That being said, teams generally avoid outright political alignment, outside of generic pro-Americanism. You might get teams with outspoken owners, players, or a general culture of leaning a certain way, but nothing official."

You should always register as the party whose primary you want to vote in, unless you live in an open primary state. There's no rule, legally or informally, that says you have to vote for your affiliated party in the general election. 

I always say ""I'm X at heart, but Y on paper"", because I'm signed up for the majority party in my state even though I have opposite beliefs. This is because the same party always gets elected, so the primary is more important than the general election here.

In some states the number of registered voters for a third party affect their presence on the ballot... but they don't have much of a chance unless you have ranked choice voting, anyway."

Would this still count?","There is no cut-and-dry answer to this question because it is political in nature. NATO article 5 is non-binding, so each member state can make up their own mind about whether they would defend Poland if Polish territory gets attacked as a result of them joining the war in Ukraine. 

Realistically, before Poland joined the war in Ukraine, they would discuss this with the other NATO member states and they would try to come up with a coherent strategy. No one can tell you what that strategy would like because it is entirely dependent on who is in power in the member states and what the current situation in Ukraine is."

Melanchon got 20% of the vote in the last presidential election and 69 seats in the National Assembly. The French Communist Party hasn't gotten numbers close to that since the 70s.

279,"For example, if tomorrow, Russia started trading with China for tanks, and Russia was embargoed today, what's stopping Russia and China from trading if they can do it over land?","Nothing, physically. Which is also a theme I think you'll come to notice quite a lot once you start looking into political relationships. Both international and domestic. Most groups and nations can do a lot of things. However, the big but here is that other people can have a reaction to the thing that the first group/nation did.

In this case, yes, China could physically ship train load after train load of tanks into Russia. Physically, China could send an army into Ukraine via Russia and invade the nation alongside Russia. No one could stop that directly.

But the world can and would respond. China is attempting to become a super power. To do that, it needs soft power even more than hard power. The world's nation's will largely recoil if China becomes more actively involved on the side of Russia. Chinese economic deals will be canceled. Opinions of China will plummet. Cultural ties will be severed. Chinese soft power will be smacked around pretty badly, just as it's being built up. 

Then they also risk a more targeted response. Western sanctions could stab a deep hole into the Chinese economy. Their finance system in particular was build to join the western system, so the quick and brutal removal of the Chinese finance system from the broader world it was designed for would be very bad for it. 

And so far, China hasn't been willing to provoke these reactions.

A lot of the same people who say Palestine shouldn't be part of Israel (border changes from 1940's - 1960's ought to be undone) also say that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is illegitimate (border changes from the 1990's should stay).

If conquest claims are legitimate, much of Europe should be in the control of either Germany (WW1 / WW2), France (Napoleon), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Empire#/media/File:Swedish_Empire.svg) (1600's), Italy (Roman Empire) or Greece (Alexander the Great).

288,"Usually when I see the term ""indigenous peoples"" it's in reference to First Nations, Aboriginal Australians, and African peoples. But as a sort of identity people use in the public sphere, I'm confused over who can use the term.

My family is Greek, would that mean I'm an indigenous person in my home country? Or does it, in modern parlance, only refer to non-white populations outside of Europe? Everyone is indigenous somewhere, so does the context of the conversation matter? For example, can it be used when talking about Native American history or politics, and then also in regards to European history dealing with imperialism/colonialism in the Balkans by the Ottoman Empire? I don't want to cause offence if I refer myself as indigenous in some contexts.","There is no formal, official definition of indigenous, although individual countries or jurisdictions might have them.

[However, here is a very common definition from the United Nations.](https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf)

>Considering the diversity of indigenous peoples, an official definition of “indigenous” has not been adopted by any UN-system body. Instead the system has developed a modern understanding of this term based on the following  
>  
>•  Self- identification as indigenous peoples at the individual level and accepted by the community as their member.    
>  
>•  Historical continuity with pre-colonial  and/or pre-settler societies   
>  
>•  Strong link to territories and surrounding natural resources   
>  
>•  Distinct social, economic or political systems   
>  
>•  Distinct language, culture and beliefs   
>  
>•  Form non-dominant groups of society    
>  
>•  Resolve to maintain and reproduce their ancestral environments and systems as distinctive peoples and communities. 

There are two main points here that prevent everyone (or no one) from being considered. A group has to largely self-identify as indigenous and form a non-dominant group within a given society.  So Greeks are not indigenous, despite meeting most of these criteria, since they 1)Don't identify as indigenous and 2)Are the dominant group in Greece. 

This also means a group could be indigenous and one point in history and cease to be indigenous when their political situation changes."

Whilst in the UK that would be able to happen immediately based on how we count our votes in an election, in the US it seems like it's mechanically impossible to ever change without some astonishingly deep reforms that feels eternally unlikely to happen.","I’m not sure the idea of a “coalition government” even makes sense in American politics. The United States doesn’t form “governments” at each election like Parlamentary systems do.

As I understand it, parlamentary legislators are usually voted for by party, the party then chooses what actual human to stick in the seats they’ve won, and that human is then usually bound to vote in accordance with that party’s policies. Then you need a majority (either one party majority or a coalition) to agree to work together to appoint all the Ministers (including Prime) that form the actual Execitive that does stuff. 

In the U.S., the parties don’t technically exist, every legislator is elected as an individual, and thus they can (and do) “break ranks” and vote against their party whenever they feel like it.

And the Executive is voted separately, so no majority is required in the legislature. The Senate is supposed to confirm all the Secretaries that run the individual departments, but somebody as always “Acting Secretary of Whatever” (and generally taking orders explicitly from the President) until the Senate get around to confirming the President’s nominees. No majority among parties is required to get these guys confirmed though, even with no majority you just have to convince enough individual  Senators to vote for each guy (and it doesn’t have to be the same Senators in each case). So the President usually just finds someone who appeals to enough individual Senators, or there are behind the scenes deals to pass legislation particular Senators want in exchange for voting in the guys the President nominates.

If somehow a third party gained a significant presence in our congress, not having a majority in the two legislative houses would create some weird procedural issues since right now we assume there is a “Majority Leader” and “Minority Leader”, and committees and such are supposed to have members of “both” parties, but the Constitution doesn’t recognize the parties anyway so they would work it out somehow. Again, you just need to get a majority of individual legislators (not parties) to vote in each change that needs to be made, and voting together on one issue does not in any way create the expectation that you will always vote with that “coalition” on other issues. So everything would just move through eventually, in small pieces, with different and ever-shifting “coalitions” making deals with each other. There would never be a formal agreement to form a “government” and always vote together on everything.

The Vice President used to be the runner up of the Presidential election, but we amended that hundreds of years ago and now it’s technically a separate election, but in practice the same party that wins the presidency is also going to win the vice-presidency. The VP’s only real power is breaking tie votes in the Senate, anything else they do is just whatever the President feels like delegating to them.

As for changing our system, I think most of my fellow Americans erroneously think the 2-party system is how it is supposed to be. At best, they are resigned to thinking it can never be changed. Even among those of us that would like to change it, I don’t think we all agree that going to a proportional system is the way to go. So there is no real movement toward proportional , or anything else, right now."
292,"I'm curious to know because I've been told that it is not as simple as one may believe to get enrolled in ""welfare."" 

My first question: ""welfare"" actually describes a bunch of different programs right? Who administers these programs, and what are they? I'm assuming Medicaid, Food Stamps, and housing/rental vouchers are all part of ""welfare""? Is SSI and Medicare also technically considered ""welfare""? Or does welfare have a specific definition?

The simple argument is that ""welfare is easy to get on so why would someone want to get off? Therefore we need to make it difficult to enroll and a crappy program."" I consider myself a logical guy, so my gut reaction is the program isn't exactly a panacea of benefits, and that participants, particularly for financial benefits have to prove they qualify, and this also includes job hunting to show they aren't sucking on the teet of the government, so to speak. Please help me understand. Thanks.","A lot depends on the state you live in. Different states have different rules. More on that in a moment.

Welfare consists of various programs. TANF or SSI. TANF is Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. SSI is Supplemental Security Income and is for long term disablity for those that don't have enough credits in their Social Security account. A good example is my oldest grandson. He's been drawing SSI for most of his life. He was diagnosed with epilepsy about the age of 12. Even if he could find work that he could do, he'd be limited as most employers don't want a worker than can suddenly have a seizure. He won't even get the option of working in a sheltered workshop because his mother won't untie the apron strings. These people are often on the program for life. It's not easy.

TANF, OTOH, is a welfare program that is set up as a stopgap: breadwinner unable to work due to an temporary illness or injury. Usually a low income family to begin with. It also is a program that many single parents (usually mothers) end up on. If they have a pre-school child, they are not forced to get a job. Benefits for this are based on the household income. In Indiana, the maximum accountable income for a family of three is $596 a month. Being a red state, it's geared towards single mothers.  At one time, the only  way a household with a male adult would qualify is if he was disabled. (temp or permanent) THEN HE has to prove his inability to work. (medical records, etc) 

So this most commonly pointed at segment of welfare pretty much excludes about half the population.

Medicaid. Yes, it is a welfare program. Amazingly enough, I DO qualify for that as I am over 60 and disabled. If you are on TANF, the odds that your minor children are also covered by this to one extent or another. Likewise, if you are pregnant. I only s. (note: Red States have the most stringent requirements) Example: I receive $1,557 a month in disalability payments. (I had enough credits when I became disabled in 2008 to qualify for SSD - which is NOT a welfare program) Because ""I make too much"" I do not qualify for SNAP. (Thank goodness the food banks don't have such stringent rules. More on that later)

Medicaid. Yes, it is a welfare program. Amazingly enough, I DO qualify for that as I am over 60 and disabled. If you are on TANF, the odds that your minor children are also covered by this to one extent or another. Likewise, if you are pregnant. I only qualified for it about 5 years ago, just after my 60th birthday. It's not always easy. As I qualify for Medicare, I also have an insurance plan through Anthem that is really great. (sorry, only available for disabled seniors that have Medicaid and Medicare. Indiana did a great thing by ousting Mike Pence)   


The ""easiest"" program to get on would be SNAP. For that, you have to have a low income per household size. Earned income vs household expenditures. (Or unearned income, like TANF or SSI) 

Other programs that fall under the ""welfare title"" would be Subsidized housing. Note: even that had a limit. A married couple can get it if only ONE of them works, but if the second is employed, they lose it. (at least here in Indiana)

Why aren't they ""sucking at the teet"" of the government? Because what you receive from those programs are bare existence living. I worked hard and had a lot of low paying jobs because I lacked the networking skills and contacts to get better jobs. Much of my working life, I worked jobs I could get, and usually qualified for food stamps because of my family size. (Note: when my wife was pregnant with our son, we applied and, SHAZAM, I made $10 a month too much. Living in a Red State) 

I make a LOT more than a lot of the people I know that draw Social Security benefits: retirement or disability. My ex, who became disabled a decade before me, never accumulated enough credits (even though I warned her back in our 20s) and drew SSI for most of that time period. The kicker: since I was working, her disbursement would fluctuate based on MY income.  Her base income on that, at the time, was about $525/month. If I put in a lot of OT, her payment went down. The first 5 months I was disabled (before getting my first disability payment) She got the max payment. Our SNAP payment went up while our rent went down. As soon as I got my first disability payment, her SSI was dropped because ""I made too much money."" 

Sound like I'm bleeding the government? I worked decades, hard work, both physically and mentally, until I couldn't work any more. 

Things I've been able to enjoy by the sweat of my labor? Color TVs. Cable TV and Internet, a roof over my head, food in my belly (The 90s saw my only good paying jobs) things that make life worth living.

Pensions? I took a buy out on the one that wasn't gutted when I had the opportunity because I no longer trust corporate America. I could have invested it, but, when I qualified for Medicaid, I was only allowed to have a total of $3K in assets. No 401K, monthly pension would have been counted against me, etc. 

One thing that HAS helped and been effective are the pilot programs of the Universal Basic Income. So far, the only place in the US that tried it was Oakland, CA, and they were quite successful with it. Recipients received $500 a month, no strings attached. The money didn't go to drugs and alcohol as the conservatives stated, but to those frivolities of utility payments, clothes or food, the basics in life. They didn't say, ""F\*\*\* this, I don't need to work for a living!"" No, they invested in their households. I won't say they didn't buy ANY luxury items: I'm sure the kids had a great Christmas. Who benefited? The recipients, Oakland Businesses, employers. Ya see, when your not stressed out about paying rent or electric, your body feels better and you don't call in sick (or as often) and you employer benefits as well.

That's why when I see a progressive point to the UBI as being good, it's because Trickle down didn't work. Lower taxes for the rich stayed with the rich. Raise their taxes to cover it, they'll still benefit, just not as obscenely as they have.

So when you hear people say welfare makes people lazy and become drains on society, the chances are they are the ones that are projecting."
293,"Most US Presidents have used the Executive Order to bulldog their initiatives through or weaken other initiatives their predecessors created that they don't agree with. For example, President Joe Biden recently issued an Executive Order protecting access to reproductive rights. Donald Trump used an Executive Order to weaken Obamacare.

296,"I’m referring to the bill which provides healthcare for veterans exposed to burn pits.

297,"US has been sanctioning Cuba for decades.  There was a brief break during the Obama presidency, but Trump reinstated the sanctions.  I don't really think I understand even the basic history:

- What was the original reason for the sanctions?
- Why did Obama lift them?
- Why did Trump reinstate them?
- Why is Biden letting them stand?

Then I'm not sure, yes Cuba's kind of evil, but what makes Cuba so special?  We do business with other countries that do evil things, why do we turn the screws on Cuba so much?

- If we sanction Cuba because it's communist, why don't we do the same with other communist countries like China?
- If we sanction Cuba because it doesn't respect human rights, why don't we do the same with other human rights abusing countries like Saudi Arabia?

AFAIK when the US imposes sanctions, it doesn't say ""We're going to turn the screws on your economy because we hate you.""  Instead it says ""We're going to turn the screws on your economy because you did X, and we'll continue to do so unless you do Y.""  The sanctions aren't a spiteful act just done to hurt people, they're a stick intended to get a country to stop doing something bad.  The country only suffers the consequences if they continue to do the bad thing, and they can make the sanctions go away at any time by reversing course.

My question is:  What is X and Y for Cuba?  Has the US government publicly said what things it wants Cuba to do to get the sanctions lifted?

If the government of Cuba hypothetically said ""We want to get those sanctions lifted and we're willing to do whatever it takes,"" what exactly would the US ask Cuba to do?  Admissions of past wrongdoings?  Cuba apologizing for almost starting WW3 by allowing the Soviets to put missiles in the 1960's?  Renouncing communism, reversing communist policies and embracing capitalism instead?  Dismantling prisons for political prisoners?  Agreeing to be annexed as a US territory?  Paying money to the US?  Denouncing formerly Communist Russia, currently Communist China, or other countries?  Pulling out of specific international treaties / agreements?  Putting officials of the Castro government on trial for specific things?  How does the Guantanamo naval base and terrorism detention center fit into all this?

A long time ago, I read a rumor on the Internet that Cuba was responsible for assassinating JFK.  But I thought the JFK assassination is still an unsolved mystery.  Are the sanctions US blame / punishment to Cuba for assassinating JFK?  How is the response to assassinating a President mere sanctions and not a full-on invasion from the US military?  Are they thinking that it's a mystery, there are 10 suspects, Cuba's one of the suspects so they're 10% guilty, therefore we do sanctions which are 10% as bad as invading?",">What was the original reason for the sanctions?  


When we imposed sanctions on Cuba, the United States was following a policy called containment. The goal was to isolate Communist countries from the rest of the world as possible. We did have some trade relations with Communist countries, but not many, so the sanctions were not so hypocritical. 

Cuba was also especially important to the United States. Of course, Cuba is very close to the US, so it was considered a great threat than China or Angola (other countries with Communist revolutions). (And to be fair, Cuba did host nuclear weapons pointing directly at the u.s for a little while) Cuba was also part of the U.S. sphere of influence. The U.S. basically viewed Cuba as a colony; it fought a war for Cuba's independence and expected loyalty. The U.S. needed to show a strong response to the Cuban Revolution so as not to look like it couldn't defend it's own sphere of influence.

>Why did Obama lift them?  


Obama basically believed they weren't working, and so maintaining them seemed ridiculous. The Obama administration probably also believed that connecting Cuba to the broader world would ultimately lead to democratization. 

>Why did Trump reinstate them?

Because Trump had courted a small but influential group of hard-line Cuban-Americans, who fled the Cuban regime and perceive any thaw in Cuban-American relations as legitimizing the authoritarian regime that they, rightly, view as oppressive. 

>Why is Biden letting them stand?

According to the Cuban Democracy Act, the sanctions are supposed to remain in place until Cuba commits to ""democratization and greater respect for human rights."" Since Trump rescinded most of Obama's Cuban policies, the Cuban regime has backtracked on democratic and economic openings and become more repressive and restrictive. This is the official reason that Biden is not returning to the Cuban Thaw (and of course, Biden just has other priorities, inflation, the pandemic, Iran, Russia).

Of course, if you are the Cuban government, you are going to say, ""We promised you democratization in exchange for sanctions relief. You broke your part of the deal. Why should we honor it)

>f the government of Cuba hypothetically said ""We want to get those sanctions lifted and we're willing to do whatever it takes,"" what exactly would the US ask Cuba to do? 

Market-based economic reforms (mostly opening the country for trade and privatization) and multi-party elections. Probably also some agreement to honor the U.S. lease of Guantanamo Bay which the Cuban government currently considers illegitimate. 

>Then I'm not sure, yes Cuba's kind of evil, but what makes Cuba so special? We do business with other countries that do evil things, why do we turn the screws on Cuba so much?

Unlike China, Cuba is a small country that is isolated from the world economy. Economic sanctions on Cuba do not hurt U.S. consumers. Unlike Saudi Arabia, Cuba is not a U.S. ally, and it isn't an important part of American foreign policy in the region. 

>A long time ago, I read a rumor on the Internet that Cuba was responsible for assassinating JFK. But I thought the JFK assassination is still an unsolved mystery.

Officially speaking, the JFK assassination is not unsolved. A lone wolf gunman assassinated him. That's what the government says, at least, so demanding Cuba pay reparations for that would reveal a lot of previously hidden information. It would have been the largest government cover-up possibly in human history and would have massive implications across the board. The Biden Admin actually recently prevented the automatic declassification of documents related to the JFK assassination."
298,"This is something I have noticed frequently.

Left-leaning people on Reddit are always complaining about how the admins are right-biased and anti-left wing. Yet right people are always going on about how the moderation team is super leftist and is actively silencing right-leaning voices.

Same on YouTube, according to left wing YouTubers, the YouTube staff is super right-wing and demonetizes all left-leaning videos but according to right wing youtubers, it’s actually super left-wing and demonetizes all right-leaning videos.

Left-wingers claim that Facebook apparently got Trump elected and their staff is full of right wingers and Right wingers claim that Facebook got Biden elected and is full of left wingers.

What makes people think like this ?","People have a tendency to view themselves as the center, even when they're not.

When you compound this tendency with being inside an echo chamber where the only opinions are those of people just like them, they tend to view anything that contradicts their vision of the center as being 'biased'.

With that in mind, those on the left are far more likely to misjudge the center than those on the right. Conservatives routinely interact with the liberal portions of the nation, while the reverse is not true. Virtually all entertainment media is presented from a liberal point of view and the tech industry is heavily slanted towards the extreme left.

Young people also tend to be far more likely to misjudge bias due to the fact that they have limited life experience - most particularly, limited life experience having to bear responsibility for others."

I understand why ISIS would be opposed to groups like, say, Hezbollah (because they are Shia) or the Houthis (because they support Yemeni nationalism as opposed to pan-Islamic nationalism). But why do they dislike al-Qaeda, or Boko Haram, or even the Taliban? Is it over personal grudges or actual issues of substance?","ISI started out as the Al-Qaeda affiliate in Iraq. When the Syrian Civil War was beginning, ISI sent some of its people into Syria to fight the Syrian Government and to help start up a new Al-Qaeda affiliate there - what eventually became Jabhat Al-Nusra. From 2013 - 2014, ISI took over territory in eastern Syria and western Iraq, and declared themselves the  Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. They requested that Jabhat Al-Nusra be absorbed into their own forces, which was opposed by both Jabhat Al-Nusra and the leadership of Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda disowned ISIS, while several former Al-Qaeda affiliates and independent Islamist groups (such as Boko Haram) pledged their loyalty to ISIS."

2. Views on economics. Left for regulated (planned to complex taxing), right for free (less to no tax). Proven false considering libertarian and fascism is on the same, though fascists like government controlled economy for the state
3. Cultural. Left for progressivism, right for conservatism aka saving the tradition. Proven false as libertarians and fascists don't share the views on culture I guess
4. Origins. The left for overall changes, the right for reactionism, just like in the FBR.

317,I saw he visited MBS today and fist bumped him also but I thought he was going to hold them responsible and make them a global pariah?,"A few reasons:

1. To try to convince Saudi Arabia to increase oil production (to help lower global oil and gas prices).

2. To establish a relationship with a leader (MBS) for a country which whom the US has strained relations, but who is still a strategic security partner in the region.

3. To encourage normalization between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Israel, which might eventually lead to participation in the regional air defense cooperation and generally better economic and diplomatic relations with the United States' closest ally in the Middle East.

There are likely other considerations as well, including the rising threats of China and Russia, the war in Yemen, boxing in Iran, etc.

I'm not arguing that the trip necessarily secured any of those goals or was smart to undertake (and I am certainly not defending the fist bump, which has been a public relations coup for MBS), but those are some of the underlying reasons for the trip. In short: geopolitical and domestic priorities seem to have trumped the moral repugnancy with which Biden views MBS."
318,"Putin is forcefully bringing a bunch of Ukrainians into Russia.  They need to be guarded to ensure they don't escape or start setting Russia on fire with sabotage.

The families of dead soldiers are also being watched now.  Given how many dead soldiers there are, that's a lot of people who need watching.

The oligarchs are being squeezed by sanctions, and they have money so they could be a threat -- they also need to be watched.

Plus the usual opposition, aspiring successors within his own circle, and ordinary street protestors / would-be reformers.

Oh and some people in his own intelligence services may also try to take Putin out, *somebody* in the intelligence services has to have access to un-diddled information about how bad things are, and realize that Putin needs to go for the greater good of Russia, and Putin being Putin, there's only one way that will happen.  Or simply be paid to take him out by one of said aspiring successors.

If you get more watchers, don't you also need more watchers watching the watchers in some kind of exponential positive feedback loop?

Given all the people who need to be watched, how does Putin find enough loyal people to watch them all, especially given how corrupt and incompetent the Russian rank-and-file is?","An inconvenient true for many anti-Russia people is that Putin is actually well-liked in the country.

After the fall of the USSR people like Yeltsin committed a coup, attacked parliament with tanks, destroyed the entire economy, etc. The ordinary Russians see Putin as the guy that put a stop to these things.

Yes, this entire 'fight' between the west and Russia has caused an economic decline for the Russian people. But they are still better off then 15 years ago. That's what we also forget: After everything that has happened, the quality of life for the average Russian has gone up.

One thing you can always look at is the average life expectancy! Right before the collapse of the USSR it was nearly 70, then it got lower to 65 and under Putin it went back to 73 years. For the US, for comparison, it has stagnated. 

So yeah, to sum it up: Putin has a lot of support. And people who don't like Putin, like the opposition in Russia, hate Putin less then they hate the idea of having a western puppet as their ruler. They oppose Putin but they don't want to throw the country into a civil war."
319,"A majority of Americans support access to abortion. Many studies have been done and they all show that the largest part of the electorate does - in some way - support access to abortion.

The GOP has never changed it's stance on abortion. It's clinging on to banning it, even for rape or incest. This is something very unpopular with moderate voters, which might cost them the midterms this year and will come back to haunt them every election.

So, why didn't they become more moderate on the issue? Why haven't they sought a middle way and for example went for shortened periods than the viability line, something that most voters would be able to accept?

In other words, why are they choosing the hard route on this and risk losing elections over this?","Abortion access is popular at the national level, but american politics doesn't work like that. In red states, restricting abortion is very popular. In blue states, it isn't. There are more blue voters than red voters, but local representation is very important (more states are red, although they have less people).

Additionally, people often overestimate how much support there is for abortion. Since something like 90% of all abortions happen in the first few weeks, one could answer ""Abortion should be legal in most cases"" and yet support banning abortion after 10 weeks -- those two are not contradictory at all. Very, very few people support third trimester elective abortions.

Another factor is how much people care for a given issue. Even if 60% of people in a given state were pro choice and only 40% pro life, it could still be more electorally viable to be pro life if those 40% are hardcore evangelicals who care about abortion above all else while those 60% care more about maintaining a low inflation or unemployment rate. There are levels of support beyond what your preference is (i.e.how much you prefer it)."
320,"This is something I've noticed since Trump started running for office, where other presidents are referred to by their name eg Barack Obama or simply Obama, Trump is almost always referred to as Mr Trump or President Trump.  This seems to hold true in both print and on TV.  Was this cleaver marketing, why is Trump refereed to differently than every other president?","I don't know that this is true beyond observational bias.

All former presidents are referred to as ""President"" but that's a convention that's diminished somewhat in the age of mass media. 

It might be deference in the sense that Trump trades heavily on his last name and he has a known pattern of [disliking being referred to by his first name.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/06/16/it-seems-that-donald-trump-doesnt-really-like-being-called-the-donald/) One of the ""strategies"" that Clinton employed during the 2016 debates was to constantly refer to him by his first name as a way to irritate him and make him lash out.

I think it also depends on *where* you're reading/hearing it. An outlet that's a little more pro-Trump (or caters to a pro-Trump audience) is likely going to lean more into the ""President Trump"" versus an outlet with a less positive outlook on him might be more inclined to use ""Mr."" to drive home the fact that he lost the 2020 election and is no longer the president."
321,"It seems like most people accept that the UK is a constitutional monarchy that operates according to democratic principles, and even one where the monarch is theoretically the head of the Church of England. 

I have seen it suggested that a caliph is more of a combination of the roles of emperor and pope than just one or the other. But I'm no expert on Islamic history, law, or political philosophy.

So I'm wondering if the idea of a caliphate is compatible with constitutionalism and/or with sharing power with a democratically elected government.","In past centuries, the position of the Caliph has acted as a ceremonial figurehead, much like the Queen of England does today. Historically, Caliphs were also chosen through a process of communal consultation, which is democratic in nature.

The real challenge comes from Islam being a core piece of a caliphate. Technically, while the Queen is the head of the Church of England and the Church of England is enmeshed in English tradition and government (e.g. the Church has representation within the House of Lords), English society at large is not technically bound by any laws or decrees of the Church. (We could argue that, indirectly or de facto, English society is greatly influenced by the morals and teachings of the Church since the two evolved together and shaped the kingdom into modern society, etc...)

In short, it doesn't take that much imagination to envision a Caliphate ruled by a ceremonial figurehead that is closely associated with the Islamic religion in terms of societal traditions and culture, but that is -- like England -- more or less a full democracy. The Islamism, the Caliph, etc. would be trappings of an otherwise modern society governed by democratic norms and a constitution."
322,"As the (USA relevant) question says...  If Social Security were to die/end or ""run out of money"" what would be the most likely cause of that happening?","Social Security is funded from a trust fund that your taxes pay into. It's estimated the surplus of this fund will run out in a few decades. Worst case scenario, if no proactive steps are taken, the surplus will disappear and benefits will have to be paid only out of current tax revenue. Which is estimated to be enough to pay at least 70% of benefits.

However, I think it is important to note that Social Security is a program of the Federal government, and as such, can always be funded, either through taxation or deficit spending. As Alan Greenspan, former Fed Reserve Chair, put it when asked by Paul Ryan about the long-term solvency of SS (I'm paraphrasing a bit here): there is no solvency issue, in that there is nothing to prevent the government from spending new money and issuing it to something. That question is, how do you build an economy that ensures that the real resources - housing, food, etc - are there which those benefits are meant to employ.

Put another way, the Federal Government as a whole can never be one insolvent. It can never be forced to default on its debt; it can always spend more, and it can always issue more debt in the process, as we have seen very clearly with recent events. But if we are not producing enough real resources - enough gas, enough housing, enough bread and butter - then people will be unable to buy those things regardless of whether or not the government sends them a check. This could be thanks to local supply shortages - if what they want is simply not available to be purchased - or, more realistically, it could simply be in the form of increased inflation, where they can't buy as much as they used to/as much as they expected to be able to.

Social Security is a policy choice to allot real resources to our seniors through the fiscal system. We tax some people so they can buy less, and give money to seniors so they can buy more. The government can always do this as much as the want. The real question, again, is how do we make sure that we have enough of the things everybody needs to live happy and productive lives? It is real resources which are scarce in this world; from the government's perspective, the money is the last thing it needs to worry about having, because it CREATES the money. The money is merely a tool for allocating limited real resources."
323,"If you look at a diagram of US military bases around the world, there doesn't seem to be military bases on South America, as shown here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American\_bases\_worldwide.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_bases_worldwide.svg). Why is that the case? What are the historical factors accounting for this if true? Or, am I interpreting the picture wrong, or is the graph a wrong representation of the situation?","Beyond panama U.S mostly had no strategic interest in South America until the Cold War era & the Socialist scare. U.S had entire countries with Dictatorships/ military control aligned & willing to mobilize militarily against perceived threats to U.S interest. Operation condor history shows how they trained/ advised directed & operated clandestinely in region. The Panama base is the Southern command of the Military, the regional base.

324,"Does Ukraine have to wait until the conflict with Russia is finished before being allowed to join NATO? If not, does the current war act as preexisting condition such that other member nations are not required to immediately declare war on Russia?","The rules in NATO basically state that in order for a country to be accepted it cannot have disputed borders or in armed open conflict. 

These rules are specifically there to prevent escalation and drawing the alliance into conflicts. NATO is a peace organization meant to prevent escalation of war.... not to be apart of it or a contributor."
325,"Liberals want federal abortion access, while conservatives believe such values-based policies should be made at a more local level (by the states).

Hypothetically, if such political power were further decentralized and brought closer to individual communities at the county level (which is what conservatives argue for, but to a greater degree), then liberal counties would legalize abortion and conservative ones would restrict it.

This would also make it easier for women across the US, even in red states, to access abortion by simply going to a neighbouring county (if theirs is conservative), which is what liberals argue for (just to a lesser extent).

But how feasible is this? I don't think the constitution says anything about whether or not counties have power over this, so could the Democrats (with the presidency, house, and a 50/50 senate) somehow federally declare that each county is free to restrict or broaden abortion access and that no state can enforce that decision across all its counties?","US conservatives might argue for local control in theory, but their political class do not abide by this principle in practice. A good example of this would be Florida's conservative state government suing the federal government for establishing regulation on mask use but then establishing state-level bans on local governments setting their own policy on the issue.

US conservatives argue that this is a state issue because they want their state-level governments to be able to ban it, not because they have some abstract interest in allowing more freedom for more polities and smaller to decide."
326,"Obviously, this is a word I use often, but I can't say I have a refined and polished list of criteria as to what makes someone a dictator. What features would you throw out there?","A dictator is somebody whose political survival depends on the support of a relatively small fraction of the population.  With some dictators such as Kim Jong Un, we're talking about less than 1% of the population.  Xi Jinping's survival in power depends on the support of the Communist Party elite.

For comparison, a democratic leader is somebody who needs the support of a broad section of the population to survive in power.  Emmanuel Macron won the last French election with 18,768,639 votes, which is about 36% of France's adult population.

Dictators tend to survive longer in power that democratic leaders provide they survive the first few risky years of consolidation."
327,"Asking because I came across this [Op-Ed](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-05-23/roe-abortion-equal-rights-amendment) arguing that the ERA would be the basis for making abortion recognized as a right at the federal level:

> Finalizing the ERA is the clearest path forward for abortion rights...ERA opponents frequently decry its enormous potential to protect reproductive rights and freedom. They’re not wrong. New Mexico’s state Supreme Court struck down a law (akin to the federal Hyde Amendment) that prohibited government-funded coverage of abortion, basing its ruling on the state’s ERA. Other states have had similar successes under their state-level ERAs — a good sign for future abortion litigation on the federal level with the ERA in place.

...And that passing the ERA is a trivial matter:

>We are literally one signature away from changing the Constitution. Though two years have passed since Virginia’s ratification, the archivist has refused to act, saying a green light is needed from the White House.

But on the other hand, if such a clear, actionable, viable path to safeguarding abortion was available, I would think I'd be hearing more discussion about it (among pundits, lawmakers, etc.). But the discourse I'm following all seems to agree that democrats have very limited options.

Also, whereas the above op-ed depicts the passage of the ERA as more-or-less a matter of Biden saying ""do it,"" the only reference I can find regarding Biden and the ERA is this [statement of support from January](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/27/statement-from-president-biden-on-the-equal-rights-amendment/), calling on congress to act. 

Is passage of the ERA a viable pathway to instituting the right to abortion on the federal level? And what are the barriers to passing it?","Let's start with ERA. While you'll find no shortage of people attempting to claim it's been ratified, the Courts aren't likely to support that interpretation since it requires you to effectively ignore the text that was ratified. That's the real reason Biden hasn't said ""do it"" (and why no President will).

Even if it did somehow come back, it wouldn't actually do anything. The ERA provides no additional protection beyond what the Equal Protection Clause does. Despite what some proponents argue, it does not force the Courts to apply strict scrutiny to sex-related issues. It just repeats the language used in the Equal Protection Clause. Remember, it was written back in the 1920s before the concept of differing levels of scrutiny even existed. It should come as no shock that it's been rendered obsolete by subsequent jurisprudence.

Now, the existing Equal Protection Clause has been argued as a basis for a 'right to abortion', but the federal courts have never really supported this notion. Nor does it seem likely they will in the near future.

Ultimately, when you look at the 'will of the people', there's a clear majority that supports abortion laws more restrictive than those permitted under Roe v. Wade or Casey. As long as that is the case - and it doesn't show any signs of changing any time soon - the 'right to abortion' is almost certainly dead and buried. Instead, you'll have either the states or the federal government legislatively creating rules about what abortions are legal and what are not."
328,"After looking a bit online, I couldn't find any discussion on the idea of creating an *elective* socialized healthcare system in the US. By this, I mean a system where those who want socialized healthcare may 'opt in' and pay taxes in order to receive the benefits of socialized healthcare, and those who don't want it may 'opt out' and be free from such taxes but also have to rely on the free market for healthcare. 

Basically, the government would cover healthcare for anyone who wants it and is willing to pay taxes, and everyone else would use independent healthcare.

In my mind, this seems like an option worth considering, since it essentially satisfies the desires of those for *and* against socialized medicine. Is this an idea that is being considered or that other countries have?","Yes, this is an idea in the political discourse.

329,A mainstream media network that a professor or university would stand behind for example? I know all networks have their bias but is there one that is trusted in a general consensus?,"It sounds like you're focusing on a TV network, and no, there aren't any that are worth your time. It's not usually a matter of bias that makes them so bad--CNN isn't really all that biased. The real issue with TV news is that it is not really formatted in a way to reliably learn valuable information, but is rather designed to provoke shallow discussion and emotional responses.

Talk shows and news anchors are basically the worst way to learn political stuff. Keeping up to the minute on stuff that's happening does not allow for an evidence based, structural view of politics. That kind of stuff doesn't get good ratings, and stuff that provokes outrage does. News TV doesn't suck because they're too hopelessly biased. It sucks because they set poor agendas and ask dumb questions and interview people the wrong people and that creates hopelessly partisan environments because those get viewers to tune in consistently.

If you want good sources for what's gong on, a professor or university poli sci department would tell you to read books written by political scientists. Beyond that, read quality newspapers, but not opinion or news content as much as the deep-dive investigative reporting. News is far less important than most people think it is. There's a lot of motion in politics but not a lot of that motion is actually going anywhere and being able to separate signal from noise is a very important skill to learn."

331,"Basically the title.

1) UBI is established. Everyone gets $1000 a month and slated to increase about 2% every year.

2) Since this increases disposable income, people go out and spend it. 

3) Consumer spending increases, which drives higher demand, which drives price increases

4) After a few years, the $1000/month doesn't go very far anymore, so activists lobby for an increase

5) After a few more years, UBI payout is doubled after Congress OKs it.

6) Since this increases disposable income, people go out and spend it.

7) Consumer spending increases...

&#x200B;

UBI is an interesting concept, and the slow march of automation is inevitable. Moreover, UBI could feasibly be paired with reduced employment (read: unemployment payments) responsibilities for employers. If employees can feasibly make it through the next month or something, then letting them go isn't as massive a deal. I think it is feasible to build a coalition around the concept, but I can't get over this thought experiment. Where am I wrong?","So it's important to remember two things when it comes to UBI. I'm not an expert in the proposal (because it was generally dead in the water when it was announced in the US).

The first is UBI is slated to replace some forms of welfare. So instead of the US also paying for food stamps, housing assistance, etc. all these welfare initiatives to help the poor, this would instead be replaced by UBI. So part of the UBI expense is being offset by removing other forms of welfare.

The second is, assuming UBI is being paid for with taxes beyond the above welfare amount, rich people won't actually see any UBI (in practicality). Let's take a person who makes $1 million a year. They may get the $1k a month check, but their taxes go up $2k a month to help fund the state welfare system (namely, UBI). So no EVERYONE would see the $1k/month, and instead see rising taxes on higher earners to offset the UBI. Of course this assumes a somewhat ""stable"" national debt, and YMMV based on the particular government/party running the show based on the political winds at the time.

But the same issue you're pointing out here could be the same issue for any welfare program, and it hasn't seemed to be an issue yet."
332,"It just seems to be a mechanism for the president to cover up corruption or lawbreaking, and impede congressional oversight.

It also isn't a power granted the president by the constitution.

Is there a valid use for it?

I have been wondering if we would be better off without it.","Of course! We mostly only hear about the dramatic uses of executive privilege, but there are many day-to-day things the president discusses or communicates with his staff that's better kept private. That's not necessarily a bad thing. For example, imagine if every bit of communication within the executive branch regarding foreign policy was accessible by the public. That...would be a very bad thing for complicated negotiations between countries that already have some tension with the US. Even on purely domestic matters, there is lots of value in being able to do your job knowing discarded ideas won't be brought up to drag your team through the mud. Lots of policy choices involve tradeoffs, and honestly there's value in being able to discuss that in purely utilitarian terms that only privacy can allow.

And for what it's worth, executive privilege does NOT allow to cover up corruption or lawbreaking. US v. Nixon established quite clearly that executive privilege is protected in the Constitution via separation of powers, but that it does not apply in cases of law breaking. Ultimately, individuals who use it like Trump uses it will lose in Court. There's just a bit of a process to get there, and often the folks asking him for things don't want to delay their investigation the amount of time it would take to defeat Trump's claims in court."

334,"It’s not like a Republican president would nominate a liberal to the 9th circuit, but the 9th cir. court is liberal like the states within it (California, Washington…)

Yet the same is the case for the 5th cir. court (Texas, Louisiana…), it tends to be conservative. 

Why are the courts so reflective of the states they cover and not more diverse?","A few reasons:

Back in the day (though much less today), Presidents relied on the members of Congress of both parties to recommend judges for their districts and circuits.  That’s the “advice” in “advice and consent.”  So conservative Senators from conservative states will recommend more conservative judges.  Home state Senators also used to (but in the last couple of years stopped) have the ability to single-handedly block or significantly delay judicial nominees in their state.  So, for instance, Ted Cruz could aggressively block Obama nominees in Texas in a way he couldn’t in California. 

That’s how it started.  Also, lawyers who are in the running for judgeships typically live in areas that match their political beliefs.

It perpetuates because of strategic retirement.  Conservative judges won’t retire during the Biden administration, etc.  So, liberal seats stay liberal and conservative seats stay conservative, unless a president fails to make an appointment, or someone dies."

It talks about the US's attempt to rebuild Iraq, specifically contrasting that effort against their good track record in Germany and Japan after WW2. I'd recommend that as a good starting point.

Unfortunately, there isn't really a short answer to your question. It depends on the laws of the country in question, their international relationships, their desire or need for political/social/economic reform, and more. Basically, sometimes, yes, the government will just build a new one. Sometimes they won't. It depends on all those things."
336,I know it has something to do with voting rights and districts but I'm confused as to what it would mean if it went to the states or the federal government. Would it take rights away or not really affect the general public. I need a simple explanation because I'm very confused.,"So the lawsuit comes down to the interpretation of a clause in the Constitution.

In particular, this case comes down to the phrase about holding elections:

>The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereo...

So previously, states can (and did) impose requirements on how the state legislatures do business. For example, some states require that any district lines drawn for Congress be signed by the governor, or the state courts can overturn districts that go against the state Constitution.

The case at play here was from the 2021 North Carolina redistricting based on the 2020 census results. The state legislature created new maps that were ""gerrymandered"" to give the Republicans more power in the state. The Democrats in the state sued, and the NC Supreme Court ruled the maps inadmissible as violating the state Constitution for ""equal power of each person's voice"".

The Republicans are challenging that by saying the phrase from the Constitution gives the state legislatures, and the legislatures alone, the power to decide how elections are operated and develop maps without any other state interference. They claim neither the Executive Branch nor Judicial Branch of North Carolina are Constitutionally allowed to overrule the Legislative Branch on how elections are operated.

Note that what this would mean would be based on what exactly SCOTUS writes in their opinions.

But if ruled without details, it would mean that state legislatures reserve the right to determine all election related operations, as long as they are in agreement with federal law. So state legislatures would be free to draw whatever districts they want and neither the Executive Branch (the governor) or the state Judicial Branch would be able to stop or interfere with them. From a general public perspective, it means the legislature will be able to determine all election laws and procedures without checks & balances from the rest of the state government. This would likely sway states with single-party legislatures to create rules, districts, and policies that favor their party, similar to gerrymandering now.

If given leeway, it also gives state legislatures a lot more freedom in how to decide who gets what votes from the state. For example, if the state legislature is the sole decider of election law, they could theoretically reject the popular vote of the state and give state electors to another candidate (for example, Arizona in 2020 could have given their electors to Trump instead of Biden).

Whether that would happen is yet to be seen, but if the ruling is in favor of the Republicans here, it gives the state legislatures unilateral power to control elections in their state in accordance with federal law.

If the Democrats win the lawsuit, everything proceeds as it has for the history of our country, where state laws and actions by the state legislatures are still subject to Executive and/or Judicial Branch checks and balances."

338,"Brit here who's doing his best to learn and keep an eye on the US political situation (or rather inherently learns a lot from scrolling through reddit).

In recent weeks, after the Roe vs Wade decision, a number of people have been getting very worried about a future hearing in the supreme court that might validate 'Independent State Legislature Doctrine'. The core fear is that it could allow republican led (often via gerrymandering) legislatures to vote and give a republican candidate their states electoral college votes even when their state voted for the democrats party, ergo letting them steal the election.

Now, from what I've gathered all states get to decide how to submit their electoral college votes, and their laws have generally tied this to the popular votes in the state. Now, that is almost always all electoral college votes go to the candidate who won the state, though a state could perfectly well decide to split them proportionally to the candidates vote share. This is the principle that ISLD is trying to grow out of.

Now I've also heard of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Where states put into law that, if enough other states have signed the law to have an electoral college majority, they will all pool their votes behind whichever candidate wins the popular vote, regardless of which won the individual state. Again, basing itself off the principle that the state can choose who its electors are/ going to vote for.

Now my question is this. ISLD is contentious and going to the supreme court as it'd allow the states to break from their popular vote. But surely the NPRVIC would suffer the exact same legal issues, if not rely on the exact same principle, that a state can put their electoral votes to someone who their residents didn't choose. So why is the former requiring of legal validation, and the other (as far as I read) seemingly viewed as a 'put in law and it's done?'

- Note, nothing here is talking about the morality of either scheme (one could potentially cause the end of democracy and civil war, the other is an attempt to make sure the will of the people is always heard), just the legal principles/ technicalities behind them.","I think that the constitution is clear here, the state legislatures shall direct and appoint electors. The key difference, however, is that the Napovointerco (look up CGP Grey he's awesome) seeks to cast it's votes with the majority of the nation at large, even if it means ignoring how the people of that state vote. The other doctrine you refer to is a fringe reading that says state legislatures have all the say in all matters regarding how federal elections in that state happen. This is not true, the constitution is quite clear that the federal government has authority, in many cases, over how federal elections are done. At the end of the day however, the states are the ones that ultimately run the elections and print all the ballots. Now, this ISLD doctrine is very much a conservative cop out, to put it mildly, to say that federal laws regarding voter rights and gerrymandering and so on are invalid, which again is not true, but the courts may not see it that way given that the constitution doesn't say what exactly the federal government can regulate about the election process. It has always been interpreted to have a wide meaning granting congress a wide range of powers to expand voter access where states have traditionally denied it (barring federal or state constitutional amendments)."
339,"Since congress decides annual federal judiciary funding priorities, and its budget, why aren't Dems rattling the saber of shifting funding priorities? Congress decides if the lower courts exist at all and could strip them of jurisdictional power. As far as I am aware the constitution only stipulates the funding of the Supreme Court Justices themselves... nothing about funding the bloated court system granted by congress.","This would essentially tear down the federal judiciary. These cases like Dobbs with such  size and ramifications are far and few. The federal judiciary also includes run of the mill immigration appeals and bankruptcy cases, employment discrimination cases, diversity cases, etc. Most courts everywhere are already overworked. 

But, too answer your question, yes. Congress can decrease the funding of the federal judiciary. Judges are guaranteed constitutional protection for their pay in that their pay can never be diminished while in office. So, the jobs lost or with reduced pay will be court staff and staff attorneys. 

Dems are also not “rattling the saber of shifting funding priorities” because the ramifications are clear in that it would just cause decreased court efficiency and longer cases for litigants and the accused."

Also, both places are small and have relatively little in the way of resources.","Why should it? It accomplished its goals.

Just start with wiki.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_anti-abortion_movement

There were various abortion bans on the books in many states and it was not a top issue for most. The issue becomes supercharged after Roe. 

Catholics especially bishops were against abortion always. Becomes a top political priority after Roe. 

No big political successes until the Reagan Revolution. Catholics somehow find common ground with evangelicals on the abortion issue. A political coalition is born taking over Republican politics and enacting policies. 

For those not Christian, Catholics and evangelicals are not naturally friends. It may seem so today, but for hundreds of years lots of bad blood. Strange bedfellows politics makes and it has kept up for 40 years."

> The dispute arose from the ambiguity in nomenclature between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon.

I'm curious what ""oath"" they were sworn to during the hearings, and if that oath holds any legal power over them.","Potential Supreme Court justices testify before the Senate judiciary committee during their nomination hearings. They take this oath before every hearing: “Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give before the committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?”

347,"USA makes a big deal out of people having free speech but aside from obvious dictatorships, I'm curious what other countries don't have free speech and how that affects daily life.","The UK doesn't have a written constitution, so its speech protections are only by statute, meaning the parliament can change it with a simple majority vote. Their statutory speech protections are also much more limited than the US's 1st Amendment protections. There have been many cases of people being arrested and jailed/fined in the UK for posting ""offensive"" words on Twitter, for example.

There are several countries in Europe that will jail you for denying that there was a mass killing of Jews during WW2, or for giving a Nazi salute or possessing Nazi literature, or many other things.

In the US, the only types of speech that aren't protected by the First Amendment are:

* conspiracy to commit a crime (must include the target, the type of crime, and a certain degree of specificity about time and place),

* intentional lying that causes reputational or physical harm to someone, or defrauds them (i.e. libel/slander, shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded room to cause a stampede when you knew there was no fire, making false claims about a product you're selling, etc.)

349,"I keep hearing people say the next crucial step for abortion rights is to have Congress pass a law making it a national right. 

Setting aside for a second how unlikely that might be in the near future (given the ideological makeup of Congress), would this not also be shot down by SCOTUS for the exact same reason set out in Dobbs? 

I understand that the majority in Dobbs took the position that abortion rights, since not tied to any fundamental right conferred by the Constitution, must come from the states themselves. Congress is an arm of the federal government, and are empowered to act only as far as the Constitution allows. If Congress tried to pass an abortion law, that would be the exact same kind of extra-Constitutional federal overreach that they rejected in Dobbs, and they might not even need to do anything in their rejection of the law other than just point to Dobbs. 

Please know that I believe abortion rights are fundamental and should be protected; I see how the Dobbs decision is tragic and think steps need to be taken to enshrine this right. But short of every state coming to their senses and legalizing it, is it not true that the only thing that could feasibly work on a federal level to confer abortion rights would be to pass a Constitutional amendment that is supported by 2/3 of Congress and ratified by 38 states?","No, because Dobbs wasn't talking about legislation, but unenumerated rights.  The reasoning was that there was no legitimate source for abortion being a right. If Congress passed that law, it would be that source"

Despite this, literally no one says Dems have a shot at the house. What makes the house so much more difficult for Dems?","2 year election cycles make the house more vulnerable to political whims. And like others said, gerrymandering makes for disproportionate power of rural voters. So if the rural vote rolls out, it will bring more Republicans into the house.

I wish the public had access to more information or maybe I’m in the dark.","The public has access to all information about this (textbooks are easily obtainable and all Supreme Court and other legal opinions are available for nothing, or virtually nothing)… but, there’s a reason a legal education costs an arm and a leg. It’s complex.

The long and the short of it is that “substantive due process” has been considered a flimsy concept in legal circles for a long time. Due process is generally considered to be a procedural issue.. But, that doesn’t excuse the SC from what they did. They overturned 50 years of precedent to take away an established right. It’s never been done."

353,"Anarchism, defined by Wikipedia, is a political philosophy and movement that is skeptical of authority and rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy.[1] Anarchism calls for the abolition of the state, which it holds to be unnecessary, undesirable, and harmful. As a historically left-wing movement, placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum, it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian Marxism as the libertarian wing (libertarian socialism) of the socialist movement, and has a strong historical association with anti-capitalism and socialism.

According to this, anarchism is the most extreme left-wing ideology; they fight against the concept of state and law in the name of freedom.  They are further left than the bolsheviks were.

How far right can you get?  Is it fascism, or can you go even further right?  Would it be some form of theocratical fascism that hasn't existed yet?  Would the most farthest right reactionary ideology want to build a time machine and literally go back in time?  But, how far?","The origin of the left-right political spectrum comes from the French Revolution. When the National Assembly moved to Paris (from Versailles) they met in a large hall with stadium-style seating along the two sides (think kind of like a high school basketball court). Members of the Assembly organically chose to sit with other like-minded members. Those members who supported the absolutist monarchy sat on the right side while those who wanted a republican constitution sat on the left.

In very broad sense, the farther right you go fewer people hold political power. The farther left you go more people hold political power. As you noted, the farthest left you can get is anarchism, in which everyone holds equal political power by dint of there not being a centralized power structure. The extreme opposite would be an absolutist monarchy/dictatorship in which a single individual holds all political power."

355,"Say 3 trillion dollars are collected by the federal government, by what means, if any, can US citizens see where that money is going? If 800 billion is spent on the military, is it possible to see how its spent? Such as how much of that is going towards upkeep of foreign military bases, payroll, or research? How much is going towards the purchase of weapons, fuel, spares parts, etc.? It seems to me that having the transparency of knowing how much of our budget is being spent on actual necessities and how much is going towards corporations/CEO bonus packages is important to know and is only discussed vaguely because of how little we know about the way in which our tax dollars are being spent.","First of all, I think it's important to note that taxes don't really ""pay for"" spending strictly speaking. The Congress decides how much it wants to tax and how much it wants to spend, but those things don't necessarily need to go together. In fact, the government in the US almost always spends more than it taxes (which we call deficit spending).

The Congressional Budget Office, among other groups, keeps track of the spending that the federal government does. Very broadly speaking, spending is often put into three groups: entitlement spending, which includes social security, Medicare and Medicaid; defense spending, which is all things military; and ""discretionary spending"", which is basically everything else.

Entitlements and discretionary spending are, for the most part, pretty easy to track. The black hole is defense spending. For obvious reasons, the military and state security agencies do not want to publicize all the things they spend money on. Even the people who should have oversight often cannot account for the amount of money spent.

Donald Rumsfeld, secretary of defense under George Bush, stated early in the administration that his department could not account for roughly 2.3 trillion in military spending. The date that he said that? September 10, 2001. Needless to say, the events of the following day overshadowed this news, and instead of demanding more accountability from the defense department, we began shoveling in tremendous amounts of money in order to fight two foreign wars. So if there is an issue with transparency in spending, our military (and state security agencies like CIA, FBI, NSA, etc) is far and away the biggest culprit."

The time that leaders spend on such tours is usually a mix of foreign policy discussions/negotiations and leisure (golfing, skiing, whatever makes the negotiations go smoother).

Different kinds of world leaders usually have different objectives when they go abroad. A head of state, such as the Emperor of Japan, will mostly engage in cultural exchange and symbolic acts (many heads of state don't have much say over policy, so they act as figureheads). A head of government, such as the Prime Minister of Iraq, may focus more on policy (trade, defense, foreign aid, etc). Someone who is both head of state and head of government, such as the President of the United States, will often do a mix of both."
360,Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade Ruling.,"The right to privacy here was built out of the fourteenth amendment. Basically, there’s a clause which says the states cannot abridge any rights of citizens in the same way that the federal government couldn’t prior. Roe vs. Wade (and a couple others mentioned by Justice Thomas) was directed as a challenge to state abortion laws, therefore part of the legal strategy was a fourteenth amendment appeal to the Supreme Court. 

At the time this legal strategy was built inside a framework surrounding a right to privacy that other cases established (e.g. Griswold v. Connecticut). The court’s majority opinion, as I understand it, essentially says this right doesn’t apply to abortion. 

As far as your connection to the fourth amendment argument, that would be a question for an attorney. I’m not sure if the legal strength of that argument or if it could work. That argument was not a basis for the original ruling and thus would have to be brought by another case and decided in that way by the court.

361,"I think there are two potential routes. Could Congress write a law that said, ""Abortion shall be legal everywhere""? I'm not sure whether this would create an anti-commandeering issue. Requiring states to make abortion legal would obviously create an anti-commandeering issue, and I'm not sure whether the law I'm describing constitutes that. Assuming there weren't an AC issue, federal law beats state law, so abortion would be legal.

And under the Commerce Clause, couldn't the federal government just set up abortion clinics wherever it wants? Abortion obviously has a substantial impact on interstate commerce — there are a million studies demonstrating its economic value. And federal law trumps state law. So why aren't more people proposing this? I don't see why it wouldn't work.","I don't know that your specifics are completely correct, but broadly speaking, yes, we could indeed pass federal legislation that protects abortion rights. Federal law does trump state law unless there is some other legal issue, so in a very simple sense, yes, this would work.

As to why it isn't being done, well, they actually did try. After the draft opinion was released, the Dems put forward a bill that would have codified abortion protections into law. The bill never even got to a vote because the Reps filibustered it.

And THAT's the crux of the issue. The reason we don't just solve these problems with federal law right now is because passing meaningful federal law is impossible thanks to our anti-majoritarian structures. This is EXACTLY why the Framers warned specifically against a filibuster mechanic. We don't pass bills because we can't pass bills because all it takes is vocal minority to oppose something and it's completely dead. That's where we are with your proposal."

Several of the justices who overturned Roe v Wade mentioned that they believe it should be up to elected officials and government to make the call, but it's entirely possible that the federal government creating such a law would run afoul of their intentions and they'd find some reason to say only states can create such laws."

So this begs the question, why is the FDA banning E-Cigs but not banning real cigarettes who are harming many more people then E-Cigs. My grandma for one died from smoking cigarettes so why this double standard?

Edit: I just saw that they were planning to harm cigarettes by lowering the nicotine content. And I totally support that. Nicotine products are cancerous literally, but you shouldn't ban one product over the other because its *new,* ban all nicotine products so people don't do shitty drugs that have no positive impact but give you cancer. ","Regarding your edit, this isn't Juul getting banned because it is new. The FDA would love to treat all nicotine products equally, but they probably literally can't because when the law governing regulation of nicotine products were written, vapes didn't exist and so the law wasn't written with language broad enough to anticipate the invention of vapes. The whole point is that vapes *aren't* regulated nearly as much as cigarettes because the law just hasn't adjusted yet to this new invention, so the FDA is legally bound to approach this in a different way.

This is why legislating can't just be a neutral, zero sum game as the default. We need to be able to pass laws without having enormous campaigns to attract well beyond majority support because that's how we have folks address things like this. This isn't near the top of anyone's priority list, for good reason, and the reality is that getting stuff like this fixed just tends not to happen when majoritarian principles aren't followed in your government."
367,And if not what's missing for it to become one?,"No. For two main  reasons

1) Every member state maintains independent foreign and defense policies. They all maintain bilateral relations with non-member states separately, sign treaties and engage in military operations independently. Some of them are NATO members and others are not for instance. 

2) The EU has very little power to enforce EU law on member-states if the member state doesn't want to cooperate. The EU can set monetary policy and some trade policies, but on all other issues the EU essentially works on consensus. If a single-member state opposes something it doesn't happen. If a member-state does end up violating an EU policy or law, again they have very little they can do. Think about what happens if an American state defies the federal government. When southern states refused to follow the ruling of Brown v. BoD, the federal government sent in the national guard to force schools to integrate. If an EU member state violates an EU policy, the EU can basically consider withholding funds, and that's about it."
368,"Basically blowing up Ukraine's military in their barracks before they could mobilize.

I have gotten the impression that Putin basically misled his military into believing that his ""special military operation"" was a kind of soft invasion that would be greeted as liberators, that the message to the Ukrainian military was ""stay in your barracks"", because Putin believed they would be intimidated enough to not want to fight.

As such, over 100,000 troops that could have been killed almost overnight survived the initial stages of the invasion.

Of course, that wouldn't have necessarily made occupying Ukraine's civilian population much easier, and it is somewhat outside the scope of this question as to how the invasion would have gone differently.","I assume most of the Ukrainian military sleeps in their homes on any given night, which would be distributed across the country."

372,DOes it have anything to do with brexit or anything like that? How is it affecting the rest of the world?,"In very broad and simpler terms, a combination of labour shortages, supply chain disruption, post-COVID rebound economics, and post-Brexit trade problems have led to massive spikes in inflation (9% in the UK, expected to be 11%) and cost of living rises in the UK. Additionally, especially around COVID, the national government invested heavily into British railways to basically pay them fixed fees to keep running services - despite reduced ridership (and also at risk to workers). Ridership has not recovered still to pre-pandemic levels (actually at roughly 1/5th of pre-pandemic levels). 

In the face of all of that, rail workers were proposed a 2% raise in wages (and a 2% raise in wages, against 9-11% inflation, that means most workers would actually be facing effectively a reduction in wages in terms of actual purchasing power). And given reduced ridership, it was proposed to cut a number of personnel to reduce costs. 

So the rail workers went on strike to demand better. 

It's not all related to Brexit obviously. Inflation has been hitting most countries following COVID and now especially with the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (both massive hits in particular for energy and agriculture costs globally). That being said, Brexit has had some impact. But in discussing economic impact, it's never as simple as this was responsible for x percentage of this versus this having x percentage impact."
373,"Just curious about the whole situation, a bit of context would also help!","We the public can deal with any bad decisions that our politicians make, more or less, because we have the option to change things around in our leadership later if we don't like it, or if it gets bad enough.

When I hear this (and I happen to agree with the right being suggested), my next thought is a hypothetical retort to the response above, which is always ""....okay, then why don't we MAKE it a right?"" I decided to Google this today, to figure out whether that was possible, and I've arrived at *City of Boerne v. Flores* (1997), a SCOTUS case in which the majority held basically that -

* SCOTUS has the sole power to define the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment
* Congress cannot add to or subtract from these rights
* Congress can pass laws to guarantee rights ""not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court,"" but only in an effort to ""prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court.""

I remember reading (some time ago, I can't remember where) that there is a line of jurisprudence that basically says this, holding essentially that people only actually have so many rights; that a person is only entitled to the rights granted by nature (whatever that means) and that the most Congress can do is ""uncover"" these already-existing rights and legislate accordingly to protect them.

I don't understand this, because it seems like it doesn't exactly comport with the idea of a constitution that may be amended. So far as I can tell, SCOTUS' job consists of determining whether an action/law comports with the Constitution. To my understanding, a question of whether something is Constitutional naturally must consider the Constitution's amendments as well as its substantive text; because amendments are part of the Constitution, amendments are, by definition, constitutional (I know many people tend to think ""constitutional"" just stands for ""my personal belief of what is good, true, and American"", but that can't be the case). So theoretically, if an amendment is passed that granted a specific right, would SCOTUS have a leg to stand on in invalidating it, and if so, on what grounds (either procedural or substantive)?

Take, for example, the idea of universal healthcare. Setting aside for a second whether one agrees with this being a reasonable solution to the issue of health care costs (as well as the likelihood that the country at large could even come to an agreement on this issue), suppose that the procedure for constitutional amendment was followed completely and an amendment was passed, declaring access to healthcare a human right and empowering Congress to legislate accordingly. I'm sure someone could argue somehow that access to healthcare is already a right by virtue of being under the umbrella of some other right, but assuming for a minute that it isn't:

Would the act of enshrining this right in a constitutional amendment put the argument to rest outside the reach of SCOTUS (specifically with regard to the authority it described itself as having in *Boerne*)? If not, what is the line of legal thinking that provides support for this? Am I misunderstanding SCOTUS' description of its authority in *Boerne* (so that this isn't what they were referring to at all)?","The constitution can be amended. It requires two actions: 1) 2/3 of both houses must approve the amendment and then 3/4 of the states must approve the amendment for it to be effective. The amendment could add additional ‘rights’ as referenced.

Also, after the amendment passed it likely would have to pass SCOTUS review IF there was conflict with another part of the Constitution."
375,"I'm curious if we're heading for two years of complete stalemate, or if either party will be able to accomplish any agenda items before the next presidential election?

I get it...the Republicans essentially have a simple majority today based on who some of the ""Democrat"" Senators are.","Essentially, they will be able to block *everything* and pass *nothing.* Biden will have to govern exclusively by executive authority. 

The main thing that a Senate majority will give Republicans, besides stopping all legislation in its tracks, is the ability to hold symbolic votes on whatever right-wing cause they want, without any consequences because those laws will never make it past the house or the veto. 

I will say though that it's far more likely that Democrats keep the Senate and lose the house, just because of which senate seats are up right now."
376,"I’m drawn to why global regions seem to go though similar political movements simultaneously. What comes to mind recently is the Arab Spring across much of the Muslim world 2009-2012, then again 2015-2019 when many Western countries had a string of elections which were dominated/strongly contested by right-wing candidates and issues. South America seems to be going through a leftward lunge currently, such as in Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Argentina, and as of today Colombia. These are 4 of the 5 largest economies on the continent. 

I know 3 instances is barely a dataset, but I’d love to read more about it. I’m sure one could find more examples when looking at the last half of the 20th century. At the very least, these movements seem to take place in a 2-5 year time span in demographically similar countries. I suppose this is because countries don’t all hold elections at the same time, but perhaps concerns within one country about civil rights, economic opportunity, immigration, etc. might be taking place in a similar country. Is there any research on this possible phenomenon? Could you recommend some literature? Thanks.","To be really simple, political movements are effects and effects come from causes. In countries that are similar, the causes are often similar, and so the effects are often similar. It's very important to understand that politics is structural--when you have certain conditions, they contribute to certain outcomes, and while politics is far from deterministic, there is enough correlation that we can analyze situations for patterns and predict outcomes. 

Great ways to dive more deeply into this concept is to study comparative politics. There are about a hundred introductions to the topic of varying degrees of length and style. All of them are probably going to be fairly similar and worth a look. The one I read was a textbook called *Comparative Politics* by Clark, Golder, and Golder, and I'd recommend it. Another option for a very broad survey that talks a bit about this concept is *Why Nations Fail* by Robinson and Acemoglu."
377,"Both of them look the exact same to me, both believe and emphasize social and economic liberty in their beliefs. Are they sinonimous or there is a diference?","Libertarianism is an ideology that is also defined by its critical view of the state.  They just don't emphasize ""liberty"" but believe the state itself often has a negative impact on freedom.  The term itself was actually popularized by Anarchists, and wasn't picked up by free-market advocates until the 1960s in a blatant attempt to co-opt the term.  Also, not all libertarians support free market ideas and many are anti-capitalist, notably Anarchists."
378,"There has to be something I am missing. Biden's career is tanked, and his ratings are still dropping. Which in turn seems to be hurting his entire party. Even if wasn't however due to his age and I assume lowered aspirations he isn't looking ahead to his political career (which is normally a reason). It has come out that student loan forgiveness has a surprising amount of bi-partisan support. So does this situation revolve around fears of even more inflation? I assume there has to be a good reason that I don't understand.","1.	It could alienate anyone who paid off their student loans and are forced to deal with the impacts of the lack of repayment of the debt.
2.	Those with student loans are younger and don’t vote in large numbers, so they wont bother to vote even if he does this for them.
3.	There are legal questions if he can do it.
4.	. There is a budgetary cost.
5.	He can not forgive private student loans, so that will alienate those who will be ignorant of the difference."
379,"I often hear that Evo Morales was overthrown by the CIA. However, I doubt this claim because:

* Instead of being replaced by a military dictatorship (like what happened in Chile in 1973), Bolivia's democratic system continued
* Morales' party managed to win the presidency again in the following election
* The leader who replaced Morales, is now going to prison for breaching the constitution

All of this seems to indicate that if the CIA did coup Evo Morales, they did so very ineptly, and ultimately failed to achieve their goal of stamping out socialism in Bolivia.

**Edit**: Also, [neither Russia nor the PRC criticised Morales' overthrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_2019_Bolivian_political_crisis). Either this means that the overthrow wasn't a CIA coup, or that Morales was such a pariah that both Russia and the PRC are OK with the CIA overthrowing him.","No, Morales was overthrown by domestic forces with the police and military abandoning him being the point where he was pretty much done.  Most legitimate accusations against the USA isn't that we removed him personally, but that we waged a propaganda war that helped de-legitimized him and supported groups who were against him.  However, in situations like this the exact nature of USA involvement will probably not be known until decades later, if ever.

I should also note that the CIA doesn't actually do that many coups, despite popular belief, or at least they directly don't.  What generally happens is the American intelligence, military and related groups become friendly with certain groups within a country and help provide them with aid, and sorta let them do the dirty work.  In more involved situations, like the Allande situation, they will gladly wage an intelligence war and even offer funding of some sort but they generally do not have the actual ability to directly remove people and thus are very reliant on a local strong men to do that.  In some cases, like what happened in South Korea on two occasions, the domestic group will pretty much make their move without getting any input from the USA on the grounds that they are confident that they can ""apologize later."""

381,"I'm assuming it was appointment of individuals into positions of power, granting them this status in return for their subservience or support?

But what were the patronage positions? I can only think of federal appointments as we have them today,  secretary of state,  etc, although those are a different beast compared to the talented farmer who can rouse his self- centered community in a way that may threaten to federalist (using Lippmann's terms here).","Prior to Civil Service reforms in the 1880s, every single job in the federal government could be directly hired and fired by the President. So it wasn't a matter of giving people power so much as it was a source of giving people jobs. If you're a Republican and you become President, you're appointing a prominent town Republican to be the postmaster in every town and that person is hiring only Republicans to carry the mail. The same happened with state and local jobs, which created machines- you're a local leader, and you control x number of jobs cleaning the streets. People join your party to get those jobs, and voted your way to get better service from the city government. The more votes you controlled, the higher you would rise into state and then federal politics, becoming a governor or a Senator controlling directly or indirectly through your cronies nearly every government job in the state. Imagine if every government worker, from the mail carrier to the firefighters to the DMV clerk had to be party members in good standing. That's what the patronage system was."
382,"I know they're ""supposed"" to be, but as an American that keeps up with current events, I've not really heard news about an Iranian threat.

I feel as if they couldn't last a year in a mechanized war, especially against the US and our allies.","Iran has the ability to cause problems in their own region, but their power projection capabilities can't do much beyond their own back yard.  Their nuclear program is mostly about ensuring that they won't be invaded by the USA like their neighbor Iraq was.  So George W. Bush gave the Iranians quite the education of why to get the bomb."
383,"Hi! So I am not well versed, when it comes to politics, but I was trying to read up on fascism on wikipedia and there was constant mention of fascism being anti-conservatism. Does it only count related to the economical spectrum or what's the deal? As english is not my first language, it's been really hard to comprehend based on the material I was able to find online. Thank you in advance for helping me understand!","Conservatives, by my simplest definition, supports tradition and resists change. William Buckley described conservatives as confronting progressives by hold up their hand and saying, ""Stop!"" In the US, conservatives are now known for favoring small government and unregulated capitalism. In Soviet Union, conservatives would, several generations after the revolution, support a government6controlled economy. Stalinists would be conservative in Soviet Union.

384,"I am a political science major but I have never been active on social media. I have accounts in the same name but I haven't logged in for years anywhere. r/politics and r/PoliticalDiscussion seem hostile and uninviting. Is there anywhere that I can talk with other people about politics, if not here?","Online political discussions are kind of sucky most of the time. Period. People act differently online, and even if they don't, the conversations are hard because you can't really respond to someone directly in real time like you can in a conversation. Even if you're going back and forth on a comment thread refuting each other word for word, you can't really force someone to go back and clarify a definition, or stay on the point, or anything like that. 

The best you can do is find a community that really values good faith. This sub is a good example where the questions asked and the answers given tend to be of fairly high quality. I've very active in other political subs where that's not nearly so true, unfortunately.

There's an abundant amount of evidence that the best place to talk politics is actually with other people in real life face to face conversations. That's uncomfortable for many, but really that's the clear best way to engage politically. Good luck."

Was it enough to change the calculus of gerrymandered districts in 2022, and presumably 2024?","The blue-to-red migrants are primarily the red residents of blue states. So what you're seeing is less of a re-shuffle than a sorting.

In terms of how it will affect gerrymandering, it probably won't. Racial gerrymanders will continue as they have before, as will political gerrymanders. The migration patterns are unlikely to affect the overall political balance of most states except in the sense of making the blue bluer and the red redder."

392,"* **International Relations.** I say this as someone who studied International Relations in university. While the major mainstream IR theories (Liberalism, Realism, etc.) are often presented as nonpartisan and non-normative, a lot of times both of the major ""isms"" are used in think tank, policy, academic, etc. circles to advocate for foreign interventionism, military aggression, and democracy promotion in a way that aligns with neo-conservatism. Alternately, Realist theories are sometimes used as a rationale for the extreme policies of isolationism, stringent immigration restrictions, and protectionism advocated (albeit with different rationales) by right-wing libertarians and the far right. When you look up various foreign policy think tanks or have read a lot of academic work produced on foreign policy within the United States, a large chunk of knowledge production tends to be (imo) informed by these biases. Adding to this when I was in university, it was entirely taboo to criticize the U.S. military or its actions abroad within the context of an academic discussion on International Relations. There appear to be few or no organizations or expert circles who advocate a progressive or left-leaning alternative to how mainstream International Relations/Foreign Policy thought is typically applied.
* **Economics**. Economics tends to be stereotyped as a field that is all about believing impoverished individuals deserve their lot in life, to the point where ""economic expertise"" can be read as code for institutionalized classism that is reified within academia and within organizations attempting to influence policy at the national level. Intersecting with International Relations, it is relatively rare to see academic critiques of Free Trade or of the ""Free Market"", except in academic fields like Geography where it is seen as taboo to discuss how the academic work might influence policy in any meaningful way. I get that part of this is due to funding sources, with well-resourced conservative donors attempting to influence what is taught in Economics programs and how it is taught. It also appears that the majority of Economic policy-based think tanks at least lean somewhat right wing. However, there does not appear to be much in the way of any left-leaning alternatives.

Why are these fields seemingly dominated heavily by right wing organizations and talking points, given the stereotype that academia and the well-educated individuals or organizations it produces lean left?","Not an expert here but I think there are 2 general answers that might help.

1. US specific answer: The Cold War pushed US culture, politics, and academia to the right, skewing the political spectrum (Overton window). There tend to be more left wing departments and fields of study outside of the US. For instance, quite a non US universities have programs in the study communism, which is very rare here.

2. General answer: the system will promote ideologies which support its status quo and vice versa. People who benefit from the status quo are those who currently hold power and influence, of course they will dominate the discussion, and continue to argue for these systems. This would likely also happen under say a communist system, where capitalist ideology would be fringe, although perhaps to a lesser degree due to a lack of market influence.

Also side note: as someone who has done academic research in public policy, almost no organization in the US is going to fund research against their usually purely capitalist interest."
393,"To clarify, I am talking about a gradual and slow transition into dictatorship that is achieved by acquiring more privileges over time, just like Augustus was awarded privileges by the senate which allowed him to establish his rule and turn Rome into an empire.

Running out the clock on bills happens all the time. Sometimes this is gamesmanship--this way folks can avoid getting caught voting against a bill, or they can introduce legislation they have no intention to vote for, etc. Things like that. Other times it's just a matter of passing legislation is hard work and folks are actively trying to move it along but they just run out of time or it gets put behind other things of higher importance.

Denazification was the name for policies taken by the Allies (especially France, America, and  Britain). The USSR took part as well but was less interested) when they occupied Germany after World War II), who aimed to destroy support for Nazism and prevent Germany from being taken over again. 

This included;

*  Preventing people with ties to the Nazi regime, but not close enough to be arrested, from remaining or gaining power or influence in either government, business, or the cultural world. 
* Widely publicizing Nazi horrors to the German public, forcing Germans to watch the Nuremberg Trials, and taking Germans to see Concentration camps 
* Prohibiting the publication of Nazi ideas and sentiments. 

Similar efforts took place in either area of Allied occupation but with less intensity. 

Denazification largely ended when the U.S. decided they wanted a strong West Germany as a buffer between Western Europe and the USSR. 

Since then the term hadn't really been used until Putin revived it as his ad hoc justification for war. 

So if Denazification is taking steps to prevent Nazis or Nazi-like groups from taking power, Nazification is taking steps to make it possible for Nazis to take power. But again it's not a term anyone really uses."

Israeli foreign policy is shackled by two realities.

First, they can't really afford to go around making unnecessary enemies. Picking sides in a Ukraine/Russia conflict does nothing for Israel. Neither side is likely to support Israel's interests out of gratitude in return.

Second, whenever Israel supports anything, it has enemies who will automatically oppose it.

399,"With all of the talk on gun control recently and banning assault rifles, I was wondering if the US federal government would be allowed to regulate the usage of ammunition.

2. When a gun is allowed to be loaded with ammunition (for example only allowing a gun to be loaded when actively in use at a gun range or while hunting - otherwise the gun has to be unloaded)

Would this violate the 2nd amendment? I'm mainly thinking, what does ""bear Arms"" mean?","One is legal but a bad idea. We want gun owners to practice with their guns. 

Two would be unconstitutional because the courts have recognized a right to self defense, which requires a gun to be loaded."
400,"This question is inspired by this article: [World's most powerful passport list impacted by Ukraine conflict](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/henley-index-world-best-passport-2022/index.html)

Why do some countries' citizens have visa-free access to so many countries? What are their governments doing to make their passport ""powerful""? 

On a side note, if a political party were to promise in their election campaign to make the passport more powerful, how can they go about achieving this?","We can see some clues in a list of the world's strongest passports.

You'll notice the strongest passports are mostly rich and western aligned nations. In fact, of the 34 strongest passports, 33 are western aligned. (Or 32 of 34 if you dont want to count Switzerland as western aligned.) 

Our next clue is in what a strong passport is doing. The passport being strong means other countries want that countries citizen's to be able to visit very easily. 

This tells us that large amounts of the world want rich westerners to come visit, or are concerned about the ramifications of making it harder for rich westerners to come visit. 

Basically, most countries want the money that a European or, say, an American will bring with them when they come visit. They also want to allow ease of travel for citizen's to help with diplomatic relations. It's not very friendly to make it hard for a countries citizen's to stop by for a week. Most of the world wants good relations with the rich and powerful west, and the money their citizen's bring.

For a nation to strengthen its passport, it could choose to focus on making itself richer, and more aligned with the overlapping treaties that form the base of the western bloc's alliances. Alternatively. If it wanted to avoid big picture changes and just hyper focus on this topic, said nation could try to horse trade away things or rights in exchange for a foriegn power granting the country's citizens ease of travel. Maybe something like ""well invest 2 billion into your nation in exchange for a drop in the visa requirement."""

Why is that?","Democracies happen slowly and gradually, and remain only when their economies and institutions are strong in the long run. Russia, despite its status as a world power, is a rather poor country. Half of its people make less than $5500 a year. Its history has been one of famine, theft and autocracy. The collapse of communism, while doing away with much of state's direct control over people, also contributed to widespread shortages of food and other commodities. Such desperation breeds competition for power and wealth, increasing the likelihood of bribery, embezzlement and coups."
404,"Australia (and more recently, New Zealand) are often held as examples of successful gun control in response to mass shootings. But as Jacinda Ardern herself has said, [New Zealand gun culture is about pest control and hunting instead of owning military-grade arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qai8LdcY9LQ), and I can attest to it being similar here in Australia. Contrast this with the USA, where gun ownership is seen as a means of opposing tyranny and a means to defend the country.

But there are other countries with gun cultures resulting in widespread military-grade firearms ownership too, such as Finland, Switzerland and Israel. While the USA's situation may not be comparable to Australia and New Zealand, what are Finland, Switzerland and Israel doing so that they can have widespread military-grade firearms ownership without the problem of mass shootings?","All of those countries require you to have a license to own and carry a gun (which most states in the U.S. do not require)

Israel, Finland, and Switzerland all have (near) universal conscription which means that everyone is fully trained to use a gun safely in the military. 

 In order to get a permit in NZ, you need a ""lawfull purpose"" for using a firearm, which cannot include self-defense. You also need to take a written test, have two references, and undergo a mental health evaluation"
405,"For example, Wouldn’t lax gun laws be considered a threat to the US government? Can’t a state or the government sanction US states like sanctioning foreign governments? Couldn’t other states sanction another state?","It's just a matter of definition and basic Constitutional law.  Once we start throwing states out of the country in order to impose sanctions, in what sense do we have a country any more?  Isn't this a fast track to dissolving America?"
406,"I ask this as an (uninformed) American myself. I, like most people, have been consistently distraught by these mass shootings. One of the main things people talk about needing to change is having stricter gun laws, because they are supposedly very lax now. 

But I don't feel like I have enough idea of what the gun laws are to have proper context around it. 

Here's what I understand: Different states handle it differently. Automatic weapons like AKs can be bought and it's a prominent point that it should just not be sold/legal to own altogether. You need a permit to buy a gun in some states. Buying guns at gun shows provides some loophole that makes it easier to get guns from them. There is some degree of background checks. 

I guess I know these broad things but I don't know specifics. And the specifics are what I would like to know. The specifics that are relevant to the current gun culture/danger/discourse in the US. Like, what IS the permit process? Is the permit process arguably too lax? Is it often unenforced? Are the background checks too lax? When people say they want stricter gun laws, what specific restrictions do they call for? (Aside from not being able to buy something like an AR-15) Do more of these shootings happen in states (per capita) where there are laxer gun laws?

I probably didn't cover everything relevant with my questions, so please feel free to inform me on whatever else is relevant that I wouldn't have thought to ask about.


Edit: Instead of automatic, meant to refer to stuff like on the level of an AR-15.","Here's a quick overview:

Federally, the NFA or national firearm act was passed in the 30's. It explicitly forbids the manufacturing or selling of automatic firearms without federal registration. If you want an automatic firearm (which are extremely expensive and rare) you have to submit a lot of paperwork to the atf, pay a fee, and wait for approval. 

The NFA also covers rifles with barrels under 16 inches, shotguns with a barrel under 18 inches, and silencers. These all have to have paperwork submitted to the atf before you can actually take one home. These are tracked federally, and cannot be taken across state lines without notifying the atf. 

Federally, everytime a firearm is sold (from a retailer or some form of business) they have to run a background check. If you've committed a felony, were recently in some sort of mental institution or were involuntary committed, were dishonorably discharged from the military, or some other specific reason, you are forbidden from owning a firearm.  This background check system is referred to as the NICS, and is maintained by the FBI. 

On the state level, some states have more requirements for firearm ownership, others have the federal minimum and that's it. It varies wildly by state. Some states, like Illinois, require each and every firearm owner to have a license, which is processed and approved (or denied) by the state policy. Others, like Texas, have no restrictions. 

What's often talked about is the lack of state and federal laws regarding person to person sales (aka the loophole, except it isn't). Some states, like Illinois, require the sale to be logged with the state, and a file to kept for 10 years. Others, like a big chunk of the south and southwest, have no requirement, making it legally like selling a lawnmower or some other item. 

State laws vary wildy, and this is a very general overview."
407,"Hello everyone,

I apologize if this is the wrong place to ask this question. If it is the wrong sub, I'll gladly take this post down.

I am currently working on writing a paper about mandatory voting for a class of mine, and I wanted to include examples of low voter turnout causing useful legislation to fail. It's difficult to find stuff like this online as I'm not even sure what to search for. Therefore, my question is whether or not anyone knows about any such happenings or any resources that aggregate data such as this.

Thank you!","Voters don't vote for legislation. Legislators do.

The closest could be a ballot measure? But elections can't ""lose"" due to low voter turnout. There always a winner. Even if only a single voter showed up, whichever way that voter votes would win."
408,"First time poster.

So I've been thinking of switching jobs for a while and getting involved in politics.  I think this is a good idea, as do most of my friends and family, not in terms of having political viewpoints, but in terms of learning and understanding the subject.

I'm that weird guy who studies electoral history, political messaging, polling, the economics of campaign management: stuff like that.  I've taken several classes in public policy.  You'd never *want* me to be a politician (I'm not that good at seeming likable or charismatic) but I feel like I could be quite good at potentially being a David Axelrod or Karl Rove type, or working for either the RNC/DNC some day.

The problem is that in the past I've been told repeatedly ""If you're into politics, find some campaign and work for them on the ground and work your way up"", and when I go to local campaigns I've always felt like I'm just a wasted volunteer and that I ""don't seem that passionate"" (which I'm not!).  I don't want to be that person who ""makes a difference"" or really believes in either Democrat or Republican ideology: I want to be one of the staffers in the backroom who analyzes the data.

I have experience in statistics and economics, and I don't mind starting as an intern or something, and I wouldn't even mind moving locations, but if I wanted to pursue this sort of thing, where would I go and how would I go about it?  I really don't have any particular political leanings, but I feel like I'd be both passionate and good at such a job and I'm kind of frustrated with the idea that the only way into politics as a career requires having strong political biases.","A few thoughts on this.

First off, are you still a student?  If so, I'd recommend finding a polisci professor and talking with her about this.

That said, it sounds like you don't have a *degree* in economics, statistics, political science, etc.  Correct?  I don't know if this is a deal-breaker for certain organizations or not.

On to partisan politics: they're right.  You have to pick a party.  You mentioned Rove and Axelrod; their pinnacle achievements were winning presidential campaigns, but you don't get to run presidential  campaigns unless you have a demonstrated lifelong commitment to one party or the other.  Like it or not, a lot of party insiders are really true believers, and they just won't trust a ""I don't really identify with either side"" type.  It's ultimately a team sport, and you have to pick a team, and there are always going to be people who really do want to be there who will look better than you . . .

. . . unless you want to go pure data science/analysis/polling.  There are respected non-partisan polling institutes, and analysis type news publications (think FiveThirtyEight).  I know less about them, but your potential lack of a specific degree might hurt---but again, if you're a student, try interning.  They might just post job openings for their organizations, for all I know.

My instinct is to disagree with this, but I have no expertise. I could be wrong. My understanding is that our public opinions, via our elected representatives, do have bearing on the decisions of lawmakers, but not on the courts. That's why judges are appointed. They do not represent constituents, but rather are tasked with making unilateral decisions regarding the meaning and application of the laws that have already been written, as well as whether or not those laws are in accord with the Constitution.

Am I missing something?

415,"If the Electoral College were to tie or otherwise no candidate received 270 votes, a contingent election is held in the House for the President and in the Senate for the Vice President. If a contingent election happened and the Senate were 50/50, what would happen? Could an incumbent Vice President cast a tie-breaking vote to retain their position, or would the vote just fail?","So this would come from the 12th amendment, relevant section quoted below:

>The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed, and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice.

So reading says, with 2/3 of the number of senators (so 67 of 100 senators if all senators are available), each senator get a vote and whoever gets a majority of the votes wins. Votes may only be cast for the two candidates with the highest electoral votes.

If the Senate is deadlocked in a tie, a plain reading of the text (specifically the text ""... two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary"") implies that only the Senators may vote on the Vice President, and the sitting VP is not able to cast a vote. The Senate could continue to debate and continue casting votes as they see fit. Any failure to nominate a VP would result in the office becoming vacant after inauguration.

Now obviously this is untested, and we've never had this situation come about in recent history, nor have we have any significant cases related to the 12th amendment on this issue. So it's possible the courts could rule the sitting VP does get a vote, but reading the amendment seems to imply only Senators get to vote."
416,"Is it because it is a nation in transition towards a communist goal?

- They are a capitalist powerhouse.
- they use fear and control.
- Their welfare state is much lower than other capitalist countries (per capita).
- From what we see, workers have no power. Like in nazi Germany, labour unions are controlled by the state? Shouldn’t a communist state guard workers rights for the benefit of workers rather than for the benefit of the state/industry?

It’s confusing because they idolise Marx, but are one of the biggest capitalist economies in the world.

Edit:

Communism - socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common or social ownership of all property, including the means of production.

China on social ownership/power - Independent labor unions are illegal in China. The government only endorses one union, known as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). All other unions fall under their hierarchical control. Since ACFTU is tied to the government, it prioritizes government stability. The government partially owns the largest firms. There are over 100 billionaires in the country.

417,"The recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the west's ever growing list of economic sanctions against Russia started me thinking about sanctions and their effectiveness.  

The main argument goes if Nation A is doing something Nation B doesn't like, Nation B applies sanctions to Nation A to get Nation A to do what Nation B wants.  Usually, Nation B will be economically more powerful than Nation A, such that Nation B's sanctions against Nation A carries some real oomph.

There are many examples where the US has applied sanctions to other nations: Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, ect. but many times the end result isn't any of the nations on the receiving end of the sanctions changing their behavior or government in a way favorable to the US.  Iran, North Korea, and Cuba have all been under US sanctions for over 50 years, but the end result is these nations are still not doing what the US wants.

Could it be that sanctions as a tactic are just not very effective, but just considered a preferable alternative to armed conflict?  Or could it be they serve another purpose?  

Many nations on the receiving end of sanctions have their economic power and technological superiority sapped.  Take Cuba as an example.  Decades of US sanctions have taken their toll on Cuba, and nobody really considers it a viable threat anymore.  Could sanctions then not really be a way for one nation to try to control the behavior of another nation, but instead actually be a tool that slowly disempowers adversaries to the point they are no longer considered as much of a threat?  Or is this just a side effect of sanctions being used as an ineffective tactic?","Well, first off, you asked two separate questions:
What is the purpose of sanctions?
And are sanctions effective?
It seems you grasp well the purpose of them, they are a way to attempt to dissuade a country from doing things that don’t align with your interests, in a way that doesn’t threaten armed conflict. Now, as to wether they are effective, that’s much harder to say. See, you can’t prove a negative. You can’t say that without sanctions things would be the same as they are with sanctions, because we have no way of knowing. I happen to agree, however, that sanctions by themselves are not an effective strategy. Not only do they harm both countries equally, they also tend to harm the citizens of the countries way more than the rulers. Not to mention, it’s not like these countries we impose sanctions on just stop producing their goods. They can’t trade them with us, which hurts in the short term, but leads to them trading with other people, especially countries that are antagonistic towards those imposing the sanctions. This is what happened with Russia and Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis. The problem is, we currently don’t have a better way of punishing counties."
418,"I hear both sides saying this is on the government. Why?  They manufacture a very expensive product for what it is, BECAUSE they have to have a lot of QC as they are feeding infants. 

 I keep hearing how the government didn't come down on them hard enough earlier, but why TF when they got caught, were accused earlier and didn't fix it is that on the government and not the manufacturer?  Especially when so much of the nation's supply is coming out of that one plant? 

Are we so far gone that we will find it acceptable to sicken or kill a few babies if it means a company can hit it's quarterly goals, the only reason to not do that is if government regulators come down on them?  Yet so many people are complaining about government getting in the way.

And I'll get on my soapbox and say that other than the cost of the downtime and cleaning, it won't harm the company.   They have like 60% of the market, no one is coming in and competing with them even though lots of people will be yelling capitalism will take care of this.","The baby formula issue is manufactured outrage. It isn’t actually meant to address the crux of the problem, which isn’t really the government’s fault. Technically without the NAFTA renegotiation we could just import more baby formula but that would require criticizing the Trump administration, so it’s not surprising the Republican tactic is to divert and distract by scapegoating immigrants and refugees instead."
419,"Anti-police sentiment has grown in the US. Usually, this takes the form of simply protesting abuse of police power, calling to partially defund police/redirect funds elsewhere, create additional oversight, etc. But there are plenty of not-that-small leftist movements that seem to characterize their opposition to law enforcement much more overtly: phrases like ACAB (all cops are bastards), MDC (millions of dead cops), ""No such thing as a good cop,"" etc. It comes across to me that their ideal government would have no law enforcement at all.

I assume that a lot of this rhetoric is thrown around in order to make a point. But I don't want to dismiss the idea too easily if there's something I haven't considered. So my most basic question here is: **Can you advocate for the abolition of all law enforcement without being an anarchist?** Or at least, can you do it rationally and consistently? And if so, how does it work?

I know in the US, there has been talk of replacing traditional police departments, at least in part, with social workers, community watch, etc. Is anyone advocating for a complete transition away from police? And if so, would it still count as abolishing law enforcement? If someone in a community has the power to stop others from breaking the law, isn't that still law enforcement? If no one has that power, then how can any government function at all?

Or is it really just rhetoric to voice how little trust they currently have in that particular institution, as it exists today? Is no one *actually* advocating for the nation to cease all law enforcement indefinitely?

I hope this doesn't come across as closed-minded or biased. I certainly have my opinions, but I'm completely sincere in asking this question. Thanks!","Police and Prison abolition is a well-articulated ideology held mostly by left-wing libertarians (including but not exclusively anarchists). I am not an expert but in general, from what I have read ""abolishing the police"" means replacing the police with some form of community protection system which would differ from the police in a few main ways

1. Be constituted by and fully and directly accountable to the people of the community. Mean people who participated in community protection would always be members of the community and their actions always be directly reported to the whole community and freely scrutinized. Force only ever be used as a last resort.
2. The purview of the community protection force (at least the part of it that might use force) is purely limited to violent incidents. Drug Use and Sex Work are completely decriminalized, and any law that targets marginalized people like sit-lie laws are taken off the books
3. This can only be fully achieved in the context of a broad transformation of the society away from one that values retributive over restorative justice.

423,"According to former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, when Trump was President, he discussed the idea of firing missiles at Mexican drug cartels' bases.

This did not happen.  But I have a few questions about the details of this scenario:

- Is firing missiles into a country's territory automatically an act of war against that country?  Would doing this put the US at war with Mexico?  Does it matter that they would be aimed at a criminal organization?
- Back in 1916 Pancho Villa [attacked New Mexico, possibly several times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa#Attack_on_New_Mexico) leading to a [US military expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa_Expedition) into Mexico.  Are the drug cartels' actions comparable to Villa's raids?  Could firing of missiles against drug cartels be considered, for purposes of international law, roughly equivalent to the Pancho Villa Expedition?
- The US is in a permanent War on Drugs.  Does that relate at all?  My thinking is that since we've declared war on drugs, then missile strikes (or other military operations) against drug cartel installations, in whatever nation they may be located, might automatically be authorized?
- Would it conceivably be possible for the Mexican government to agree to let the US Military attack the cartels?  Would it conceivably be possible for this kind of attack to be approved by the US and Mexican governments, but carried out in secret from the public (presumably to avoid outrage in Mexico that the government would permit a foreign country to launch weapons at populated targets on Mexican soil)?  Or would news organizations be able to use civilian radar / satellites / surveillance footage to quickly piece together why a bunch of drug cartel bases ""suddenly and inexplicably exploded""?","There are no hard rules as to what constitutes an act of war. Would it be possible for the Mexican government to agree to let the US military attack the cartels? Yes. In secret? Launching missles internationally in secret? Nope. Not going to happen. Very hard to hide. Also very hard to fabricate.

The biggest legal problem that this plan has is that it's questionable in the human rights department. Countries are not supposed to use the military to enforce the law, and especially not kill people for breaking the law. That's the job of civilian law enforcement and the courts."

Russian media is highly controlled by the government but isn't all directly administered by it. These aren't all from packaged edits from the Kremlin but from events put on by the Kremlin for media to gather their shots and repackage themselves. Not to say this is some subversive effort by that media (because it is again highly controlled) but the content is less gatekept.

A 'positive' interpretation is that any leader under almost constant spotlight will have unflattering footage of them, especially for a job that takes a lot out of you. Look at any US President in the modern media age - when you're under the camera lens basically non-stop, it's only human to catch a moment where you don't look well or speak incorrectly. The more negative interpretation is that this *is* the good content and that yes, he is actually very unwell and in an effort to bolster his image, they arranged these events to show his strength and this is the best they could do right now - better than letting people imagine him truly on his death bed or immobile.

My assumption is no because the entire conceit is the ""unborn child"" has the same rights as a ""born person"" but such a law would make the right to life of the ""unborn child"" have precedence over the right to life of the ""mother'","There are many states that have passed laws that would trigger if Roe is overturned that criminalize everthing to do with abortion. In Louisiana simply giving someone plan B makes you an accomplice to murder. By Louisiana's new definition even aborting an ectopic pregnancy is murder. A woman in texas was even recently arrested for a miscarriage. 

Total criminalization is coming to at least some states."
429,"Examples include Western countries asking North Korea and Iran to give up nuclear capability. The United States hasn't exactly been subtle about saying that these countries are evil, unreasonable, unpredictable, and run by maniacs, as evidenced by the term Axis of Evil. How do negotiations continue in good faith when the basis of the negotiation is one party saying the other is untrustworthy of having whatever is being asked to be given up? How do the negotiators avoid insulting the ""untrustworthy"" party since many people would end negotiations if called evil, unstable, or untrustworthy.","Diplomats don't negotiate with other countries, because countries aren't things you can negotiate with, any more than corporations are people (Citizens United notwithstanding) They negotiate with people who represent other countries, which seems like a pedantic distinction but it's the main point here. Diplomats strive to create good working relationships with their counterparts precisely so they can have meaningful negotiations regardless of what the latest political rhetoric might be. If you insult the individual, yes, that breaks down the relationship, but diplomats don't usually insult their counterparts. The equivalent of my country insulting yours is more similar to you being a die-hard Tigers fan and you hearing my dad insulting all things Detroit. It probably won't help our rapport but our relationship isn't gonna break down because of it.

Think of it like this: you and I are best friends but we only hang out at school because our parents hate each other. You and I can trust each other because we're in class, play on the same teams, etc. Etc. We know that our families aren't likely to budge on anything, so when we I need to use your dad's camera for a school project, we know we need to get your uncle (a neutral third party) to supervise. We can get past all the awful things our parents say about each other (and us) because of our individual relationships.

Now think of the same scenario but we don't share any classes, friends or hobbies. Doing anything productive is a lot harder as you probably won't give me the time of day, which is why diplomats spend so much time on relationship building, and why not having normalized relationships with the globe community is so difficult. 

We struggle to make progress with North Korea, Iran, etc. because we haven't built up the trust needed to make progress regardless of the situation. But even then, there are a few key people on both sides who know each other well enough to trust that when the US says they'll give food aid in exchange for prisoners, and they'll do it in a way that is hard for either side to back out, they'll work with us to get it done. You're just a lot less likely to work on time horizons or exchanges that aren't tit-for-tat if the diplomatic relationships aren't anything more than a cursory aquaintace."
430,"Women's reproductive rights (and potentially, other personal privacy rights such as same-sex and interracial marriage and contraception) appear to be shaping up to be political time bombs, similar to slavery during the 19th century.  The Dred Scott decision created the apparatus for slave holding states to effectively ""invade"" free states (under the guise of enforcing laws of the slave states that were not recognized by the free states). This in turn, led to the outbreak of civil war. Would a potential overturning of Roe have a similar effect, for similar reasons?","Not in the same way.  First of, as furious as I am about the decision, chattel slavery is way worse then banning abortion.  Also, so far, they haven't let red states enforce abortion bans outside of state lines, though the Texas abortion bounty law is also terrifying.  

But what's novel about this decision that, outside of criminal law, the courts haven't really eliminated rights.  They limit them all the time, but eliminating a right is new.  Even in criminal cases, they limit rights more than eliminating them.  

How this will play out remains to be seen, but the ""cold civil war"" thing is more relevant then ever with the 14th Amendment as a whole in jeopardy."
431,"Basically, their platform is more or less the same but there's more support for transit, affordable housing and infrastructure to help cities become nicer places to live? 

More broadly, how do you think they can build inroads in the cities? 

How much could it help them to build a better margin in the cities (like win 40% in cities and a similar proportion of council districts and state/congressional legislative districts in urban areas)? Wouldn't that shore them up in a ton of states especially in statewide races?","People don't vote on policies, they vote on rhetoric, and policies are, (in addition to being policies)  in a sense, a form of rhetoric. 

Everybody (in theory) wants ""cities to be more liveable"" right? Any Republican running in a city is going to run on a platform of making their city more liveable. But they are going to focus on different things. A republican will focus on crime, government bureaucracy, and lower taxes. Do people who live in cities not care about those things? Of course, they do, in fact, Democrats have run on those issues and won (see the current Mayors of New York and San Francisco)

But when Republicans run on those issues their rhetoric is, more often than not, heard as part of the border's decades-long strategy to use those issues as dog-whistles, for white suburbanites. The Republican Party has made itself the party of racial grievance, where crime is about pathologizing, blackness,  complaints about bureaucracy is about ""welfare queens"" and lower taxes almost never benefit the lower class. That has screwed urban Republicans running in liberal and diverse cities. Whether they intend those policies to be dog whistles or not, so long as they have an R next to their name that's how they will be heard."
432,"Does this mean every state will have to ban abortions ? Or will it be up the individual states to decide after that if it is overturned ? 

I think this whole thing is a load of BS. 
Main Reasoning: statistics show that 1 out of every 6 American woman has been the victim of an attempted or completed r**e in her lifetime. So when that person ends up becoming pregnant from this ordeal they are stuck with a baby they never asked for ? 

And what if that person doesn’t have the financial stability to take care of said child ? Are we just gonna keep crowding foster homes ? 

Seems like they are starting more problems by “fixing” one.","Overturning Roe v. Wade simply means that the Supreme Court is rejecting the notion that there is a constitutional right to abortion. This means that states will have the freedom to legislate their own abortion laws. In all likelihood, blue states will provide rigorous protections for the right to an abortion (as many already have under Roe) while red states will quickly regulate them, many even banning it outright or restricting access so much that it is effectively banned (e.g. Texas's ""heartbeat bill"" allows abortions only up until 6 weeks after conception when a fetal heartbeat can physically be detected, which is before most women even know they are pregnant). It is possible to pass abortion protections at the federal level, but this is unlikely given both the 50-50 split in the Senate as well as the existence of the filibuster.

I should add that, regardless of one's opinion on the morality of abortion, studies show that this will lead to more illegal abortions and/or women simply traveling from red states into blue states in order to receive one. This would cause both a disproportionate impact on poorer women and potentially overwhelm the clinics still operating in blue states."

I've read through the text ([full text](https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1276214)) and see no mention of IUD or contraceptives.  

How exactly would this bill ban either of those?","HB813 defines abortion as anything after the moment of fertilization (text here: [https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1276214](https://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1276214))   
How pregnancy works is, broadly, egg accepts sperm and starts dividing \[this is fertilization or conception\]. Not every zygote survives this process. If it does, some 5-18 days after fertilization the zygote tries to travel to the uterus and implant. Again, not every zygote is successful. Because somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of fertilized eggs never make it to implantation, and because the body doesn't even recognize there's a fertilized egg until it's implanted (you cannot even test positive for pregnancy until implantation), implantation is considered the start of pregnancy by the medical community. And an IUD works by making it difficult for a sperm to reach an egg, and a fertilized egg to implant. So if you're going by HB813's definition, IUDs are aborting unborn children."

Is there something mandating that one type of office must be like that but another office does not?

>On Dec 14, 1967, single-member House districts were mandated by law (2 U.S. Code §2c), under the justification that they served as bulwarks against southern Democrats diluting the electoral power of African Americans by using strategically drawn at-large multi-member districts (they could, for instance, create a single statewide multi-member district elected by plurality vote, all but guaranteeing the white majority would elect all Democrats[4]).[3]

I couldn't find a single article or source discussing the *motive*, and the political context surrounding it.
 I'm not interested as much in who ordered it, or who carried it out.","Yuschenko was poisoned during his campaign for the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. His main rival for the presidency was Viktor Yanukovych, the notoriously corrupt incumbent from the pro-Russian Party of Regions. Russia was undoubtedly trying to sabotage the election. 

In fact, Yanukovych at first appeared to have won re-election, but Ukraine’s Supreme Court found a massive amount of interference and fraud and ordered a second round of voting with safeguards in place, resulting in Yushchenko’s victory. Yuschenko’s poisoning was only the most egregious part of this wider campaign of election interference."
439,"The draft Supreme Court opinion was just leaked / shared; Roe and Casey will likely be reversed.  What is stopping the current Democratically controlled Congress (the Senate is split 50-50, but VP Harris could cast a tie breaking vote) from passing a federal law protecting abortion patients and abortion providers?  Actually, what stopped Congress from ever passing a law such as this in the past 49 years?","Two parts to it:

* Filibuster: practically speaking, they'd actually need to get 60 votes in support to get past the filibuster. Functionally (and a bit circuitiously) they could vote to get rid of the filibuster with a simple majority - but that would require literally every Democrat on board - and both Manchin and Sinema have said repeatedly that they will not vote to get rid of the filibuster.
* But even if they did, they would need all 50 votes to actually pass it, which again, Manchin has already gone on record saying he wouldn't do - and to be honest, it would likely put many Democratic Senators even in a tough spot. That being said, it would also put some Republicans in a tough spot from states where support for Roe v Wade is relatively high (e.g. Collins).

And what's stopped it from happening before, well similar dynamics to the above and some convenient side stepping of the issue. Congress doesn't actually work on simple majorities (or rather the Senate specifically doesn't) as it stands now. So as much as people claim trifectas, having a majority in the Senate actually doesn't allow you to do much on your own (it does however allow you to prevent a lot, which is still hugely important). And a lot of Reps and Senators would have preferred this to be a non-issue. As much as the GOP nationally makes a big fuss of it, and Dems nationally make a fuss of defending it, there are a fair number of vulnerable members on both sides who have constituencies that would react strongly to action from either of them. The beauty of Roe v Wade being 'settled law' from the Courts and outside of their jurisdiction was that they didn't need to push the issue - it was 'settled law'. Much like how you still even see many GOP Reps and Senators who don't want to support same sex marriage but also don't have to oppose it because it's 'settled'."
440,"As a response to the Supreme Court’s Inevitable overturning of Roe v. Wade, Democratic Senators are pushing to codify abortion protections. Regardless of its political feasibility, wouldn’t this just be a stop gap measure at best? If they enshrine a woman’s right to choose in any way other than a constitutional amendment, wouldn’t a challenge to the new federal statute be just as inevitable; and would not the Supreme Court (as it is currently configured) just rule it unconstitutional again once it reaches them?","Yes and no.  The recent opinion attacks the Constitutional basis for a right to abortion.  A federal law provides an independent basis for such a right, unless the opponents of the law can show that the way it's written would run afoul of some other Constitutional principle.  Which is not likely to be the case here.

The bigger problem is that Congress can always pass a law invalidating an earlier law.  Depending on who has the majority, an abortion law might last for decades, or months.  It would be an incredible political football with no real stability, which is the main benefit of Roe and Casey (such as they were.)"
441,"Let's say Roe v. Wade is officially overturned. Could Biden say ""then let them enforce it"", and continue to allow abortion to be federally legal?

442,"For example, in 2000, the Democrat establishment was not particularly in favor of same-sex marriage. Similarly, there still were plenty of pro-life Democrats.

The idea that a man could become a woman and vice versa by simply claiming their preferred gender would have laughed anyone out of a room, regardless of which party's members filled said room. What changed?","Your question seems to be implying that the current social positions of the Democratic Party (transgender rights, gay marriage, pro-choice, etc) are far-left, radical even. Your use of the word ""woke"" suggests that you are right-wing (progressives stopped using ""woke"" years ago).

Democrats moved somewhat to the left gradually because of three factors:

Society's growing acceptance of people that didn't conform to traditional expectations of identity,

Political polarization over the last 6 decades,

443,"We have an election later this month in Australia and [we recently had a far-right political party publish a video accusing a centre-left political party of planning voter fraud](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-04-29/aec-warns-pauline-hanson-one-nation-over-voter-fraud-video/101026812).

But what criteria have to be filled for an election to be seen as trustworthy? I've never heard of UN electoral observers being sent to Australia, and I previously assumed that it's because they see our election system as highly trustworthy. Previous Australian elections haven't been marred by accusations of voter fraud, but now that the cat is out of the bag, would Australia need to let in UN electoral observers to convince the world that our elections aren't fraudulent, or are there other ways Australia can prove to the world that our elections are trustworthy?

On a side note, could countries reject Australia's election result because of, for example, our lobbying problem, or [our low Gallagher index score](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/u6tew6/we_need_to_seriously_consider_electoral_reform_in/)?","There are some objective markers of ""free and fair"" elections and they tend to be pretty obvious things like can an opposition candidate run, who does the vote counting and how, is turnout weirdly high and one-sided, etc.

There are other measures that different evaluation systems will use that are more specific to those organizations.

On a broad level, the vast majority of what makes elections trustworthy is do people genuinely trust them to deliver a fair result (note, not the result they *want*.) If they do, that tends to be the biggest indicator.

There are always going to be people who think any election that doesn't go the way they want it to wasn't fair and if they can produce actual, credible evidence of chicanery that goes beyond simple incompetence or localized mischief making then there's a discussion to be had. If all they can do is point to smoke and mirrors as evidence, they're probably not worth being given attention.

Australia, as far as I'm aware, doesn't *have* to let the UN in to monitor their elections though requesting UN monitoring may be a way to shore up confidence in an election (unless the goal is to cast doubt over the election regardless of what happens) or to defray concerns about there being problems."

452,"I have seen the claim that the West is trying to export their culture and see it as superior to other cultures of the world, and I believe this is nonsense.

The west is **TERRIFIED of criticizing non-western cultures.** If you look at a western media criticizing white homophobes or sexist it goes very hard, but when news about something like middle eastern homophobia and sexism appears...it goes completely quite, with a tiny article vaguely to avoid engaging in imperialism...because criticizing cultures you are not from is seen a cultural imperialism.

Their imperialism is ONLY from an economic standpoint - the pretend to support LGBT and women's rights, but it is not **sincere** in any way, shape or form.

This pisses me off, as I am looking for an ideology to enforce LGBT and women rights, and am always told Neoliberalism does this, which is simply **NOT TRUE**.","There’s no singular monolithic ideology to the economic process of neoliberalism. It’s obvious to anybody who’s not inside a partisan bubble that there is an ideological ecosystem with multiple poles. These also correspond with multiple sections of the capital class and sincere differences of opinion within that class. 

The part of capital which relies on the import of raw materials will have a strong incentive to promote the underdevelopment of whereever they import from. On the other hand people who see underdeveloped places as potential markets for manufactured goods will want to promote modernization (and therefore westernization) so that products can be marketed there. The more westernized the more easily a place can be integrated into the capitalist world system. 

If you follow the actual communications on the governmental level, the west really isn’t nearly as shy as you think about criticizing non-western places. It’s exactly because of this that there’s a section within the media ideological ecosystem that is dedicated to criticizing such ‘cultural imperialism’. The bigger factor is that you as an American or Canadian just does not see that much reporting about places outside your own country. It’s just not that interesting to most people, and most news agencies do not put money into covering international affairs except when it directly implicates American national interests.  Even a lot of stories that are of American interest, like US military involvement across Africa are hardly covered at all for the pretty simple reason that Americans don’t care and it’s more expensive to cover. 

The basic process is that capitalism overall wants places to expand to new places, as this is easier the more like us they are. However they don’t need to be exactly like us, just willing to morph in certain ways. Overall systems of ‘universalism’ will be the most market compatible, so that stands as a sort of pole a market system moves towards, but the market system can still work under severe deformations to universalism so will resist pushing a non market society if it risks triggering an anti-market reaction. 

I’d strongly recommend you check out the book Introduction to World Systems Analysis by Emmanuel Wallerstein. That is a book all about the relationship between the Core (west) and Periphery (Non-western) nations within the Capitalist World-System, and gets into things like the ideological ecosystem of the west as containing the three polls of conservative, liberal, and radical left in an ever evolving web, as well as the role of ‘special interest groups’ (as he calls them) in both core and periphery. 

I don’t think I’ve done a great job summarizing his points, but I feel like that book and world-systems thinking in general would really help you see the points you are making from a much wider scope. You are getting at a bunch of things that are all true phenomena buts it’s just not all fitting together and that’s frustrating, something like world-systems zooms out far enough to see that your own vantage point was creating blind spots."
453,"From my understanding, one federal judge cannot overrule another. So if a president is worried that an executive order will be struck down in a federal court, could he have someone either  indirectly or directly bring a case against it in a federal court he knows slants in his favor (providing they are able to provide standing)? Is this a way that the executive order couldn’t be struck down in a different court?","The executive branch has no authority over the judicial branch. The president can't control which judge will take his case. Or at least, that's the idea. It would take either some real Deep State kinda nonsense for that to happen, or our judicial system would no longer be independent and our democracy would more or less be dead.

The only way this could be a real strategic choice is if the president brought the suit in a circuit court that was known to be a bit more friendly to the president's perspective, but even then that circuit court could still be overruled by the SCOTUS. If there truly was something like this going on, where a VERY suspect ruling went down at the circuit level, the SCOTUS would very likely take the case just to clear up any concerns about judicial impartiality."

455,"Hi all,  

  

I'm writing a paper for one of my final Master's courses this year (Philosophy of Law), and in doing some readings I came across the notion of an ""entrapped nation,"" and yet I can't seem to find any other mention of it, in the literature, aside from the one place I noticed it — I'm wondering, then, if anybody has any information on the concept, or can direct me to some writings on it? I'm hoping to use the concept in my paper, yet if I can't find anything to support it or further elaborate on it, I'll have to drop it.  

  

I first found mention of it in \*The Quest for Justice: Aboriginal Peoples and Aboriginal Rights\* which was edited by Boldt and Long, and published in 1985 by the University of Toronto Press. At any rate, mention of the above concept comes from Ahenakew's chapter (""Aboriginal Title and Aboriginal Rights: The Impossible and Unnecessary Task of Identification and Definition""), wherein he writes that:  

""Currently, a United Nations working group is engaged in a five-year plan to draft an international convention regarding the rights of the 'entrapped nations' - indigenous peoples encircled by a dominant government not of their own making."" (pp. 28)  

  

So, my questions are what was mentioned above; i.e., does anyone know of any further writings on this topic? In particular, does anyone know of the United Nations convention mentioned, and if anything arose from it?

propose that NATO's tone-deaf policies towards Russia and it's expansion eastwards is what pushed the current Ukraine situation to crisis.  

However, there is also a counter-narrative that NATO in its current form cannot be a threat to Russia.  It is a defensive alliance with no offensive capaibilites.  It has no interests in attacking Russia.  And prior to the invasion the budgets were being cut and NATO members were drifting apart from each other.  The real reason Putin invaded is because he wants to re-create the old soviet sphere of influence, and this would've happened even if NATO did not expand.  

I find both sides well articulated, but wondering if anyone with good geopolitical or historical context can shed light on which one is more right?","The War Crime of Aggression, of invading another country and wantonly killing civilians, is always entirely the fault of the aggressor. If I murder somebody, arguing I had to do it because they might have entered into a defensive pact with their neighbors is ridiculous.

Maybe there were things the West could have done better, sure. Russian public opinion towards the West did sour when NATO began to be expanded — but back in 2001 Russia was absolutely willing to partner with NATO in the aftermath of 9-11 and treat NATO as an ally, not a threat.

Putin just grew worse and worse, more paranoid, more cruel, more draconian, the longer he was in power. Power does that to some people. The West gave him many chances to fix the relationship. In retrospect, I don’t think we could have prevented Putin becoming what he has become.

If we want to look at something the West could have done better, I’d look at the Yeltsin years and our involvement in the Loans-for-Shares program, where Russian state assets were rapidly sold off in a program of then fashionable economic “shock therapy.” Gangsters bought up the bulk of Russian capital and the oligarch class was born, creating the ecosystem that enabled Putin’s rise to power.

Instead of shock therapy we should have done something like a Marshall plan for Russia."
459,And how do they compare to the policies of the Republican Party in the US?,"I's say he might fit better as either the all-but-gone far left side of the Republican party or the rightward side of the Democratic one.

460,"Media in the US talks a lot about Russia propaganda. As they present it, Russia has a sophisticated propaganda machine that seems to be central to the regime's legitimacy and it's strategy Ukraine both domestically and internationally. The Russians can't be the only ones fighting a war of information, but I have found it difficult to understand how the Americans (or NATO allies in general) approach this outside of political speeches rebuking propaganda and so on. How are Americans et al. spreading their own narratives of the Ukrainian War in Russia? Are they trying to penetrate Putin's control of information within Russia, perhaps trying to highlight war crimes or the war's human toll to undermine popular support for the war? Does anyone have any resources for understanding what the US is doing to challenge the war domestically in Russia? 

I understand that much of this info may not be public, and I would appreciate perspectives from outside the US too.","The thing about propaganda is that it doesn't have to be untruthful at all- the root word is the same as to propagate.

461,"Hey y'all I'm currently taking an course over Environmental Law. I'm constantly hearing the phrase ""science-based decision-making"" and how certain administrations in the U.S. will sometimes increase or decrease the amount of science-based decision-making on environmental acts such as the Endangered Species Act or other such things. 

This had me thinking, how much on average do we use this type of decision making for everything as a whole? Not just environmental. Maybe somebody could give me a percentage? In our course we're not really even told how much we use this type of thinking, just that science typically has less bias as opposed to business people or environmentalists when it comes to decision making. 

My apologies if I'm a bit clueless on how laws, policies etc are made.

**Edit:** Alright so this ask is getting quite a few answers that kinda scare me, though I'm not surprised because I can absolutely believe em when it comes to the grand scope of politics. To those saying that we hardly use science when making decisions do you mind providing a few sources for that? Again I believe yall, but the more... lowkey reason I made this ask was because I wanted to discuss it with other people and it's hard to do so without any sites on hand that brings a point across. You don't need to or anything but it would be nice if you could.

Thank y'all for answering ♥","If you're asking about Congress passing legislation, the answer is very little science-based decision making happens for a lot of things.  Congress may commission studies and have subcommittees research into things, but at the end of the day, politicians gonna politic.

The good news is that for much environmental legislation (and many other laws implemented by administrative agencies) they pass the buck right along to the people in those agencies whose job it is to make the laws work.  The federal law passed by Congress will establish an agency and give it the power to make regulations over clean air or transportation or whatever.

And those people, doing the actual dirty work, are often scientists or other experts in the field."

Even then, it is difficult as you need to define what an educated voter is. Are we considering college educated, only? What about trade schools? Advanced graduate degrees only?

Generally, even educated conservatives are still conservative—albeit, the group as a whole may have more refined views. For example, I oppose CRT as the junior high and lower level, but I’m fine with it being taught as one of many theories/schools of though along with other controversial schools of thought. I recall even being taught stuff like Feminist and Marxist schools of historical interpretation back in undergrad history class. 

On the other hand, my abortion view—by way of example—is probably even more conservative than the conservative voting populace as a whole."

464,"North Korea seems to be a living political relic. It is without doubt  one of, if not the most sealed of dictatorships in the modern world.  Decades of drastic sanctions don't seem to have changed much about that  and a revolution is nowhere in sight. What is going to happen with this  anachronous autocracy, holding its own citizens hostage? For how long can it continue to exist like that? How will it cease to exist and what  will it look like afterwards?","The People's Democratic Republic of Korea (as the kids say) is a hereditary dictatorship - unlike some other regimes, transfers of power are orderly and have, as of yet, not been by coup. Successors are chosen and then lionized for the role in state media, preparing their legitimacy for when they take the throne. This stability is more common to absolute monarchies and other family regimes, where elites need not worry as much when the leader dies. Elites are more likely to remain in power supporting the family successor, and vise versa.

This being said, the DPRK does show signs of regime weakness. According to witnesses and footage smuggled out of the country, people have shown a increased willingness to be defiant about accusations from the police/military, so long as the offenses aren't political crimes. Foreign media continues to be snuggled into the ""hermit kingdom"" on DVDs and flash drives, and those who can afford it have quite the appetite for Western TV shows.

Perhaps the biggest threat North Korea faces is its dependence on its neighbors. Ironically for a state dedicated to Juche (self-reliance), the DPRK's economy is propped up by China. For now, China is willing to provide food and energy assistance to its totalitarian beneficiary because it fears sharing a border with a unified Korea (or should I say, a unified Korea under US influence). But should China's interests change, and the supplies stop flowing, the Kim Dynasty could unravel quickly. North Korea has almost always had food shortages, and the possibility of a second devastating famine lingers."
465,Has anybody heard or know anything about Putins current  health ? There are rumors and stories going around that he is ill and maybe fatally . Can anyone add anything to this ?,"Of course there are rumors. If you were at war with someone, you'd spread all kinds of rumors to destabilize their power base. I'm sure the west is responsible for some of these rumors and I'm sure some are true. We'll know in 10 years, or when he drops dead.

Best to not put too much stock in rumors."
466,"I'm curious, what is the purpose of using a proportional system for the Democratic primaries? Wouldn't a popular vote be easier and more straightforward? What is the point?","Great question. The modern concept of a popular primary was invented only very recently--after the 1970 Kent State riot outside of DNC headquarters. Up to that point, the parties nominated candidates based on input almost entirely from party insiders. The nomination process was not transparent and voters had no direct input, and with LBJ not running and the DNC in a period of significant transition (they had only just recently purged the party of Southern conservatives and then their most popular leaders were either shot dead or stepping away, creating both a need for strong leadership and a power vacuum), Dem voters were fed up with this process, leading to the riots. This sentiment was vindicated when the ""backroom deals in smoke filled rooms"" selected party elite Hubert Humphrey, who then lost in a not-all-that-close election to a candidate JFK already beat just a few years ago. The fact that Nixon completely redesigned his political platform and may as well have been a different candidate was overlooked at the time.

So the Dems solved this problem with a reform measure to create primaries. McGovern and Fraser formed the McGovern-Fraser Commission and proposed the format for what would later become the very first primary structure. Under the McGovern-Fraser rules, party leaders were sidelined almost entirely. Each state ran a selection and whoever had the most support at the end of the selection period won the nomination.

Delegates are used because especially when the selection season is months long, it's a lot easier to use a proxy measurement that's in the scale of hundreds than in the scale of tens of millions. Think about it this way. There are 25 states done 25 left to go. One guy has a lead of 10 million votes. How much of a lead is that? Is it a lot? Can it be made up? Can you imagine, especially for voters, trying to figure out the state of the race and having to add up the eligible voter population among Dems in each of the remaining states? It would be completely inaccessible.

So instead, McGovern and Fraser proposed delegates. The delegates to each state are proportionally assigned--CA has the highest population of eligible voters, so it has the highest number of delegates. NH has less voters so it has less delegates. And so on. Now, ordinary voters can have investment in the process without having to do math that measures in millions.

The early results showed some promise. Voters seemed to be alright with the new system. McGovern left the commission in 1971 to run for president. He won...and then got absolutely destroyed in historic fashion. The next candidate selected by the process was Jimmy Carter. Carter fared better in the general election, but keep in mind that was the first election post-Watergate. William Jennings Bryan could have run and won. But once the Reps had a chance to move past the Watergate legacy, Carter fared much less well and lost in almost historic fashion against Reagan.

So as you can see, while the McGovern-Fraser rules were a step forward for the process, the early returns revealed that the process tended to reward highly ideological candidates that played well to the base but didn't compete well in a national election. McGovern and Carter both were utterly destroyed, and looking to the future, Mondale couldn't break the mold either. Something needed to be done.

Enter the Hunt Commission. The Hunt Commission convened in 1980 with the intent of fixing the process started with McGovern-Fraser and it created the process we used up until 2020. Hunt introduced one key change: superdelegates. The concept was that as important as voters are, voters have trouble thinking at the larger picture of effective campaign strategy, and that's where party leaders can help improve the process. Superdelegates were a way for party leaders to be able to weigh in directly for a portion of the process, hopefully electing someone much more effective nationally than the voter base was currently allowing.

Early returns for this process were much better. Sure, you still had Mondale win in 1984, but the process was still figuring out and he was clearly associated with the old Carter administration selected before Hunt. After Mondale, Dukakis was a much better candidate. He still wasn't particularly close, but his support was at least built across various constituencies in a way Carter and Mondale's wasn't. He showed the proof of concept by carrying states in the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Pacific Northwest, even if the Dems still had a lot of work to do.

Hunt further proved its effectiveness by continuing onward with Clinton, the first Dem president to win in a real, non-Watergate election since 1964. Clinton was the true nationally effective candidate that McGovern-Fraser couldn't seem to find, and he was followed by more of the same. Al Gore actually won the popular vote. Kerry lost, but it wasn't a tremendous blowout, and it was against a popular incumbent after 9/1\`1, so hard to get too bent out of shape there. He was followed by Obama, who was obviously an excellent candidate, then Clinton, who like Gore only barely lost, and then Biden, who actually won.

Before the 2020 election, one more reform was made. Starting in the Obama nomination years, voters started to get very concerned about superdelegates overturning the will of the voters. Of course, this has never happened, and since the introduction of superdelegates the candidates have been objectively far superior. Nonetheless, voters grew concerned that in a highly divisive field, superdelegates had a bad influence on the process, particularly as Sanders and Clinton had a very divisive battle in 2016. And so before 2020, superdelegates were reformed to automatically confirming the results of the regular delegates except in cases of a contested convention where no one reaches a majority.

EDIT: Quick correction. Kent State was in 1970 and was an anti-war protest, not a riot demanding increased representative democracy. The event I was thinking of was the 1968 DNC nomination riots. Thanks to u/cincyblog for correcting me."

469,"Let me expand on this question.

Preface: I have a few friends that I talk with weekly about anything and everything. There is a wide political spectrum. Sometimes, when we talk about China and US relations, I get told that, ""China owns most us debt, they just have to call it in, and we would be ruined (or add some consequence here)"".

Things I would like to know: 

From my searches, I see that the common answer is that  \~15% or over a trillion of our debt is owned by China (treasury-related and consumer?). I don't know if I'm searching with the right keywords, or if I didn't asses the claim correctly. Any insight on this is appreciated.

""They just have to call it in."" - I suspect that it's a simplification of a repayment process. Some insight on this is also appreciated, I'm not too familiar with financial products. My financial knowledge only goes as a far as personal issues. 

What is the actual reality of the situation?","Most is owed to ourselves (US citizens) through mutual funds and Social Security administration purchases. Just googled this article that appears to have decent information on the topic. [https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124](https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124) 

As far as foreign governments holding our debt, China is the second largest behind Japan. Typically this is in the form of US treasury bonds, and maybe someone else can chime it that knows more about it, but I know they have different maturity dates and I'm not sure they can recall the money prior to their maturity date or not. The time frames are anywhere from 4 weeks to 30 years on treasury bonds, and I imagine governments would be parking their assets in longer term bonds than the shorter term ones."
470,"In this particular case, I'm not talking so much about misconceptions regarding specific policies or ideologies, but on the political system itself. Think stuff like voting behaviour, balance of power, political party operations and so on.

I ask because most political discussion I tend to see on Reddit (not usually in this subreddit) tends to come across as oddly misleading or simplified, regardless of which subreddit it's from and whether I agree or not. Trying to find relevent infor is surprisingly hard - almost everything I've come across is either pre-Trump, about fake news websites or focused on a particular group (e.g. alt-right, Bernie supporters).","Probably that the President has all the power to improve the economy.  Realistically no President should ever run for re-election by saying they fixed the economy in their first term, since their general economic impact isn't really felt until after the mid term period of their second term.  For example Trump's good economy in his first two years was really just the wake of Obama.  This was the same story with W. Bush and Clinton."
471,"The US and multiple other nations have begun supplying, essentially donating, various types of arms to Ukraine.

Obviously Russia can't be happy with this, but why doesn't it come up in discussions as explicit support for Ukraine and in a sense, as joining the war against Russia? It's a crystal clear contribution to the fight and an indicator of a growing alliance.

I can understand financial aid being different, especially if justified as humanitarian aid or something. I can also understand selling weapons to some degree, ie. business is business.

The Kremlin whines about every little ""atrocity"" against them. Clearly, supplying US/NATO troops would be seen as a declaration of war, but why wouldn't Russia consider the supply of weapons to their enemies a direct attack?

Does the degree of weapon effectiveness matter? eg. the Slovakian missile swap. If the US had donated the Patriot missile system to Ukraine instead of them receiving S-300, would that have been any different than supplying javelins, small arms, etc?

EDIT: Am I wrong in my assumption that weaponry is being ""donated""? Even so, billions of dollars are now are being donated. From NPR 'The money is divided between what lawmakers term ""lethal"" and ""humanitarian"" aid.'","Sometimes it is deemed an act of war, or at least an act of hostility.  Sometimes nations respond by attacking the shipping that's transferring the weapons (even sinking ships on the open seas at times).  

Generally speaking, it makes sense to distinguish between a direct attack, and an indirect attack.  Supplying weapons is an indirect attack.  During the Cold War, the US and the Soviets both had an extensive history of supplying weapons to groups the other side was fighting; while never having their own troops engage in direct conflicts with the other side.  Proxy wars, as they are called, were quite common.  Most likely Russia isn't complaining because they simply view it as another proxy war; and also because they don't want other nations to intervene more directly.  Russia knows it can't afford to pick a fight with more nations, so they choose not to take any directly offensive action to counter the flow of arms into Ukraine."

473,"I was reading an American Union’s [medium article](https://phoenixcongress.medium.com/we-must-reform-our-prisons-to-heal-our-nation-b672dc2bddb4) on prison and criminal justice reform and had this question pop up for me as I was reading it. It briefly mentioned how our current criminal justice system are effectively ripping families apart, contributing to a cycle of incarceration of millions of people in the United States. What other effects of this incarceration do you know often gets overlooked in the conversation about criminal justice reform?","I don't know exactly what to call it, but basically the negative feedback loop of people in the system, but outside of it. I'll explain:

First, we have to look at the two key pressures which create this problem. The first player is the special interest groups: The people who offer counselling, drug testing, monitoring, rehab, etc... All these industries benefit for stronger and more ""treatment"" and monitoring. Second, the politicians. They look at adding more ""programs"" or different types of punishment for failure, as helping the individual. 

Let me give you two scenarios I saw CONSTANTLY with people right on the edges of the system and how it completely destroyed their lives because they lacked the means. 

1) Normal guy, living a normal lower middle class life, paycheck to paycheck, like many Americans. One day he does something stupid and gets a bunch of traffic tickets, one of which was reckless driving which gives the officer the option to tow your car. He doesn't have to, but if he's feeling extra grumpy that day he can.

Well tows are REALLY expensive to get your car out, and every day the cost just compounds. So he's unable to get his car out, at the same time, he loses his job because you know, he can't get to work. So he loses what little he had, but his mother has a crappy old RV junker (which is more than most people could be offered), and takes that and lives in that. (She lives in a retirement home)

This is just enough to scrape by and get another job while he lives in an RV (Again, most poor people don't even have this opportunity. He's more privileged than most people in the trap)

One day he gets cops randomly doing a ""wellness check"" on the guy since living in your RV is illegal in the city. So they arrest him, only to find out he hasn't paid those tickets that originally got him in this mess, so they send him to jail where you spend 1 day per 100 dollars, so he's locked for 2 weeks. Of course, he loses his job again, and when he returns, his RV has been towed and not only can he not afford to get it out, but he never even finds out who the hell towed it. 

So when he's released from jail, he's quite literally homeless, and that's how he began his life on the streets. 

2) Scenario two: In my state if you get a DUI you have to go through a really tough program or go to jail for 6 months. Most people avoid both, because they get attorneys who get the charges reduced, but if you're poor that's obviously out of the question. However, if you get a second DUI (In this state as little as a single beer is enough for a DUI), you aren't getting those charges reduced again regardless... So you have to decide, 6 months in jail, or the super expensive program?

Most rational people will do anything to avoid jail, so they enter the program. Well, the program is just a financial drain beyond belief. First off, you have to spend thousands of dollars doing ""classes"" - all of which can be done online, are super easy, pointless, and just cost money to speed through a crappy slideshow to get to the easy quiz at the end to pass.

Once you pass that, now you have 4 ""counselling"" sessions per week: 2 group, 2 one on one. Those aren't cheap if you don't have good insurance. They'll reduce the cost for uninsured poor people, but still, that's close to 250 a week alone in counselling costs. 

But you also have 3 random drug tests a week. So that's another 150 dollars a week   

You also have to ""report to the court"" once a week which can take all day, meaning you can't work that day

You also have to have an ankle monitor on because you're technically on house arrest, so that's another 150 a month  

But the best part, is you MUST live alone (rationale is another person can cause you to slip up), so you can't even have roommates, thus have to pay for your own place  

But it's not over, the breathalyzer for the car, another 100 a month, insurance premiums which go up, plus another second DUI insurance, which is another 100 a month. 

Now this is where this ""program designed to keep people out of prison and help them"" becomes a nightmare. We are at about roughly 1900 dollars a month just in FEES to not be in jail for all these stupid programs, and that's before we even consider being forced to have your own place.

But the whole time you obviously need a job to pay this incredible burden you have to live under... But how the hell do you work a job when you have 3 random drug tests, 4 counsellings, and 1 whole day of waiting in court? You can work a 9-5, but it's REALLY hard. And if you accidentally drink too much water one day right before your random drug test, they'll interpret that diluted water pee as you trying to mask your urine, making it an instant fail, and you go straight to rehab for 30 days during your next weekly court -- which means: You lost your job, and now have an eviction on your record because you can't afford to pay your rent. Car break down on the way to one of your 4 counselling sessions? Also considered a failure, but instead you're thrown in jail. 

At this point, most people realize it would have just been easier to go to jail for 6 months and wait it out than deal with that stress. Failure is so common, and the courts just look at everyone as criminals and scoundrels so they don't care a bit.

``````````````````

So yeah, those are just two examples that I've seen which are super super super common. So many people in jails in my state, just got trapped in this negative feedback loop caused by an overbearing system that just creates so much opportunity for failure"

477,"I think most people would agree that, in hindsight, the US funding & training the Afghan Mujahideen to curb the Soviet sphere of influence was a bad idea. If anything, it only served to proliferate terrorism and created the power vacuum from which the Taliban were able to to emerge (twice).

But I wanted to know if people think this is just something that is easy to say with hindsight, or if it was genuinely poor foresight and a bad idea at the time for the US to become so intimately involved with a guerrilla group they knew to harbour a lot of very extreme radicals.

Also, I'd be interested to get peoples' opinions on exactly how responsible they think the US is for the decades of instability in Afghanistan. Even beyond being responsible for the Taliban finding their feet, invading in 2001 and toppling them surely only served to antagonise them & other terrorist groups further - yes America/NATO tried to stick around for 20 years to clean up and keep the peace, but the Taliban, whose rise they facilitated, had time on their side, were prepared to play the waiting game, and seized power pretty much immediately after the US washed their hands of Afghanistan. Could America have foreseen this too and played their hand differently?

Surely with the benefit of hindsight the only conclusion is that US policy in Afghanistan has been an utter failure - they paved the way for a terrorist group to take power for some Cold War propaganda capital, then had to overthrow that group, then spent two decades fending off their subsequent counter-insurgency, then watched that same group seize power as soon as they left. This is the way I see it but I may be ignorant of nuance or over-simplifying things - but my main question is whether these decisions were arguably just as bad *in the moment*, without hindsight.","The USA didn't train the Mujahideen.  People really overestimate how involved USA was in Afghansitan when in reality we had no ground presence there until the 2001 invasion.  All training was done by Pakistan who was also the party responsible for actually arming the rebel groups.  The USA's main role was more of a fundraiser and as a weapons smuggler and was generally hands off otherwise.  I wouldn't be surprised if the USA talked to China about Afghanistan more than they talked to actual on-ground Afghanistan fighters.

Also, I don't know if you are aware of this but some of the language in the text sorta hints you might not understand the relationship between the Mujahideen and the Taliban but to make it clear:  **Mujahideen =/= Taliban**.  The Taliban actually rose in opposition to the Mujahideen lead government in the 1990s and many Mujahideen leaders either fled the country or would form the domestic anti-Taliban groups in Afghanistan.  Many of the early Taliban fighters weren't even in Afghanistan during the war with the Soviets, but were actually in Pakistan.

I don't think the policy of funding/arming the resistance was a bad idea and it clearly worked.  The actual issue was our relations with Pakistan and pretty much giving them free reign to use the funding and weapons as they see fit.  It was Pakistan that decided to funnel most of the funds into Hekmatyar, who was known as one of the nastiest guys in a group of nasty guys, for their own interests.  It was Pakistan that decided to abandon him and decide to throw their weight behind the Taliban, who they armed and trained as Afghanistan broke out in Civil War.  And its Pakistan that essentially gave Taliban and other groups a safe harbor to lick their wounds.  The other controversial issue is our willingness and support of Saudi Arabia, whose education funding ended up being the basis for much of the Taliban ideology.

>invading in 2001 and toppling them surely only served to antagonise them & other terrorist groups further

It didn't actually.  The 2001 was devastating for them and they spent years calling for peace negotiations because they got destroyed so badly.  The big mess up in hindsight was that we should have taken up that offer, which many of our Afghan allies called for, and let a de-armed Taliban rejoin the Afghanistan government.  We didn't and years of Afghanistan government corruption and protection from Pakistan allowed the Taliban eventually to come back."
478,"I would consider myself a member of the US left. I'm feminist, pro-LGBTQ+, anti-racism, anti-capitalism, pro-welfare, pro-choice, pro-vax, anti-war, anti-oil, climate change realist, etc. The one classic big issue of contention that really confuses me is gun control.

(Well, maybe I could think of a few others if I thought hard about it -- right to privacy in the information age comes to mind -- but that's beside the point.)

I'm centrist on gun control, mostly for inability to decide.

I am just about the farthest possible thing from the sort of person who thinks school shootings and unprovoked violent crime are okay when they're white-on-colored or male-on-attractive-female or whatever. Absolutely not. I am a big believer that such incidents are never okay, pretty much no matter what.

In fact, I wish guns had never been invented. Better yet, I wish there were a way to destroy them all. Simultaneously, to prevent anyone from gaining a quick-draw advantage; without confiscation, so no one would wind up with all the coercive power; and permanently, such that it becomes impossible to ever again assemble a gun. This is almost certainly wildly unrealistic, but with scientific progress these days, who can say for sure? Please let me know if you ever invent an extremely powerful ""anti-death ray.""

And yet, the unfortunate fact of the matter is that guns do exist, and people use them, and we cannot destroy them all at once. What recourse do we have but to own them ourselves for protection?

The authoritarian left might say such matters should be resolved by the police. In a utopia where we can trust the police, maybe so. But I am of the *libertarian* left. (Not to be confused with the capitalist libertarian right.) If I know it's possible I might be targeted by violent crime at any moment, and my adversary might have a gun, *and* I believe I *cannot* rely on the police, then isn't carrying my *own* gun my only option?

I realize this sounds an awful lot like soapboxing. But I'm sincerely asking here. It's not as if I'm asking rhetorical questions here, smiling smugly behind the monitor because I already know those in favor of gun control have no counterargument to the position I've espoused. On the contrary, I know my objection is common, and I believe surely they *do* have a salient counterargument. I am ignorant to it, and would like to hear it, so as to be *less* ignorant, and form a better-informed opinion, no matter what it may end up being. That's all there is to this.","\> In a utopia where we can trust the police, maybe so. But I am of the libertarian left. (Not to be confused with the capitalist libertarian right.)

It's stuff like this that makes the political compass useless. It's isn't ""authoritarian"" to expect that the police force...you know, works. It isn't virtuous and ""libertarian"" to believe that you should oppose basic social services because they sometimes have a miniscule failure rate. Literally we live in a society and the whole purpose of society is that we *don't* have to take the law into our own hands. That's like the foundational concept behind government. If you can't operate on that as a somewhat basic premise for the whole thing, then you're not engaging with the political system at all, quadrant be damned.

I mean, there's just so much to break down about ""carrying my won gun be my only option."" Do you really think the right way to resolve any and all potential crime threats you may face, no matter what they are, is to pull out a gun? Do you really think that pulling out a gun will always be a sufficient condition to prevent said crime? If he has a gun, and you have a gun, does he just go ""oh, touche, guess I'll go find someone else?"" This is such facile logic. It's incredibly ideological, and only works when you completely ignore the fact that more guns almost always equals more crime and more violence. That's when the ""good guys"" have guns, too.

Further, the ""left"" isn't trying to get rid of all guns. They have no problem with reasonably using guns for personal defense--if you're at home and your house gets broken into, for example. Guns are also a fine recreational activity as long as they are effectively regulated to make sure there is safe use of them. We use a similar argument for cars to restrict people's rights on purchasing and use based on arbitrary discriminations and don't blink an eye. But if you are thinking that you must oppose gun control because there's a hypothetical where you get mugged and the police don't teleport in front of you and a gun will prevent that...well I hate to break it to you but lots of people with guns get mugged, or beat up, or shot, or killed, or literally whatever crime you're thinking of. There is NO evidence that having a gun on your person makes you immune to crime. 

My advice? Drop the political compass ideology nonsense and read a book on criminal justice. There's going to be lots of options at your local library. It's perfectly defensible to disbelieve in gun control. But it's important to have a good argument for defending your beliefs, and right now the way you get that is by reading some better quality information."

484,"Additional question:

Does the US/other major western countries even invest into the developing countries in any significant way? If they do, how?

I havent done any research into the subject, just what I have picked from different western medias. When it comes to the developing world, the western media perceptive seems to be that the west is offering them aid out of goodness of their heart, which is ineffective because of corruption, while China is robbing them blind with these projects and ""taking over"". Taking over what exactly? What is stopping the western countries from making similar investments?

I'd like to understand the reality behind these tired stereotypes.","Of course, much of the conversation around this issue is poorly understood opinion nonsense. So the basic premise of your question here isn't really a very good one. The US DOES invest in other countries quite substantially. 

For example, do you remember Lindsey Graham and others decrying the budget ""paying for gender studies in Pakistan?"" It was a big thing a few years ago because it was absurd enough to get people angry over something that seems pretty obviously a dumb idea.

Of course, it actually wasn't as simple as Graham was suggesting. The foreign aid the US was sending to Pakistan wasn't for gender studies nor was it a blank check to the Pakistani government. Rather, the US had budgetary space carved out to support women's organizations in Pakistan, including some that focused on things like helping women get driver's licenses. This should be a pretty obvious thing Americans are happy to support--one of the reasons we don't fully get along with Pakistan is because of cultural and religious differences that have created a significantly less free and small-l liberal political system. Well, ensuring women have the same political and social freedoms as men is about as direct a way to work on changing that as can possibly exist. 

Another good example is NATO. NATO is essentially a foreign aid agreement where lots of countries band together in common purpose to protect their basic values both militarily and to a certain extent economically and politically. For a country like Germany or the UK where there's a lot of commonality and overlap already, this is mostly a matter of reinforcing tendencies already present, but in a country like Hungary, that is rapidly moving away from liberal democratic values, this collective authority is a form of foreign investment that is much more meaningful.

But to get to the later parts of your question, you may have noticed that these are two big time examples that have both seen major pushback from a portion of the American electorate. NATO has been under fire from some voters for ""not paying their fair share"" and, well, we already mentioned Graham's criticisms of encouraging American values in Pakistan. Essentially, we've seen these efforts curtailed a bit in recent years as American nationalism has become an increasingly significant part of the US political spectrum.

Part of that is justified--foreign aid isn't always productive, and anyone who remembers or studied Cold War history could tell you that. Whether it's Nixon style ""modernization theory"" or Carter style compassionate human rights focused foreign policy, history is full of recent examples of investments in foreign aid that didn't really work out. But those examples are largely overshadowed by the good examples--the Marshall Plan was literally ""hey let's give unlimited free money to Europe with no strings attached at all"" and it was probably the most successful foreign policy idea this country has ever had, directly contributing to the formation of NATO.

Essentially, you're asking a pretty complicated question. Right now there are a lot of Americans that want to focus more on domestic concerns--and they have a point. The US is lagging behind the rest of the Western world in most infrastructure metrics, and so even for some liberal folks it's a tough pill to swallow to fix issues in other societies without guarantees that they will bear fruit. But that whole thing implies that America used to be more willing to invest in foreign aid, and the demand certainly hasn't gone down.

So the talk about China ""taking over"" is certainly mostly done very poorly, but the basic point that China is filling the foreign aid void as America scales back its commitments isn't wrong. As Americans are less willing to take on risks that would expand NATO and maybe aggravate Russia or create a social security system in the Shah's Iran (only for it to revolt and become an US enemy), just to think of two examples, China is looking to expand its sphere of influence and is more willing to take those risks. Calling that ""taking over"" is a bit...limited, to be kind...but the point remains that right now the US-led global economic and political order represented by NATO is seeing some competition more robust than any point since the fall of the Soviet Union. That doesn't mean China will ""win,"" whatever that means, nor does it mean the West/US is screwed, but it does mean that our diplomats do need to consider that the American political and economic situation may not stay the way it is now without some effort on their part to maintain it."

486,"If a natural-born citizen renounces their citizenship for some reason, becomes stateless, then reapplies for citizenship, are they still considered natural-born citizens? Could they run for president, since they'd have a birth certificate and all that?

Just curious, as apparently some countries demand you only have citizenship with them and require you to become stateless before applying for citizenship.","The reality of a lot of US law boils down to: “we’ll decide once it happen”. 

The law as it is does not stipulate what happens in this  exact scenario and would rely on basically a scenario to test it, and be raised with the Court to decide. (And obviously a tough scenario, hard to imagine the public voting for someone who felt so seriously as to renounce their citizenship). 

That being said, the US is actually rare in this scenario - the larger number of countries in fact won’t allow citizens to renounce citizenship if it would render them stateless. In the case of those that don’t allow dual citizenship, naturalisation usually will either just not be a possibility or has a mechanism to take a seamless transition (often a form of conditional approval, to take effect the moment you renounce your prior citizenship). Though there are exceptions."
487,"If so, what would this look like, considering it hasn't happened yet?","There is no formal mechanism to do so within the founding documents of NATO. I.e. there is no clause within the treaty to say, under these circumstances or through these mechanisms, a member can be formally expelled. 

That being said, this was a question a few times, notably during the initial negotiations around NATO’s founding when the Canadian proposed including an expulsion clause. But more recently when concerns rose over Turkey’s engagement in Syria and Kurdistan, a common argument raised was that though there was no mechanism to do so, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (basically the rules on how to do rules) included the clause on “material breach” which in simple terms is to say that if one party of a treaty so seriously violated the fundamental aspects of the treaty, then the treaty could be, by unanimous consent of all but the violating party, be suspended in whole or in part. In NATO’s case, the treaty involves a long affirmation of the principles and values of the alliance - if the other members considered a country in egregious violation of these principles and values codified in the founding treaty, they could, according to the argument, unanimously consent that the violating party failed to meet those basic tenets of the treaty and thus suspend it in part (namely, the part that would include the violating country)"

I would think the student would need to prove to the grant provider (the govt I guess) in China his or her enrollment and maybe more info about the Canadian school.

491,"I was just thinking about the fact that mercenary groups exist and I'm sure some have their own air force. Is it possible for the Ukraine to use them for their No-fly zone?
Or are PMCs wary of getting too involved against a place like Russia?","So this question could likely be broadened to ask ""Can Ukraine hire private military to reinforce their armed forces?""

For the no-fly zone, there are SOME private forces that have war-ready planes. But there are three major issues with using them. The first is these forces aren't large. No private company (or even multiple private companies) is going to have enough planes to rival Russia. So any hired force would be at a pretty big numerical disadvantage off the bat. Ukraine has hundreds of planes, Russia has thousands, so hiring 50 planes won't make a huge difference 

The second is supplying these planes. It's unlikely neighboring countries would allow a private military force to set up base within their borders with the current situation, and there are no private aircraft carriers in the world, so these planes would all have to be housed and supplied within and by Ukraine. While the US and other countries will supply Ukraine with weapons, supplying private citizens to fight Russia could escalate the situation, as that could be interpreted as (the US for example) hiring and supplying a private army to fight Russia. So ensuring these private planes are equipped with fuel, weapons, and maintenance would be far from assured even if they were hired.

The third is actually getting these pilots to fly. Most of the private air force units (at least in the US) do training missions alongside the US and other Western militaries. While I won't say impossible, I'd be surprised if these private pilots would agree to enter an active warzone where they are severely outnumbered to enforce a no-fly zone, especially since many of these pilots may be out of practice with live missiles and actual combat experience. It's one thing to have private pilots flying training missions versus them agreeing to enter a warzone (that frankly isn't directly in their benefit)."
492,"I've been wondering recently but what is it that makes European countries (or culturally western world if we add America and Australia) relatively rich compared to the rest of the world?

In the light of recent sanctions and considering that China is closer to Russia than it is to the west I've been thinking about what ""The West"" is losing vs what ""the East"" is losing and I'm not reaching positive conclusions. 

Let's start with what ""The West"" is losing by sanctioning ""The East"" - by which I'll mean mostly China+Russia. Russia is a major exporter of various fuels and natural resources. China is also exporting natural resources as well as... consumer goods - name any product at all and you can bet that China is producing it. 

In the event, the trade stops between the West and East Europe loses the fuels, all the production facilities, major sources of natural resources and I've heard Russia produces a lot of fertilizer and wheat (like 40% of global supply or something of this scale). The way I see it Europe will have shortages of food and practically everything else almost sending us to medieval ages due to food shortages and the inability to quickly produce production facilities - all the resources and most of the know-how on how to build them stays in the east after all.

And what is East losing? There are some regional products like French wine, cheeses and so on but it's not impossible to recreate - and the production process is often found on Youtube and could be recreated relatively easily. There are western engineers and scientists but again, they also exist in the East. And I'd be hard-pressed to name something of significance besides German engineers. We also have some decent pharmacy corporations but again - a lot of production facilities and resources needed come from the east. The culture like polish CD Projekt, movies, Facebook (the last one is from the USA though)? it's not that the East doesn't have its creators so it's not a major loss.

In general, western science was the greatest achievement of our culture but we've been exporting it for over 100 years - at this point, the scientific capacities of the east aren't much worse than western - as evidenced by supersonic missiles Russia has fired recently. Given that a lot of knowledge is more or less publicly available and that a lot of practical production happens in the east I wouldn't say it's a crippling blow to the east. China has also been proactively stealing a lot of western intellectual property so in the case of an iron curtain event they would have a decent head start.

The only thing that the west, or rather the USA, managed to safeguard is the advanced chip manufacture know-how and blueprints but again - there are many production facilities in Taiwan and China is focusing efforts to be able to manufacture their own technology - I imagine the process would be faster if they decided to go Ukraine on Taiwan and overtake Taiwanese production facilities.

&#x200B;

SO...

With this lengthy preamble, if suddenly all trade and relations stopped between east and west, what western, and more specifically European thing would ""the east"" lose that would be a heavy blow? Maybe besides chip manufacture which is more of USA thing anyways :)

I'm not sure if I stated the question correctly but I don't know how to put it otherwise.","A lot of the stuff needed to run the factories in the east is made in the west. Western investments are also oftentimes needed to build up factories + the factories that are already there wouldn't have anyone to sell to. I would hope that we could replace a lot of the current production with machines, although I wouldn't be too sure about that working. The west (including South America) also produces huge amounts of food, so I don't think we'd be entirely lost there. I would count Taiwan and probably Japan to the west, meaning the east would lack a huge amount of technologie.  
At the end of the day, everyone would be f\*\*\*\*\*, not just the west."

499,"According to the news article [Zelensky Has Survived Over a Dozen Assassination Attempts, Ukraine Claims](https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelenskyy-assassination-attempt-killing-ukraine-president-russia-1686329), Volodymyr Zelensky was able to avoid these assassination attempts due to warnings from anti-war intelligence officers in Russia's Federal Security Services.

Even if 12 assassination attempts is an exaggeration, why would Russia prefer to assassinate Zelensky instead of capturing him? Say what you want about the 2003 invasion of Iraq, but even in that case, Saddam Hussein was captured and put on trial. Even if the trial was unfair, the USA took the long path instead of simply assassinating him.","A comparison to Iraq is a bit silly. The US took out the Iraqi army in all of 25 minutes, more or less. The entire country was occupied basically without any serious resistance.

Zelensky is mounting an effective defense that most experts believed impossible. Not only that, ideologically he's considered a hero and is easily winning the ""who does the world like"" side of the war. Russia wants to take him out because they're confident of one of three things: 1) he would be less effective at leading the military defense of Ukraine, 2) he would be less effective at winning the hearts and minds of the global community, or 3) losing Zelensky would be a strong enough blow to morale of the troops and citizens that Russia would be able to conquer the country more effectively."
500,"Back in 2016 after the Orlando nightclub shooting it seemed like political suicide to gay bash or push an anti-gay agenda. We also had a widely hated Westborough church, who no one wanted to be on the same side of. Did something happen? Or did we just back peddle while being distracted? I ask because these issues shouldn't be issues anymore right?","Well, for one thing, 2016 was not that long ago. The homophobic politicians and ideologues didn't really go away. They just put that issue on the back burner for a while and have now picked it back up with a new argument.

In 2012 the argument was hyperfocused on marriage, in 2016 on workplace and commercial discrimination. Now the argument is focused on schools and kids, they're saying, ""we don't oppose LGBT+ rights; we just don't want our kids exposed ""to sexual content"" in schools.""

This fits in really well with the Republican's broader midterm strategy. Ever since the first school closures at the beginning of the pandemic, Conservatives have been harnessing parents' (and non-parents) anger at the (real and imagined) failures of the education system. They started by focusing on reopening schools, then they added CRT after the George Floyd Protests, not they are adding the anti-LGBT+ rhetoric as well.

The other big difference is that Trans issues were not really a focus back in 2016, but they have come to the forefront today. While Homophobia has gone down dramatically in the last decade, Transphobia is declining at a much lower rate, and many people are hearing about or meeting Trans people for the first. The issues around HRT, GCS, and Puberty blockers also line up  well with the Conservative Covid/Vaccine skeptic rhetoric."
501,"For example, is there any kind of policy or reason Ukraine could not assassinate Putin if given the chance? Or is that basically considered fair game?

This is more of a general question, but I wondered about it while thinking of the current situation in Ukraine. So a response using this example would be good as well.","It's important to understand in questions like this that there is no unit of sovereignty higher than a country. That's why we can't make war illegal. Who would enforce it? And how could they do that without the consent and buy in of a country, which means the other organization doesn't matter anyway?

So in that sense, technically a country can do whatever it wants. Putin CAN invade Ukraine, and other countries CAN get very mad about it and do everything they can to hobble Putin's efforts. Ukraine CAN assassinate Putin, and Russia (or other countries) CAN retaliate by prosecuting that person for murder and taking diplomatic or military action as well.

The only thing that can hold a country's action in check is another country and that's more in a ""let's both put the safety on at the same time"" kind of way rather than a ""I'm putting the safety on for you/before I give this back to you"" kind of way. In this case, I'm pretty sure the entire world except for Russia would turn a blind eye if Ukrainian operatives took out Putin. But if Iraqis killed Bush in 2003 that wouldn't have gone over as well. There isn't a hard and fast rule here because the unit of sovereignty we're playing with is at the country level."
502,"I agree that if there are many applicants for a few positions (Harvard) we don't want anyone who couldn't hack it to take one of those positions. But if some research is done and a few positions are given and those chosen end up being as talented as KBJ, doesn't it show the program to be effective?","Well yes, it absolutely would show that. There is no other logical conclusion that could be made. So if there's such a clear flaw in the point being made, then why would Carlson make it?

Because it's not about that point at all. Carlson isn't engaging in a good faith examination of Brown's qualifications relative to other candidates. If he was, then he'd be just as upset about Clarence Thomas' selection and I've never seen him get bent out of shape about that. Hell, even Barrett was (comparatively) poorly qualified for SCOTUS nomination when she got the nod.

Carlson is looking for a way to cast aspersions on Brown's nomination, but because she's a fairly well rounded and solid pick, this is the best line of attack Carlson can come up with. So he spins it as much as he needs to get people talking, because that's what Carlson does. It's a pattern he's used time and time again."
503,Does 'the 1%' mean the top 1% by annual income or the top 1% by net worth?,"According to the Cambridge dictionary of English: the richest one percent of people, who are said to have most of the money, property, and power in society. So it sounds like net worth not income."
504,"What is the term for someone who is Progressive on economic issues, but socially conservative? I used to be one of those when I was younger, and I am just curious as to what this is called. Are there any parties or organizations with this viewpoint?","There isn't much of a name for this position because it's not a very stable position for anyone to hold. Progressive economic issues sort of require an openness to social change in at least some areas, which means being socially conservative gets in the way of being economically progressive. Basically, believing one forces you to abandon the other.

Economically conservative but socially progressive doesn't really run into this problem. It's essentially ""you do whatever you want, but do it with your own resources."" It's very possible to jealously guard your own money but be perfectly happy with society doing whatever it wants outside of that island. It's not really possible to believe that economics should aggressively solve the problems of society and also believe that society shouldn't change.

And I get you used to believe that, but the point is used to. Most folks who hold this contradictory position tend to either be not very well informed about the issues they are talking about, or they are in a period of transition where you're still getting to a consistent belief system. There just hasn't been a population or political perspective that has been able to consistently hold these beliefs simultaneously."

The value of Crimea as a base would be as a *naval* base. However, the U.S. can't move military vessels through Turkish waters to enter the Black Sea, so Crimea doesn't have any real value.

In theory, the U.S. could establish an air or ground base. However, those are invariably placed in the hinterlands where land costs are cheaper. Also, before U.S. troops are deployed into a friendly nation, a status of forces agreement is always negotiated - and no attempt was ever made to do so."
506,"Years ago Chile did very well military and fought against 3 countries by itself.

Chile has around 19M whole population, and Peru & Bolivia has around 44M together while Argentina which on a previous war helped Peru&Bolivia has 45M whole population.

Nowadays, I wonder how likely is Chile to defend himself in a war with nearby countries. (In consideration of current technology, investment on equipment, military population and tactics, etc).

As so, is now Chile weak compared to nearby countries and likely to lose?   
Argentina has a dubious status, hardly someone can tell if it would help Chile or Peru&Bolivia, or remain abstinent.","First thing first: 

>Years ago Chile did very well military and fought against 3 countries by itself.

Which are the 3 countries you mention in your statement? The Pacific War was between Perú and Bolivia, on one side, and Chile on the other.

Chile's military is not weak, it has a decent budget and a capable navy. The country is ranked 47 in the global military ranking made by Global Firepower, below Perú and Argentina, and on top of Bolivia. Besides that, Chile, as all the other southamerican countries, has a ""dissuasion"" oriented military, prepared only for the defense of the territorial integrity of the country. Southamética remains, to this day, the most peacefull region in the planet. This increases the further south you go, reaching it's cenit in the southern cone. This means neither Chile, nor Argentina, Uruguay or Paraguay would support an invasion.

>Argentina has a dubious status

Care to explain what you mean? Argentina and Chile have a really close relationship. The last episode of tensions between the countries happened in the late 70s, and since both countries regained democracy relations began to thrive. The frontrier passes are always busy, since people from both sides go to the other country daily."
507,"So the Germans assimilated into Americans. So did the Irish. And the Italians. And all these other populations from Africa. We’re not able to tell them apart from other Americans. But how about the ones from Latin America? There are still lots of Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, etc in the USA and they haven’t assimilated. When will they assimilate?

To me assimilation is when people can’t tell you apart from the general American population. You have heritage from those countries but you’re not identified as someone from those countries anymore. You’re just American.

Note: I’m aware Puerto Rico is USA territory.","What do you mean they haven't assimilated.  By the first generation, nearly all of those folks speak fluent English, go to school just like anybody.  They work all kinds of jobs, join all kinds of clubs and churches.  We have piñatas and missions and a ton of Spanish words in our language.

To my knowledge she is pro-life, and a war hawk. If she had a D behind her name, she would be primaried out of congress. 

what am I missing?","Liz Cheney is one of the few remaining ""moderate"" Republicans (what many republicans would now call RINOs (Republican In Name Only)). Remember when Trump was nominated in 2016, there were MANY Republicans who spoke out against him: his rhetoric, his inexperience, his policies, etc. But after his election, most of the Republicans shifted significantly further right when they realized he actually won, and was actually very popular with the Republican voters. There was still a contingency of moderate Republicans from 2016-2020, but they were slowly eliminated from the government (people like Jeff Flake, Bob Corker, Justin Amash,  Adam Kinzinger, etc.). Now there seem to be a handful of Republicans left who haven't committed to the Trump-style politics and policies, and Liz Cheney is one of them.

While Democrats disagree with her on most policy issues, they ""respect"" her as a politician and a person for taking (what they would call) reasonable stances. She is on the January 6th commission, has spoken out against Trump publicly on controversial subjects, and seems to harken back to the Republican party of the 2000's instead of what we have now.

It's the same way Republicans ""like"" Gabbard. Gabbard has few policy similarities with Republicans, but many Republicans see her as a reasonable, moderate Democrat, and would support her style of politics over many of the other Democratic leaders and politicians we see today. In 2020, many Republicans said they would consider voting for a ""reasonable"" Democrat like Gabbard over Trump."
509,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't US oil prices down at the moment? If so, wouldn't it make more sense for Biden to turn to domestic producers as opposed to abroad anywhere. I would also appreciate a description of how the crude oil industry works, as well as the Biden administration's reasoning behind turning to foreign producers despite pushback from both sides of the aisle.","The OPEC cartel intentionally produces less oil than they could to drive up prices and earn themselves more money.  They have wells that they could activate very quickly to increase production, but that they usually leave idle.

Whereas in the US there isn't spare production capacity like that lying around, or at least not much.  It'd take years for US to increase production by much, and given the expense of producing oil in the US many of them are reluctant to invest that money as there were some major losses a few years ago from investing in US oil production."
510,Do they enjoy significant popular support or are they just isolated groups/russian astroturfing? It's hard to me to see what is true beyond the propaganda.,"Unsatisfyingly, there's no clean answer I don't think. 

So maybe helpfully, maybe unhelpfully, here's a few cuts on things we do know, especially compared to Crimea, and reasons those aren't necessarily good ways of proxy analysing it. 

To start, Putin's argument with Crimea (and with Luhansk and Donetsk) is largely some form of a 'defence and reintegration of Russians'. Crimea and Lunhansk / Donetsk are pretty different here already. While Crimea, as of 2014 polling, is predominantly ethnically Russian (saving discussion on how that came to be for another day) with \~65% ethnic Russians in Crimea (vs around 15% ethnic Ukrainian and 12% Tatars). Luhansk and Donetsk are a more even cut (47-48, 48-49) between those reporting themselves as ethnically Russian or ethnically Ukrainian. They are however, predominantly Russian speaking as their primary language - ethnic Russians and Ukrainians alike (for the most part). That's the slight shift in the rhetoric from Putin on 'defending' or 'liberating' Russians in Ukraine - while the argument was heavily drawing on ethnic majority in Crimea, that's a weaker argument in Luhansk and Donetsk - where the argument tends to draw on other gripes around policies the Ukrainian government tried to undertake on language recognition. That all being said, neither ethnicity nor language group necessarily determines support. Ethnic Russians aren't inherently going to support breaking away to Russia, many ethnic Russians will be proudly and patriotically Ukrainian by nationality and take that identity first before ethnicity. Russian-speakers, even those upset by those language recognition policies, won't necessarily want to breakaway either. And to be frank, there probably are some number of ethnic Ukrainians in those regions who may actually support breaking away too. All to say, useful to note the difference between Luhansk and Donetsk vs Crimea but ethnic or linguistic lines aren't necessarily a trustworthy proxy on support for separatist movements. 

Polling always has difficulties though can usually control for some those to a large extent to get at more comfortable numbers. I don't think we have anything close to that here. In part because there are dynamics on who can reliably conduct a valid poll - which is just logistically difficult here given pressure on voicing opinions, logistical hurdles of trying to poll people in an active warzone, and a bunch of other potentially skewing dynamics (trying to go pre-active conflict has its own issues too). One of the more frequently cited polls from IRI got a sample from the Donbas that was controlled in 2017 by Ukraine still - which obviously is not great at getting to the core of separatist controlled areas and the opinions there - where most of the support for separatist movements would be. But it does include overwhelming support for maintaining the whole of the Donbas region in Ukraine in the areas they did poll (again, which were the Ukrainian controlled territories so obviously huge asterisk) at around 73%. 

Apart from that, what we have is the referenda and counter-referenda, none of which can or are viewed by anyone close to impartial with any grain of credibility from either side. 

How much support they actually have within the separatist controlled regions or even if that's a majority, we probably can't know. Though probably safe to say, there likely is a significant contingent of support, but probably also less than those separatist movements would argue there is."

513,"So this question has been bugging me for a while, with the whole situation in Ukraine right now, we see a lot of international response in terms of economic sanctions and arms shipments. And yet no country has stepped up to try and resolve the conflict through diplomacy or at least to mediate the  conflict. 

I remember the 5-day war, aka the South Ossetia War, aka the Russo-Georgian War, aka the 08.08.08 war and that was also a conflict between Russia and a former Soviet Republic. Back then Sarkozy, the French President at the time stepped up and through EU mediation, there was the 6-point peace plan.

And yet now, countries seem to be more focused on withdrawing from Russia or arming Ukraine. The only version of ""talks"" is fluff groups meeting in Minsk with zero impact (and one of the Ukrainian negotiators later killed back at his homeland). The whole international solidarity with Ukraine seems to be more of a Twitter campaign in that it's not helping. 

People are discussing sending old Soviet planes, Javelins and NLAWs as if Ukraine has a chance against a Superpower, while no one seems to be willing to discuss setting up talks to resolve the situation or at least minimize the damage.

So why has no one from the EU or US stepped up?",Macron has been doing this for over a month.  He just had a lengthy phone call with Putin a few days ago.
514,"It seems to me that the south is a lot more conservative than the rest of the country. I'm from Seattle and it's a very secular and liberal place to say the least. The entire PNW is pretty secular and not religious. 

It seems to me that the South in contrast to even the Midwest is a lot more conservative. How is the south different from the rest of America? Why is this?","It's driven by white supremacy. The south had slavery of course, but after the civil war, there was continuing exploitation of black laborers by wealthy southern whites. It was not quite slavery, but wealthy southern whites encouraged the racism because it made black workers easier exploit. The racism crippled the labor movement as white laborers were more reluctant to form coalitions and unions with black laborers.

Cotton farming was still a big thing in the south after the war, and instead of using black slaves, they used black sharecroppers. They were technically free but they tended to be underpaid, and many were snared in debt bondage (a system which is always rigged such that the debt peon never gets out of debt).

Have you heard of the Great Migration?  In the early 20th century, black people in the south migrated in large numbers to the north to work in factories in Chicago, Detroit, and other places, where wages were better.  Southern farmers and industrialists were furious about this because it resulted in a labor shortage. Southern governments tried to stem the flow by forbidding northern labor agents from talking to black people, they shut down train stations near black communities, and sometimes police would just show up at train stations and tear up the tickets of black people trying to leave.  But there wasn't all that much they could do and some white employers were (gasp!) forced to raise wages.

The pre-war slaveowners encouraged racism because that made slavery morally and politically acceptable.  The post-war white capitalists continued to encourage racism because that made it easier to exploit both white and black laborers (but blacks in particular).

I think the invention of cotton-harvesting machines contributed to a lessening of racism.  It definitely made southern cotton farmers less upset about the black labor emigration.  Cotton harvesting machines made cotton farming less labor-intensive and therefore reduced the demand for exploited labor.  Mechanization in other forms of agriculture must have had a similar effect.

I think that in the latter half of the 20th century, southern racism mostly coasted on inertia and has been going down.  Things down south are definitely nicer than it was back in the 70s."
515,Why is the response to Russia invading Ukraine so different than the USA invading Iraq,"Neither the invasion of Ukraine or Iraq was 'illegal' because there's no such concept without some body to enforce law. So when people claim either is 'illegal', they're simply expressing disagreement with a certain government's policy (incorrectly).

In terms of sanctions or international backlash, it's not too hard to see why. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is viewed as an incremental threat directed at Europe and Russia is not trusted on the international stage. In contrast, the U.S. invasion of Iraq was viewed as a way of removing a government that most nations viewed as illegitimate and the U.S. *is* trusted on the world - no one seriously believed the U.S. was attempting to colonize Iraq."
516,The country's political system was tenuous and fractional in the early days of the American occupation. Have things gotten any better? Is their economy improving? Is the oil industry expanding?,"Things are somewhat better, with very strong emphasis on the 'somewhat'. There is no raging sectarian civil war, but that's about it. Hatreds between the Sunnis, Shias and Kurds are as deep as ever. Most of the Shia (except Muqtada al-Sadr and his supporters) are marionettes dancing to the tunes of Tehran. Most of the Sunni still harbour nostalgia for the reign of Saddam, when they were at the top of the food chain. And the Kurds are independent in all but name. Corruption is as rife as ever. Government jobs are doled out as patronage, rather than being filled on the basis of merit. The sectarian 'muhasasa' political system (identical to that of Lebanon, which is currently famous for all the wrong reasons) has ensured the creation of sectarian fiefdoms."
517,"I know that the definitions kinda depend on where you're from. Left-wing ideologies are seen as more ""extreme"" in the US, while they are completely normal in Europe.

Where I'm from all the terms above often get put together, and if you're a Leftist you are often automatically seen as a Liberal, Progressive and a Socialist, which I don't necessarily believe is true.","Liberalism is a political movement that is all about individual freedom and rights.

Progressivism is a political movement that cares about social reform and progression, a movement forward contrary to conservatism which prefers to keep things as they are.

Socialism is a wide political idea that in its core cares about social ownership of the means of production.

A leftist is basically someone who is more towards the left side of the political spectrum in the place they currently live in.

> Where I'm from

See, that's where things get confusing. Because political parties nowadays are all about framing and political ideology is not something that is very strong amongst the people anymore.

On the international political spectrum both the DNC and GOP (assuming you're from the US) would be right-wing parties. But since the DNC is ""lesser right-wing"" in the American spectrum they get called leftists.

Both parties are also liberals since both care a lot about individual freedom. One more to the other, on certain aspects, but they still care about it.

The DNC are called socialists as a form of attack because during the Red Scare in the US and the days of McCarthyism the term 'socialist' basically became a slur for people on the left. It's ironic because the average socialist hates the DNC just as much as the GOP. That's because as a liberal party they think private ownership of property is an individual right that society isn't allowed to interfere with whereas socialist think that the private property should be under democratic control of the masses."
518,One occasionally hears about the propaganda that countries like China or Russia deliver to their citizens. Surely some degree of the populace there believes what they are told. How can someone tell if they’re in a similar situation? Or is all news some form of propaganda and it’s just a matter of degrees? Is the difference in whether or not the media is state sponsored?,"Can you access foreign news?  In China, they block foreign websites like Reuters, and using a VPN to get around the block is illegal.  In America, you can access foreign news such as The Guardian and BBC.  Most Americans choose to ignore them, but that's another matter.

Also, look for disagreement among the news organizations. In America, you get lots of news sources that disagree with each other.  The fact that CNN and Fox News say different things and love to shriek at each other is at least a sign that the press in America is still free. By contrast, in China all the news sites agree that Xi Jinping is a wonderful man."
519,"I’ve never understood why every single political viewpoint becomes such a rigid partisan issue. People seem to just align their views with 100% of what their party believes. Seems a bit odd to me.

Why does there seem to be like no middle ground? I try not to let my views be purposed solely around what most democrats think.

I just don’t understand. Like just because your pro-life - you have to be pro drill oil? 

If you’re pro 2a - you can’t support renewable resources?

Especially something like energy. I don’t understand how someone could possibly think our energy solution is to increase domestic oil drilling. Isn’t it pretty much a widely accepted fact man made climate change is very much real? And could essentially eliminate the human race? Regardless of your other views, why wouldn’t you want the US to be a leader in the energy sector?","Most people's political opinions are not based on their own reasoned analysis but rather group affinity. What they believe is what the group believes and they value group membership more than they value the practical application of policy.

Even if you start from a reasoned position on one particular issue, the community you find yourself in tends to influence your beliefs on all other issues more than the people on the other side do.

Imagine for a moment you feel strongly that gay people shouldn't be subject to random beatings for holding hands in public, but you don't have any strong feelings about abortion either way. Your first belief is going to lead you to associate with gay rights activists. But despite the fact it's tough to imagine two issues less linked than abortion and gay rights, spending all that time around gay rights activists is likely to make you care much more about expansive abortion rights."
520,A lot of Russian embassies are huge and gaudy buildings. Could a country seize an embassy and give the diplomats a basement or warehouse instead?,"Could they technically? Sure - in the way theoretically a country could almost do anything - but for what gain and for what cost. 

I think first there has to be the understanding of how embassies work and what their status is. Embassy buildings aren't (*usually*) buildings just picked out and handed out by the receiving country. I.e. France wouldn't be 'giving diplomats a basement or a warehouse anyway. Countries find their own embassy locations (though sometimes, especially in cases of particular relationships with particularly impressive embassies, they are leased via the government - think of embassies located in historical buildings or locations owned by the national government for heritage protection). 

The big thing is, embassies are also protected under international law. While it's a common misconception that they're 'soil of their country' - that's actually not the case. That being said, they are guaranteed in international law from intrusion or disruption from the hosting government. That usually manifests as basically something closer to diplomatic immunity within the bubble of the embassy but not necessarily total sovereignty of that land. For example, Julian Assange pretty famously took up residence in the Ecuadorian embassy, with their permission, in London - to avoid arrest and extradition by the UK. Even though the UK police said they could (they couldn't), they weren't actually able to just get a warrant and go in and arrest him the way they would if he was just in a regular British office building or flat. There are international legal protection that protect a hosting country from enforcing their laws into those protected buildings of diplomatic business. That being said, when Ecuador rented that building, the land does not magically become territory that belongs to Ecuador - it's just given extra protections. International law equally protects diplomats themselves. So while people usually see the annoyances of diplomatic immunity (i.e. diplomats parking in no parking zones in New York or some more egregious cases) - it is meant to serve as a universal mutual understanding that diplomats are there on behalf of their country, to represent their country diplomatically - and thus should be protected. 

So to your question, could a country just forcibly shut down an embassy? Sure but it would come at huge diplomatic cost. Your embassies and your diplomatic staff are now at risk and you would be seen as a clear aggressor. And if for some reason you tried to forcibly move the staff to another location, it's borderline kidnapping of diplomatic officials. Wars have been started for that. 

That being said, governments can and do eject or expel ambassadors and sometimes wider diplomatic staff. But that's done more professionally than to seize and shut down an embassy."
521,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask.

From what I can tell, it seems that some countries are allowed higher production quotas than others. It doesn't seem to match with proven reserves. For example, Angola produces 1.7M/day with 8.4 billion in reserve while kuwait is allowed 2.9M/day with 101 Billion in reserves.

&#x200B;

So is there some political mechanism for deciding the production volumes?","OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), 13 countries in all, negotiates among themselves to decide the output.

The intention is to keep prices at a maximum. It would be illegal for any group of companies to do this in most countries, because it's a cartel, but this is above that type of law.

Sometimes, the members squabble, and one or more of them will refuse to stick to the limits. In that case, Saudi Arabia might deliberately hold back in order to compensate, thereby keeping prices high.

It's hardly a perfect system for the OPEC countries, but it does work in their favour. Of course, it's awful for everyone else.

There's a silver lining, though: By keeping prices high, people and companies are more inclined to invest in green energy, which is helpful for the environment."

There is a lot of talk about there being ""neo nazis"" or some extreme far right nationalists in Ukraine as described by Putin and the Russian. government.Granted Ukraine does have a problem with nationalists and far right groups doing some deplorable stuff but they are in the minority in Ukraine, maybe loud but from what I can conceptualize they are the minority.Similarly during the events of Serbia invading Croatia very similar reasons were given by Serbia.Is it hence possible to say that describing Ukraine and its leadership and some people/groups as neo nazis could be a parallel to Serbia for instance under Milosevic referring to whether officially or in culture and similar to Croatian leadership and people/groups as the ustaše/Croatian fascists?

Disclaimer — I am not trying to say here that this invasion is similar in intent to the wars in fmr. Yugoslavia which became genocidal and ethno-nationalist and I also understand on a realistic level there is a lot of other political influences that play a part here however my question is merely that if this is in anyway comparable to the situation in Yugoslavia (Particularly Serbia and Croatia as a example of discourse) especially after hearing Putin’s speeches regarding Ukraine and his stance on them as a nation (I also will try and take this with a grain of salt for those who have a purely realistic outlook and just consider this his “political” duty as he is a politician and has to present things accordingly)","The yugoslav wars were a result of an internal colapse where as the russian invasion is a... invasion

The all sides but especialy the serbians fought the war with genocidal and irridentist goals, where as russia sees ukraine and ukrainians as already russians... this conflict is realy unique but if you realy want to compare it, some aspects of it are compareble to the iraq war

How can NATO conduct and lead operations and interventions abroad? The founding treaty of NATO, as far as I know, does not imply that NATO exists for any other purpose than self-defense for its members. Has NATO always had this ""mandate"", but not used it until after the fall of the USSR? Are there specific treaties or laws in NATO that mention this as something NATO can do?","""International law"" is what nation states make of it. There's not some world government that enforces treaty conditions, it is up to the parties to resolve disputes and decide how things are meant to be interpreted. International organizations like the WTO, UN, etc., serve as forums and arbitration venues, but only have power as far as the parties in dispute agree to follow it's judgement. This is why you virtually  ever see winning armies at Hague, why the US likes dragging smaller countries through the WTO (""accept the judgement or we'll inflict far worse economic issues on you anyway""), etc.

I say all this most to say that...NATO went to Bosnia and other places abroad because the members in NATO agreed it was a good idea to do so. There are arguments to be made (and I'm sure were made) that instability on it's periphery is not good for the NATO security situation. But ultimately, the members NATO wanted to get involved and thought it would be a good idea to do so as a unit, not individually"
527,"Most (all?) public colleges in the U.S. are primarily funded and wholly governed by the State, but most efforts to achieve free four-year public education focus on the federal government. I am wondering how these proposals affect how public colleges will be governed since the Federal Government would play a much larger role in funding these schools.

Would the Fed take over these public colleges (I am assuming not)? What would the remaining role of states  be in funding public higher ed? Would state governments have less of a say in running these schools? Would schools that refuse to accept certain federal guidelines lose public funds?

I'm not looking for a debate about the merits of free public four-year college, but information about how it would actually be implemented.","State universities already receive significant funding from the federal government through Pell Grants, Stafford Loans, parent PLUS loans, federal work study, the GI Bill, etc. The cheaper a campus, and the lower the income of the community it serves, the more likely it is that most students are using federal funding to pay for most or even all of their tuition, and we don't really see the federal government exerting more control over those schools than they do over higher-tuition flagship universities with a lot of out-of-state and foreign students who aren't using financial aid. So free public college wouldn't necessarily translate into more control, it would depend on how the program was implemented. 

It would be pretty reasonable for the government to put some kind of restrictions on how much universities can increase their tuition if the government is footing the bill, like how Medicare and the VA can set the rates they'll reimburse healthcare providers so they don't bleed them dry. So in that sense, the schools' budgets could be impacted which can obviously translate into a lot of decisions. But state governments and market factors (schools know they can't just like, quadruple their tuition overnight if they don't want to lose all their students) already govern tuition increases, so that wouldn't be a significant change. 

Because most colleges already rely on federal government funding to such a great extent, they're used to cooperating with provisions like non-discrimination laws, staying accredited, Title IX, etc, and their states probably already have similar requirements. So that's not going to change. 

Theoretically, the government could add other requirements to get the money, either up front or over time. But they'd still be governed by the Constitution (so they probably couldn't get away with making restrictions on free speech or assembly a prerequisite for securing funding). And state universities have a fair amount of power to advocate for their own interests. If some random congressman decides they're going to stick an amendment on some budget bill saying that every college needs to add an Icelandic Studies major if they want to keep getting funding, you can bet that every representative with a public college or university in their district (which is pretty much all of them) will be getting calls from administrators, professors, students, the owners of small businesses that serve students, parents, alumni, etc letting them know what the impact would be. Conservatives hate unfunded mandates on state government institutions, and liberals hate restrictions on student rights and academic freedom, so I don't see anything but the most reasonable restrictions getting through."
528,Non-American here.  How does the US primary election work?  What stops a Republican from voting in the Democrats primary just to skewer the results?,"Each state is different. There are *open primaries*, *closed primaries*, and *semi-closed primaries*, and each state usually has one of those three options.

In an open primary, on the day of the election, you get to select one party's ballot and vote in that primary, regardless of your political affiliation status.

In a closed primary, you must be registered with the party ahead of time in order to vote in that party's primary.

Semi-closed is kind of a middle ground between these. If you are affiliated with a party, you can only vote in that party's primary, but unaffiliated voters may select which ballot they want to use.

Almost always, even in an open primary, the thing stopping Republicans from voting in a Democratic primary or vice versa is that by doing so, they give up their voice in their own primary."

The analysis I read/listen to at the time didn't seem to explain why it happened and what the motivations for it were.  At least, the explanations didn't seem that convincing to me.

With the benefit of time, has there been better explanations for how that agreement came about and why both countries were motivated to make it happen?  As I search for articles recently, I'm still not understanding why it happened, and the reasons given still seem too minor to motivate something like this.","It's still probably a little too early to get a lot of good historical scholarship on this. I agree with the basic point of your question that this seemed to be a bit odd and the causes for such an agreement were not immediately clear.

Recently, there were articles saying that Trump removing classified documents would have landed any other person in jail immediately.

The person doesn't matter.  Anything else that happened doesn't matter.  If I understood Watergate better, I could probably come up with a more distanced example.

If it is true that any other person would be jailed on the spot for X, even if they did it by mistake, why is it that former presidents get a pass politically?

Furthermore, what is the legal basis for this?  All I can see is a clear cut case (grouping all former Presidents who engaged in illegal activity) of being above the law.  Why does the system not go after them?  Is there an actual written policy or law that says they cannot be prosecuted?

I just feel like it would make the US seem a lot more trustworthy if it weren't constantly coming up with non-reasons to exempt former presidents (and other powerful people, for that matter) from its own laws.","I believe there is a fear that doing so will start a cycle of politically motivated prosecutions, and resistance to the peaceful transfer power."

534," 

Putin knew he could invade Ukraine and crush Ukraine's so-called ""imperialism"" without Nato getting involved. However was he aware of the fact that countries would go this hard on sanctions?

Also, do you think Putin messed up majorly, or will this tactic do good long run?","Prior to this invasion, sanctions to this degree of severity not only had never been applied before, but there was serious doubt this extent of sanctions would even be reasonably possible. I can't see inside Putin's head, but given the unprecedented scale of these sanctions and the amount of corporate self-sacrifice necessary to achieve them, it's pretty easy to say with confidence that Putin couldn't possibly have expected this much hurt. He knew for sure there would be some sanctions, and that they would be pretty severe, but he definitely didn't expect THIS."
535,"I can't find a single opinion poll on whether Iraqis themselves wanted the US to invade back in 2003. I know Saddam was in power and freedom of expression was stifled. But sometimes there are humanitarian groups who operate underground and are able to conduct surveys. 

Is there anyway to gain insight on how ""welcome"" the invasion was?","""Welcome"" is a strong word. But the historical scholarship has more or less reached the conclusion that immediately after Hussein was deposed, there was an air of hopeful optimism that the US would help rebuild the country. While Hussein had a period where he was an effective if repressive ruler who clearly made the lives of his citizens better, that all but disappeared after he started the disastrous Iran-Iraq War and the economy and society never recovered. 

Opinion polls aren't really the right way to go about this. I'm not sure most American-based polling institutions would even know how to accurately poll Iraqis and account for the varying factors required to get a representative result. Fortunately, we do have good traditional historical primary and secondary sources that suggest Iraqis weren't exactly happy to be conquered, but saw an opportunity in having America and its immense resources ostensibly willing to rebuild the country.

However, whatever goodwill did exist was quickly extinguished as the US made policy mistake after policy mistake over the course of the actual occupation. What should have been a chance to repeat the Germany/Japan magic was instead tapping into the failures of Cuba and the Philippines. The insurgency was not present from day one. It was a reaction to US occupation after it flubbed the chance to get it right.

There are a number of excellent sources on this topic. One of the best ones that I've read is Rajiv Chandrasekaran's *Life in the Emerald City*. It's shorter and more approachable than the ordinary history tome because it was written by a journalist who was in Iraq at the time. It may not have the deep historical dives of Lawrence Wright's *The Looming Tower* or Douglas Little's *American Orientalism* but it has enough detail to make the argument well. The historical evidence here that Bush had better choices on his desk and chose the wrong ones is extremely well documented, so basically any modern history book discussing the Iraq War will make the same basic argument. Just heading to your local library will unearth a lot of other good options."
536,"As I understand it, Alexei Navalny is a political prisoner in Russia. He is a continual thorn in the government's side, particularly Putin's. That's why he's in jail (at least that's what I've been told).

Yet he still writes from jail and gives opinions on things. That doesn't make sense to me. If he's imprisoned for his dissent, why not just keep him incommunicado? 

Or is it that Russia would deny that he's jailed for political reasons, and forcibly shutting him up would undermine that narrative?","You're hitting on it with your final question. The people being ruled, no matter what system, want a certain amount of freedom and consistency in the law. Crack down on those things too hard, and the people will fight back, causing the government to potentially be overthrown and replaced. In democracies this is a pretty basic idea, but it applies to autocracies as well. Freedom is a spectrum, not a binary. 

So by jailing Navalny, Putin's regime benefits from quashing some dissent, but play that hand too hard and it back fires. How much you can do that depends on the regime. Stalin had no problem murdering folks capriciously just for basic disagreement. His immediate successors could not get away with that even within the same political system. Russia's current government is nominally more committed to basic freedoms than the USSR was, which Putin can only go so far in quashing dissent. This appears to be a good example."
537,"The current conflict is usually framed as Russia being upset about the West and that other former soviet countries are becoming ""too western."" From what I understand this is a big part of Putin's appeal in Russia, that he has protected Russia from western influence and promoted Russia's non-westerness. 

But I don't really get what this means though. Is it just the political ties of countries in western Europe? That seems odd because why does it matter where the U.N. or whatever is located? The way it is framed, it sounds like it's some kind of cultural thing. But Russia or Poland or Ukraine seem way more like America culturally than say Japan which is usually considered part of ""the West"" Do people in Russia worry about Asian cultural influence? Is it political? because things like democracy or openness seem like objectively good things. Even if you are a dictator you would never openly say you are against freedom and equality. Is it some kind of sense of lost glory? England is also an unglamorous former empire and they seem to take a kind of self-deprecating pride in that. 

I would really like any input on this if you have anything to say.","\> Is it just the political ties of countries in western Europe? That seems odd because why does it matter where the U.N. or whatever is located?

""The West"" is a phrase that makes a lot of sense if you've read history books talking about how the modern geopolitical understanding has developed. ""The West"" isn't *directly* a shorthand for ""western civilization"" but it's pretty close. The modern understanding of ""the West"" is basically an evolution of folks who have embraced the legacy and tradition of democracy, starting in Athens, heading through Rome, towards Enlightenment Europe and political structures that embraced those values. 

So basically, it includes all the countries that have their basis in democracy stemming from the Enlightenment or want to do that. The US and western Europe are obviously thought leaders in this coalition, especially the major powers like the US, UK, France, and Germany. Obviously a country like Canada--based on UK political principles and friends with other Western countries and geographically in the heart of the west--is a part, too. The EU and especially NATO, also is largely committed to those values, so a country like Poland that has a bit of history going both ways but has recently been committed to NATO and the EU, would also be pretty clearly Western. 

But what if a country like Turkey joined the EU? There are very few cultural connections between Turkey and most of the heart of the West. Ethnically it's the same story. Even from a geographical perspective, they're not very ""west"" at all, and the values of the political system aren't fully in alignment with traditional western values. But if they joined EU, that's very clearly binding them to the West, so how much does that matter? A country like Israel shares many of those same concerns, but they're clearly part of the West as well. Countries like Ukraine and Moldova and Georgia are also traditionally not really aligned with the West but here they are wanting to join the EU...so at what point have you crossed the tipping point into being Western? It's not entirely clear.

\> But Russia or Poland or Ukraine seem way more like America culturally than say Japan which is usually considered part of ""the West""

Japan's a bit unusual. Japan is a part of the West for two reasons. One, looking back pretty far in history, Japan was notably more imperialistic and friendly to Western countries than the rest of the continent. Literally, Japan sought to be known as the ""white"" people of Asia back in the late 1800s when white, Western colonialism was seen as a good thing. But far more importantly, after Japan lost WW2 their whole political system was rebuilt from the ground up with help from the American occupation, so their government is based on Western principles in a way the rest of Asia isn't. That alliance has persisted since then as well, so just makes sense to consider Japan as part of the West.

\> Do people in Russia worry about Asian cultural influence?

Japan and Russia actually border one another on Russia's eastern border. They have gone to war before. Teddy Roosevelt won a Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating peace between them in 1900ish. So now that Japan is part of the West, Russia is probably concerned about D) all of the above in terms of Japan.

\> because things like democracy or openness seem like objectively good things. Even if you are a dictator you would never openly say you are against freedom and equality.

Yes, but these things are always a spectrum, not a binary. Think about it this way. Getting promoted at work is objectively a good thing, but it can still come with negative aspects. More responsibility, more accountability, change in role, no longer doing some stuff you liked about your job, etc. True, you'll pretty much always take the promotion because more pay is the thing that matters the most, and if a boss tried to say you don't want a promotion/raise because it comes with those bad things you'd tell that boss to shove it, but the point is *good thing can have bad aspects*.

So yeah, dictators don't say democracy is bad...but they do say that democracy comes with other bad things like anxiety, depression, social fragmentation, inefficiency, etc. The point of a dictator is to find a way to give the minimum amount of freedom/equality/democracy/etc and they do that by emphasizing how giving those things is a double-edged sword. Putin pushing against the West is done to undermine the West's commitment to those values by ""exposing"" the flaws in those values."
538,"Also why did that specific region come to have such pro-Russian, pro-Soviet politics, why has it continued to exist being as it is such a small and isolated area, and why has it not been a site of conflict in the present Russia-Ukraine War?

539,"Both when I was in graduate school in an International Studies program and while reading more broadly in foreign policy-oriented publications like foreign affairs, there has consistently been a focus on the normative idea that what's best for the world is an American-led world order, specifically a ""liberal democratic"" world order. 

Most of the policy wonks involved in these discussions take it as a given that a free market approach is an essential tenet of this and there is a tacit belief that what amounts to laissez-faire economics is best for America, and therefore best for the world in the context of a liberal-democratic world order. 

Trump-era protectionism was obviously viewed as a threat to this because it placed restrictions on the ""free market"" (and this continues in Biden's appeals to consumer nationalism in the recent SOTU address). This leaves the question of how a transition to norms that focused on social democracy and the promotion of a welfare state + mixed-market economy would fare if these were to be switched out in such discussions with the notion of a ""liberal world order"" focused on the promotion of free market values and free trade. 

Would this substantively change the ideas being promoted, as well as America's role and the nature of the American-led liberal world order that is held up as the optimum in mainstream/orthodox foreign policy circles?","I see no reason why international liberalism and social democracy cannot coexist. My glimpse into this balance came during the 2020 Democratic Primaries. When asked a question about trade, Sen. Warren replied that she wanted ""unions at the table, environmentalists at the table, small businesses at the table."" I imagine that social democrats would have little problem with trade, so long as labor and environmental standards are met. 

While a social democratic world order may not include perfectly free trade, there's no reason why it wouldn't uphold the liberal principles of reciprocity and common identity, of institutionalism. Because social democracy has an inherently economic focus, that makes it rather adaptable to other ideologies on non-economic issues."
540,is it possible for someone to run as a dictator and be elected by the united states citizens?,"Is it possible for you to ask someone's permission to steal their stuff?

This is kind of the same problem. These are contradictions in terms. If they give you permission, it isn't really stealing, and if you're going to steal, why do you need permission?

Dictators aren't elected. If you're elected, then you're only a dictator if you stay in office even when you're not elected, which means no, a dictator can't be elected. Also why would someone run for office if they're going to be a dictator? What's the point of going through a campaign if you're just going to ignore the election process anyway?"

543,"Japan is well known for having basically a 1 party system. While there is opposition it has no real chance of gaining power. Despite this Japan ranks very highly in terms of most metrics, including having a fairly liberal and open society. Most states that have a single party exerting absolute control (like Turkey, or Isreal ) have seen a lot of democratic backsliding over the last few years. But Japan which has been under one-party rule for a lot longer is basically doing fine. Now I'm sure there are many problems in Japan both political and economic. But compared to all the countries in the world Japan still decidedly sits in the upper echelon of liberal and successful states? Why has Japan managed to stay so free and productive despite its uncompetitiveness?","The LDP is a bit of a different breed from most parties in that historically its often operated more as a conglomerate of parties instead of being one unified group.  The LDP was made up of numerous factions that all had their own ideologies, platform, and campaign workers and thus were basically parties within parties.  This has changed a bit due Koizumi-era empowering the LDP leader but even now the LDP is an extremely broad ""big tent"" party with no real comparable parties anywhere else and more comparable to coalition groups.  What this means is that elections were still competitive, but they were often between LDP members and not other parties.  Koizumi infamously lead the LDP to its largest electoral victory in the 2000s, while pretty much running on a ""anti-LDP"" platform as the whole election ended up being a war between the ""reformers"" and the ""traditional"" members of the LDP.  

What this also leads to is a single-party state where the party institutionally is comically weak historically.  You don't see the LDP swarming around a single leader or group, and historically the PM/Party Leader was more of a compromise candidate that all the factions approved of and acted as a good face of the party.  That position was a bit stronger under Koizumi and Abe, due to the fact those two were shockingly popular and lead to massive electoral victories, but generally most power is concentrated in local factions and clans that due most of the work and often will due their own thing.  This has prevented a real strong-man from taking control of the party, which is something that often happens in other single party states, and instead lead to a history of ""revolving door"" leadership that didn't end until Abe figured out the magical recipe for keeping your PM job in modern day Japan."

Did this put Russia in a more advantageous position to invade Ukraine? What impact would these sanctions have had?","Sanctions tend to bolster the power of autocratic regimes rather than harm them.

Sanctions never really hurt the elites in such nations, who take their cut of the pie before anyone else. No matter how bad it gets in Russia, Putin is still going to have food on the table and a roof over his head. Their major impact is to hurt the middle class and drive them into poverty - and dependence on the regime. Since the power base for authoritarian governments is the dependent underclass, this generally means they sell a narrative of an outside enemy that must be united against and the (now impoverished) people don't have much choice except to follow along.

Sanctions also reduce commerce, meaning that the average citizen has less direct contact with information from the outside world. In most cases, this means they're getting less accurate information and in virtually all cases, it means they're getting information biased against those from the outside world."
548,Was there any reason? Does anyone know how they came to their decision?,"So each politician has their own reasons that we may never know for their endorsements. But we can review the media at the time and make some assumptions and conclusions.

John Kerry ran in 2004 with John Edwards as the VP. So when Kerry endorsed Obama, it was seen as a slap in the face of Edwards, not Clinton. Kerry, at least publicly, seemed to somewhat endorse the ""dark horse"" mentality of Obama's 2008 campaign. He wasn't an entrenched politician and was to the left of Clinton, both things Kerry seemed to hit on at the time.

Ted Kennedy has apparently always favored the younger up-and-comers rather than the status quo presidents (like someone he was related to). Kennedy was also very supportive of Obama backing his failed immigration bill while in the Senate. These two factors influence Kennedy to support Obama over Clinton, with whom he'd made connections with during Bill Clinton's time in office."
549,"I'm wondering how a ceremonial presidency would operate in Britain compared to the current monarchy. Whether it's a president directly elected like Ireland's, or one chosen indirectly like Germany. What would it look like? And would it be better than what already exists?","The [monarchy](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/has-the-queen-done-a-good-job-during-her-time-on-the-throne) is generally much more popular than [the sitting government](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/government-approval), and retaining the monarchy is [supported across party lines](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/zzfjr9fmfc/Attitudes%20to%20monarchy%202021.pdf). The main drawback, therefore, is taking a portfolio of powers and responsibilities from a fairly trusted and respected institution, and handing it over to a political system that lacks a lot of public trust and confidence.

However, sufficient levels of scandal could change the dynamic; Elizabeth is more popular herself than the monarchy as an abstract proposition. Without that, however, I think cultural inertia will stave off republicanism for quite some time (only the very youngest generation is republican).

As for the exact method, the [Commonwealth of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Britain_Bill) proposal called for a president jointly elected by the House of Commons and a House of Lords reconfigured as a democratic upper house; I think that a joint election is the likely form. The UK manages to elect Speakers of the House (a similarly non-partisan position with some political power); it would not be too difficult a feat to do the same with a President."

The people who have direct control over SWIFT are it’s executive team, who are appointed by its board of directors. But they have to comply with the laws of all of the countries it operates in. In practice this means that US and EU law have the most influence over the decisions the executive team makes."

For example, I approved a post regarding questions on SWIFT that did not specifically ask a question related to the Russian invasion or sanctions.","Has Russia chosen a very bad time to start the invasion?:

* They let the world see this coming for weeks beforehand, instead of doing a surprise attack.
* The invasion is at the end of the Northern Hemisphere winter. Wouldn't it be more effective to start the invasion in late autumn, so that they can shut off oil and gas to Europe, and make Europeans freeze to death in retaliation for opposing the invasion?
* They could have chosen to attack when the COVID-19 pandemic was crippling Europe, instead of now when Europe is mostly vaccinated."

Nuclear weapons and the threat thereof are generally more useful in a negotiation context and to deter attack by conventional forces. As such, it's much better to *have* them and not use them because you can use the *threat* of them over and over again (a la North Korea) but you can't un-detonate a nuclear device.

In a last-ditch defense effort to resist the advance of a conventional military the leadership of a nuclear capable power might consider utilizing nuclear weapons against the invaders, perhaps hoping to damage their forces enough to survive the onslaught or even just as a final middle finger to the invading nation.

Even that is....a stretch. 

The use of nuclear weapons is not something that any nation takes lightly and doing so raises the potential of an in kind response from other nations or from a dramatic shift in opinion about the war itself.

Plus there's just the fact that most people, even leaders, are not sociopathic enough to consider a suicide run with a nuclear weapon worth exploring seriously."
556,"While Somaliland and Puntland are considered by all countries to be part of Somalia, they are de facto separate nations. Not only that, they're also richer, safer and more democratic than Somalia.

Compare with similar cases around the world:

* Some countries recognise Palestine, but others don't because they value an alliance with Israel.

* Few countries recognise the Donetsk and Luhansk breakaway republics, and those which do are staunch allies of Russia and unfriendly with the West.

In contrast, what have we got to lose from pissing off Somalia? Considering that Somaliland and Puntland are richer than Somalia, wouldn't there be an economic advantage to recognising them? Many nations already patrol Somalia's coast with warships because Somalia can't keep piracy under control - correct me if I'm wrong but recognising Somaliland and Puntland wouldn't worsen the piracy problem. It's not like Somalia is a military threat to anyone or has an economy strong enough to economically hurt us if we recognise Somaliland and Puntland.","Countries generally do not support independence movements within other nations because it can bolden similar movements in other countries, specifically any in their own."
557,I don't really understand their role.  Thank you for explaining.,"It's less about holding onto money as it is holding onto power.

The oligarchs are Putin's key supporters, they provide funding and support for him and his government in exchange for favor with Putin. They also control large sections of the Russian economy as well as the media.

Money is part of it but less on the individual level and more on the state level. Putin himself is a very wealthy person in his own right but when you're talking about money on a state level, it's nice to have a bunch of billionaires who support you and can cut you a check in exchange for some cherry opportunities later on.

Individually, the oligarchs aren't as strong but together they represent a significant power base that Putin depends on to stay in power.

559,"Was told by an ask historians mod that I should post my question here.

For example, let's say there's a huge kingdom, however the King dies. The 3 princes end up fighting over the throne, resulting in three different factions fighting each other within the kingdom . I don't think this can be considered a coup, and definitely not a secession since no new states have actually been formed.","Dissolution. Here's a real world example:

560,"Are there any authors or works that explore a defense of a more conservative liberalism that does not rely on natural rights (as Locke did) or advance an abstract societal blueprint (as Rawls did), such as the utilitarian approach of J. S. Mill (non-natural rights derived from the harm/utility principles and institutions/policies sensitive to concrete circumstances), while at the same time explicitly stressing a precautionary skepticism regarding the use of abstract reasoning or rationalism in politics to avoid the dangerous radicalisms that such systems promote if not applied conservatively (as seen in Burke's brand of traditionalism)?

While it doesn't need to be specifically a utilitarian approach, that seems to be the most common alternative to a defense of liberalism. Coleridge's romanticism influenced Mill's utilitarian liberalism to theoretically be more historically sensitive than Bentham's, but in practice he continued to advocate for similarly profound and radical institutional changes. Sidgwick seems to be the only major utilitarian in the conservative tradition, but I can't find much on his political views aside from economics, not to mention contradicting sources pointing towards him not being so conservative after all.

Liberalism is the dominant political philosophy in the western world, but there seems to be a surprising lack of diversity of non-natural rights-based approaches, in particular a branch of such a liberalism that avoids radical institutional changes in favor of more gradual reform, as I expected utilitarian empiricists (also associated with skepticism) to gravitate towards.

If this is an unreasonably specific request, I would appreciate recommendations of more material that addresses individual elements of what I have mentioned, even if it doesn't include all of them.

Note: For clarity, I started this search when reading SEP's article on Conservatism, which claimed Sidgwick to use somewhat Millian-Liberal principles to arrive at somewhat Burkean-conservative conclusions (which striked me as a surprisingly harmoneous synthesis, in theory).","In a political theory class we spent a whole day on the justification of rights. The third one we came up with (which I suggested) was that people having rights was beneficial for the economy, for happiness and for maintaining order. When people are free, they have little need to revolt, and their freedom grants prosperity unfamiliar to those of command economies."
561,"I know that USA has a list of State Sponsors of Terrorism, but I'm wondering if any country has ever gone one step further by directly adding some national government or its ruling party to the list of terrorist organisations? Most of the world did that to ISIS, Ukraine did that to Donbass separatists, but I can't remember any governments of internationally recognised countries getting this status. What would be the consequences of such an action? Would it be akin to a declaration of war?","The idea that ""terrorist"" is one of the worst things you can call someone in international relations is relatively new, dating back to September 11, 2001. Historically, being a warmonger would have been worse. A terrorist just kills a few people, while a warmonger triggers wars that kill millions. It's only because we had a period of relative calm in terms of state-to-state conflict in the late 20th century that terrorism became the main boogeyman.

It's true that Putin is a reprehensible despot.  But what did we and Ukraine gain by not agreeing to bar NATO admittance to Russia's next-door neighbor?  Both Putin and the US knew that if push came to shove, we would pull out our ""Hope the Ukrainians are doing OK"" sentiments while Russia did what it does best.  Send human misery to create more human misery.  We now are losing an ally next door while Russia gains a puppet state. Why isn't NATO big enough to placate both USA's and Russia's insecurities?  Why wasn't this a diplomacy no-brainer?","To force Ukraine to give up the choice of ever joining NATO would violate the sovereignty principle, that a country should be free to manage its own affairs, including what international organizations and military alliances it may join. The sovereignty principle is more important than Putin's anxieties of a possible NATO member on Russia's western border. Sovereignty is such a fundamental pillar of how we define countries that the US, itself a violator of the principle at times, has an obligation to defend it.

I remember watching the news in 2014, when masses of Ukrainians marched in the streets to protest Russian interference in its government and the end of EU membership talks.

Constantly you hear of leaders ""having talks"" behind closed doors. For example leader XYZ going to White house and having a talk with the American President. Or recently Macron going to Russia to speak to Putin.

My main question is: Do they really actually talk? Besides the language barrier, how do they guarantee that the room isn't simply monitored/taped? I imagine lots of this talk is controversial, imagine for example if Putin leaked the talk video/audio to the world and you found out that Macron promised parts of Ukraine if Putin stopped his main invasion/threats.

Basically, how is it possible for two leaders to talk openly, and not worry about the audio/video leaking to the public? In a world where you can easily tape any room with near invisible microphones/cameras. A leaked talk could be a big blackmail option for a leader against another.

Also, when a leader has a videocall, like Putin & Biden just had, over a screen, like a Skype call...Is that bull\*\*\*\* for the public or do you think they really are having a video call?","They really have all these calls. Some of them are just ""for show"" or only hit a few main points, but there are plenty of calls that are more in the weeds. Every single call has dozens of people on both sides, listening, recording, and taking notes. Both leaders work with teams on exactly what they're going to say, and how they'll respond to the other party. 

If they need a translator, they'll use one. Some in person meetings don't have recordings, but almost certainly every phone call does. They're not worried about leaks because the people who have access to recordings are often the most trusted team working directly for the head of state. A lot of calls have official transcripts released."

568,I'm confused as to what is being called an invasion now. Is this one? Has the war officially begun?,"In the shortest answer to most people, yes. Russia has invaded Ukraine. 

The longer answer to it has a few different angles. 

From Russia's official position, what they have done is recognise independent breakaway states from Ukraine. And now with these independent states, he is moving in 'peacekeeping' forces. So his argument would be, at least officially, would be that he has still not invaded Ukraine - instead two parts of the country have seceded and are independent, and have allowed him to put his troops on the ground as peacekeepers. Thus in his argument, it's not Ukraine and he's not invading. 

For basically everyone else, the territory is officially still Ukraine, and Putin has officially moved his forces across that line - hence an invasion. To them, the land is still Ukraine. And the 'peacekeepers' are still Russian military forces. Thus to them, hard to call it anything else but an invasion. 

The asterisk on has the war officially begun, arguably it began a long time ago but this is a dramatic shift. That asterisk being that there has been armed conflict in the East for quite some time in which officially only Russian 'volunteers' with Russian provided equipment were actively engaged. This was a bit of a flow on what Russia admitted but basically started with no involvement, to Russian volunteers only, to official material support, to wink-nod confession. In that sense, Russia already had troops on Ukrainian soil, but not officially and never to this scale."

Ultimately, to answer your question more directly, he could have prioritized investments in NATO countries closest to Ukraine, such as Romania and Poland, without alienating the rest of NATO or insulting them by repeatedly threatening to pull out of the alliance.

579,"I was wondering this since I've been following the libertarian subreddit out of curiosity for the past while (I also follow communism and everything else pretty much out of curiosity), and I realised it seems to support a very strong shift towards a much more open form of capitalism... 

My question is whether ""Libertarianism"" as a term is just an overarching generalised construct of everything characterising an open and free economic market, with very little - if any - government intervention? 

I assume this is the case seeing as ""capitalism"" doesn't really represent a socially constructed identity as well as socialism does, even if there are collectivist terms for it (Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, etc.).

Just asking out of curiosity, thanks guys!","Besides endorsing an extreme form of free market capitalism (very different from what Adam Smith or the vast majority of pro-capitalist economists would endorse) Libertarianism comes out of the Utilitarian Neo-Classical Economic tradition (eg John Stuart Mill.) 

Before Mill, Utilitarians tried to calculate the greatest good for the greatest number using units like Hedons (pleasure) and Dolors (pain, displeasure). But the problem was that those units are so subjective that it’s impossible, or at least wildly impractical, to measure them.

Mills solution was [preference utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism) — instead of maximizing Hedons, you maximize preference — and free markets maximize preference. And you can accurately calculate how to maximize preferences using [indifference curves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indifferencecurve.asp). These insights are what separates neo-classical economics from classical economics.

But anyway, Libertarinism also draws from this tradition. Not only do they see the economy as an engine to maximize preferences, but there’s a ethical aspect as well, where preferences are the only good by which all other goods are measured."

584,"Hey guys! I'm a teen and I started using Reddit recently starting in March 2021 (with another account). And I've noticed that after browsing r/politics I've become a lot more angry/jaded/cynical and drifted much farther to the left, from not really caring about politics but passively supporting Biden to being a full on Bernie supporter.

I also have had much more hostile opinions towards Conservatives in general recently. It's actually started impacting my personal life too and my parents have remarked about how I spend way more time in my room then I did before and seem more angry (they don't know I have Reddit btw).

So I'm making a new rule for myself that after this post I going to stop reading about politics on Reddit and focus on the subs that are about my interests. However my question is, are Reddit politics making me angry because it's really that bad and I was just seeing the truth (ie an ""ignorance is bliss"" situation). Or does Reddit make it seem worse then it really is? Or should I actually be more concerned then I already am?

And yes, I am aware of the irony of posting this on Reddit. But I don't really have another avenue of asking this so...","No, they're not accurate.  It also depends which particular kind of 'accuracy' you're talking about; as there's a difference between the kind of articles that are posted, what represents the median voter, and what the users say.

In general, reddit leans very strongly left.  It also leans progressive, and has a much younger userbase than the voterbase.  Iirc it also trends whiter and more male, more educated, and more affluent.

Individual subreddits can of course vary wildly.

R politics is generally regarded as being garbage (at least amongst the people I know from several subs).  The articles posted there are generally at least technically correct, but sometimes misleading, and the overall selection of what gets posted is highly biased.  The comment sections are useless and highly biased.

The phenomenon of rage/anger at a group due to media exposure (including social media) is well known.  Fortunately there's also strong evidence that as long as you stick to your plan of discontinuing reading about politics on reddit you'll turn back to normal.

585,"I’m researching the late 19th century and there’s plenty of precedent that could lead to some messed up stuff if you know how to exploit it.

I don’t just mean Roe v Wade, I mean civil liberties strengthened after FDR confronted the court and the civil rights era. (The civil rights act of the 1870s was declared illegal by the courts) Frankly the more I research the Supreme Court, the more I lose faith in it and am wondering if there are not already plans in place to take things to their logical extremes.

586,"I don't follow news much, but I am constantly hearing references to ""Lawlesness"" being talked about on Fox when I visit my parents place. They never really go into much detail. I was planning a trip to Chicago with my wife and daughter in December and my parents were both flipping out like I was going to a war zone. What is all this in reference to? I can see theres some increases in crime in certain areas but that just seems far from the ""anarchy"" vibe I'm getting from political sources. 

Am I missing something or is this being blown up for political reasons?","NYC guy here. Here’s what I consider a very honest answer: it’s a little worse than it used to be, but it’s nowhere near as bad as Fox News and other conservative outlets make it.

The details: homelessness is definitely up, and that’s due to a few factors, but a lot of it is Covid. Shelters and hospitals had to accept fewer people because of spacing issues, and with homelessness being up, there is more public drug use and more public ruination (I’ve seen to twice—I never used to see that). That sort of thing is always in cities—part of the charm of city life—but it is definitely more than usual. 

In terms of safety, most neighborhoods are about the same, but it seems like rougher neighborhoods got a little rougher. My wife and I still bring our kiddo to the park, get on subways, etc. Life as usual. 

What is definitely up, though, is my parents asking me how I can live in a war zone. Their concerns don’t match my reality in any way. I think conservative media outlets try to paint city life as anarchy because cities tend to embrace more liberal policies, which tend to work well in larger cities. 

That’s my take. Other cities may be different, but we have family is SF, and it seems to be the same out there. A little rougher, mostly due to Covid, but not nearly as bad as many outlets say it is."

This isn't a joke I'm serious this had to of happened at some point in history.","Yes. The Romans had three legislative bodies that did not necessarily have to agree with one another to create laws.

The *Assembly of the Centuries* was dominated by wealthy men.

The *Senate* was deminated by wealthy men from aristocratic families who had served public office.

The *Tribal Assembly* was dominated by the common people of Italia.

Generally, the Senate was the most power of these three institutions, having the power to legislative over nearly all matters. There were a few subjects that were reserved to the other bodies, though. For example, Roman Elections were mostly a matter that was dealt with by the *Centuries*, while the *Tribal Assembly* mostly dealt with law related to common people.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, we don't know *exactly* how these branches of the legislative interacted with each other as the texts are lost to time, but we do know that each law did not explictly require permission from every branch.

A good way to imagine this is like how the US Senate can legislate on treaties, without the approval of the House of Representatives."

My question is the following:
Did Putin underestimate the west's capacity to give in to his demands? Did he wrongly assume the west will listen to him, and in turn force himself into a conflict he hoped could be avoided with westeen concession?",">What would happen internally in Russia if Putin pulls back his troops?

Same thing that happened during the 2018 buildup, or the 2021 buildup... nothing. This is by far not the first Russian buildup on Ukraine's border. 

Putin doesn't need to invade to accomplish his goals. All he has to do is do a buildup on Ukraine's borders every few years and that will probably be enough politically to permanently keep Ukraine from joining NATO.

I remember after that, there was this rhetoric of ""this is unacceptable, period."" But the constitution allows this, right, supposedly we are meant to overthrow corrupt governments? 

So let's assume it were democrats trying to storm the capitol to oust Trump from an attempted coup - wouldn't that be a good reason? Or would that be seen as unruly and unnecessary? (And this isn't a democrat vs republican question, replace parties where necessary if the president were a democrat.)","Either we are a nation of laws or we aren't, and if we aren't then a Jan 6 type event would be the least of our worries.  We have laws and systems in place to address our grievances with government; there's no clause in the constitution that allows citizens to just overthrow a government they don't like.  Having said that, I'd like to point out that you can dislike the outcome of a political process as much as you want but *disagreeing* with the outcome of a political process is not a legitimate grievance and you (singular) have no \*legal\* recourse other than voting.  If the republicans thought the 2020 election was fraudulent (spoiler - it wasn't, and its a completely disingenuous argument anyway) there are legal channels to investigate processes and results and while they never mentioned that on Fox (*quelle surprise*) those challenges did happen and the results were confirmed multiple times.  Sending a horde of misinformed reactionaries to 'protest' (that term is used generously here) is a terrible idea.    None of the Jan 6 insurrectionists had a clue as to what actually happened, and in this case it is absolutely unacceptable to attack your fellow citizens, destroy public property, or enact violence in order to effect your desired political change.

If Trump had somehow remained in office illegitimately (lol 'green bay sweep') I do not believe the capitol would have been overrun by some imaginary cabal of leftist antifa troublemakers; thats not how the left typically operates.  The far right loves to fantasize about their absurd civil war on the 100% made-up ""DeEp StAtE"" but the 2A types are going to be very unpleasantly surprised when it turns out their gun fetish absolutely does not save them from a supposed tyrannical federal government.  Not only is the right using guns as a wedge issue to stoke the culture war, they are taking your rights away legally using the very political process they love to decry.  If the federal government really was tyrannical, they would have no issues dropping a few dozen drone strikes on any actual insurrectionists, no matter how many AR15s they are clutching.

I encourage all Americans to travel outside of North America.

Usually, they argue that the United States was founded by Christians who explicitly drew on Christianity to justify the establishment of the country and constructed the American form of government based on ""Christian values""

That's not total B.S. but it's way more complicated than that. The United States was not created by one totally homogenous group of people. The ""founding fathers"" were hundreds if not 1,000s of people who contributed to the legal foundations of the American government, who all had very different philosophical, religious, and political ideas. Most were Christian but not all, and many were non-conforming Christians who had beliefs few on the contemporary Christian right would recognize. Religion and God-centered philosophies were a big deal for many of these people but not for all, and some explicitly wanted the government to be secular."
592,"This question is inspired by u/polymatter's video [Why Sanctions Don't Work Against North Korea](https://www.reddit.com/r/PolyMatter/comments/skgmjm/why_sanctions_dont_work_against_north_korea/). In it, he brings up that from Kim Jong-Un's POV, [nukes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction) are a necessity to protect himself from regime change, or else he might end up like Gaddafi. 

This leads me to wonder: how has Cuba, another heavily-sanctioned single party state, preserved its regime without having nukes?

* Cuba has a higher [HDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) and [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) than North Korea. If North Korea can afford to develop nukes, so can Cuba. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there is no indication that Cuba has secret nukes.
* The USA has a long-established [military foothold on the Cuban main island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guantanamo_Bay_Naval_Base), from which it can easily launch an invasion.
* Countries friendly to Cuba (e.g. Venezuela, Russia, PRC, Iran, Belarus) have little to no capability to protect Cuba from an American invasion. Correct me if I'm wrong, but present-day Russia does not have an explicit threat that it will launch its nukes if the USA invades Cuba.
* Cubans have more awareness of the outside world than North Koreans, due to less restrictive travel and citizenship laws. Up to [200,000 Cubans are eligible for Spanish citizenship alone](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-spain-citizenship-idUSTRE51502U20090206).","By avoiding conflict and maintaining a local power basis. If Cuba would do what North Korea does in terms of dealing in anything illegal it would be invaded. But by avoiding conflict over these types of things they're quite safe from being invaded. They can't develop nukes however, America would never allow it in their sphere of influence.

Both governments can only negotiate about sanctions if they're willing to give in to demands designed to erode their power base. Both would be way better off if they had nukes, because then they could negotiate about something other than their grip on power. Kim Jong-Un can't afford diplomacy without it because his local power base is completly build around the military and the fear of a foreign invasion, while in Cubas it isn't. That's the reason Kim Jong-Un needs nukes so bad. But he's on thin ice because Russia and China don't necessarily like him becoming too powerful (dangerous)."

Does this statement refer only to winning an election, which Trump believes he did in 2020, or both winning an election *and* being sworn into office?

It would refer to only ACTUALLY winning an election. The process of the 2020 election happened, and Biden was sworn in. So Trump (by any legal and political definition) was not elected President in 2020. Trump can claim he won all he wants, but if it was litigated his attorneys would almost assuredly agree he WASN'T elected and his statements are more politics.

>If it's the latter, doesn't that mean Trump must concede in order to be eligible for reelection in 2024 according to the 22A?

Now that things are getting back to normal, demand has skyrocketed, a large part of the supply chain problem.  I have heard (can someone confirm) that we have imported more goods than ever before, but demand is even higher.","There was more demand partly because people had more money, partly because of pent up demand.

I am a also huge fan of u/polymatter, and he made a video called [Why China Sucks at Soft Power — China's Reckoning (Part 4)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y87R3Lp0jd0) about how the PRC's wolf warrior diplomacy is burning its bridges and destroying its own reputation.

However, I myself had the impression that the PRC uses un-diplomatic language because it's strong enough to not need to restrain itself? After all, the PRC managed to use foreign investment to make the majority of the world [support its oppression of Uyghurs](https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sizes/large/thediplomat-2020-10-08.png) and [its territorial claims](https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/thediplomat_2016-07-27_14-05-18.png). If a country has managed to become as powerful and widely supported as the PRC, why would it need to worry about toning down its insults?

On a similar note, [Joe Biden himself has said that](https://youtu.be/tM4NaTdzYio?t=81):

>Xi Jinping and other autocrats think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century with autocracies, because it takes too long to get consensus. We're in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st century. We're at a great inflection point in history.

Point is, the President of the United States himself sounds very desperate. Aside from this being quite worrying for me, maybe it goes to show that the PRC uses wolf warrior diplomacy because they're too strong to need to worry about the countries opposing them?

On a side note, French political scientist [Emmanuel Todd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Todd) successfully predicted the USSR's collapse, and [is predicting that the USA will become weak, unpopular and isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Empire).

>Myanmar is on the brink of collapse. One year after the coup, half the population does not have enough food. The local currency has lost 50% of its value. Foreign companies are pulling out of Myanmar. The military is shooting civilians in the streets and opponents of the military are carrying out bombings and assassinations.

So what is causing this food shortage? It's not like a foreign power sprayed them with [Agent Orange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange) or used bioweapons to kill their crops.

Or does Myanmar simply have more people than what it could feed without imports?","In very very simplified terms, the vast majority of it isn't food shortages exactly but rather a collapsing economy in which a broader band of the population no longer has access to affordable food. 

Food insecurity was already somewhat of an issue as it was in Myanmar, so it's not necessarily as if this came out of nowhere. But with the coup, a lot of industry, manufacturing, and very importantly banking came to a near total halt. A lot of Burmese are unable to access their money and many just don't have any now due to lost wages (either through unemployment from their industries shuttering or otherwise reduced). They're then unable to access food and are cutting back or going hungry. Farms are also struggling with access to capital to keep running, especially on tight harvests.

To lesser but still important, there's also dyamics of reduced foreign investment, contractions on trade (and with even the trade still going on limited by reduced capacity on supply chain process), rising prices of staple goods, etc. 

But the core of it is that the entire economy has been both in freefall and shuttered in large part, sending a larger band of the population into poverty levels that fall below the threshold of being able to afford food."

For my final year dissertation I’m considering the extent of the collaboration between the GOP party and NRA, if one even exists, and wanted to get some other peoples views on the whole situation! 

There are a few instances in which the NRA has utilised its lobbying efforts towards Republican candidates - whether this is because they seem to embody the NRA’s principles on gun rights more so than the Democrats, is something up for discussion - but there are also instances in which the tables have been turned and the NRA has lobbied for the dems and against the GOP. 

This is only a small instance in which the question seems misleading because there isn’t always this expected harmony between the two organisations as many people anticipate. 

There are situations  in which pro- NRA & gun rights presidents like Reagan, once out of the political eye, change their attitudes towards gun control (e.g. Reagan supporting the 1993 Brady Bill - could be a ‘special instance’ because it was something close to home for him). 

But just wanted to know if there were any instances in which you guys think portrays an accurate depiction of the two organisations working alongside one another or not! Bonus points if anyone has any information on situations in which the NRA has essentially been able to veto gun control legislation through the argument such legislation will infringe on their second amendment rights!","> There are a few instances in which the NRA has utilised its lobbying efforts towards Republican candidates

602,"Most people don't realize how dependent we are on Taiwan for microchips that power just about any electronics we have, and how incredibly disastrous it would be if the supply of chips from Taiwan stopped. If China moves to invade Taiwan, there are really two options-- either the US and global community fights back, or they take the approach they're taking to Russia invading Ukraine (sanctions and weapon sales but no direct conflict). What happens to the microchip supply in each of these situations? If China took over Taiwan, would they stop selling chips to the US, or would they continue to sell them simply because they want the revenue the chips provide?","Taiwan absolutely would go scorched earth for microchip production, not allowing China to produce chips. There are already rumors of major plants being rigged to blow important components.

On the eve of an invasion Taiwan would basically remind the world they can either defend them or have massive microchips shortages for at least 5 years while domestic plants are brought online. As a bonus, China wouldn’t be able to produce as much electronics and thus would have a massive GDP decline even without boycotts/sanctions."

604,"I have heard of this and intuitively, it does make sense because globalisation allows countries to influence each other, but I am curious if it is verified whether outside influence indeed led Saudi Arabia to their liberalisation?

Yes, continuing trade with a corrupt government is argued to being complicit to their crime, but from what has been seen thus far, is that it is the people who are hurt more by sanctions than the political elites who are easily insulated from the consequences.","As I understand it, the US-Saudi relationship has more to do with Israel.

European nationalism is looked back upon as a glorious age when the people of Europe threw off the feudal yoke of foreign monarchs, and European ethnic groups fully embraced their right to self determination. But in modern times nationalism (called tribalism by westerners and western-aligned Africans) is treated as a taboo only for black Africans as inherently wrong or dangerous.

609,"I don't know why, but I keep going in my mind back to the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries and thinking about the moments that stuck with me the most.

Maybe it's my memory, but healthcare seemed to be the issue that defined candidates the most and showed each on a unique part of a spectrum.

It went from Medicare to All to Medicare as an option to improving ObamaCare. 

And even within Medicare for All, there were those very pivotal moments between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in which they debated whether taxes would go up or not. Sanders conceded taxes would go up but that overall costs would go down. Warren seemed terrified to be forced into a position that she both didn't want to admit to and also didn't want to be held to if she became president, and I think it really hurt her a lot. She refused to answer the question.

And now a couple of years later I have to think: What did any of that debate matter whatsoever? The Democrats can't do much of anything with healthcare.

Even Trump who in the primary changed the nature of the Republican party and got so many Republicans to pledge fealty to him failed to accomplish so many of the goals of his movement (building a wall, for example). If you look at what he actually did in terms of policy, it was tax cuts and conservative supreme court nominees. 

Have presidential primaries always been political theatre? I am wondering how much to care moving forward about the individual policies that are proposed when the political realities seem to lie in Congress.","This is one of the chief arguments AGAINST primaries, actually. There's a reason other democracies don't use them like we have in the US. I've said it time and time again: primaries are NOT for the general population. They are matters of internal governance for committed members of that given party for just this reason. Primaries are a reasonably decent mechanic when they are seen from the right perspective. When they become a national discussion throughout the entire electorate, then primaries are actually detrimental to the process."

Even accepting your hypothetical of a country where you could ban a group from doing so, how could you prevent something like the leader of that group saying, ""hey, in my personal capacity, I just think Congressman ____ seems like she really supports a lot of the causes I do,"" which then is basically a wink-wink nod-nod endorsement.

If it is truly just an exercise, why hold it there of all places, fully aware of the tension it will cause?  
Following up, it seems like common sense that military drills near a border *always* have ulterior motives, or they'd be held elsewhere. So why make the half hearted and blatant lie claiming otherwise?  
And in turn, why are these countries not being held to account, to be truthful about or to be sanctioned, for a move of blatant ill intent, only ever facing ""if you do, you'll be sorry""?","Because it is an exercise in case of military action there. An exercise isn’t just running around the woods, it’s going to involve the huge amounts of logistics involved in preparing for military operations in that area. It’s a lot easier to do warfare if you are already used to how all the trains, ports, and roads work in the area you’re going to be operating in.

614,Should other US states also adopt this? Why or why not?,"The legislature is also unique in that it is the only state legislature with one chamber. Nebraska does not have a house or a senate (though, the members are referred to as senators). It’s commonly referred to as the state unicameral. 

The division still exists. It’s evident that senators such as Blood, Morfeld, Hunt, Wayne, etc. are democrats while senators such as Slama, Linehan, Hilgers, etc. are Republican. See also [Ballotpedia Breakdown](https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_State_Senate_(unicameral))

The Republican faction however also is broken at times between the more moderate wing and the far-right wing. Remember, the vast majority of the unicameral is GOP-affiliated. I will note that this set up does prevent *some* (albeit, not a lot and minimal) partisanship. Recently, for example, Wayne (D-North Omaha) and his neighbor to the east, McKinney (D-North Omaha), were on the side of advocating for school choice (they represent a majority extremely low-income, African American majority constituency) along with many right-wing state politicians.


As an aside, the state court system is also set up in a way to prevent partisanship."
615,"A friend and I got into a hypothetical debate about, what would happen in the case of a high profile assassination, involving a civilian of one country unaffiliated with their countries government operations (Besides committing the assassination seemingly just a regular citizen)   who assassinated a person high up in another countries government, would it instantly start a war?

Context:

Note: These 2 theoretical countries are part of NATO though for curiosity's sake I'm also wondering what would happen if only one country was involved in NATO or neither of them.

Country A: country of a murdered political figure

Country B: country of the murderer

I argued that if it wasn't immediately obvious it was the work of the country (B)'s government, It would probably start an investigation. In which Country (B) would have to agree to cooperate with Country (A), first and that depending on what the investigation determined like if it turns out that person was secretly doing work for the government of Country (B)  or the citizen did what they did due to the government of Country (B) pushing propaganda to their citizens against Country (A) then war would be declared. Or potentially refusal to cooperate or admission to guilt would then lead to war. Or if it's determined they weren't affiliated with the government of Country (B) and they were just a citizen of the country, their home country (Country (B)) would probably have to turn them in for arrest, By Country (A) and refusal to cooperate in bringing them to country (A) would then result in war.

&#x200B;

He argued that it wouldn't matter who it was, as long as they were a citizen of Country(B) and they killed someone high up in Country (A)'s government, due to them being so high up it would instantly become a declaration of war and Country (A) and (B) would deploy their respective forces especially if they had any beef in the past before peace times. Also, he says he highly doubts they would cooperate in an investigation in any fashion regardless of the situation because no country wants another country digging around regardless of what's going on.

&#x200B;

We both lack a lot of knowledge In this area and I'm sure there are things that were overlooked by both of us. I know this may be a dumb question but we're both really curious about what would happen in a potentially volatile situation like this and which one of us is closer to what would actually happen.

What would be done?  Are there specific rules regulations and procedures that are supposed to be followed in such a situation?","It really depends on the context. Are the two countries already so hostile that they just needed something to push it over the edge?  Is the country of the assassinated leader militaristic or colonial, is it looking for a pretext to start an invasion? Then it would probably start a war.

If the two countries are allies or even neutral, then it probably would not."
616,"How has Botswana, a diamond rich country, stay a democracy?  A diamond based economy is a dictator's wet dream, with a source of income that isn't dependent on the wellbeing of the people, so what gives?","The big issue with most theories on how states will act in comparative politics is that they always have exceptions - that's not to discredit them - but people and thus countries are always a little more complex. We use them to help explain phenomena but we can't use them as a rule.

On Botswana, in very short terms, there are two elements to the question - both related and tied to each other but technically different. Botswana has been comparatively stable among other post-colonial independent, resource rich and focused states in the region. It is also a democracy, though a flawed one (flawed not being a negative critique, you could also call it limited - but effectively it is not competitive. The same way Singapore is often called the world's most successful non-democracy - it's a democracy but not a competitive one).

On history, stability, and democracy, good to start with that point. Botswana is stable and yes, is a democracy, but one in which the ruling party has never lost the leadership of the country since independence. The Botswana Democratic Party has always held the Presidency, and has always held it for long successive administrations (10+ years each), each serving as the Vice President to the President preceding them, making only 5 since independence in the 60s.  I'll come back to the impact of that in other ways but that is a very stable way to run things - arguments aside on how it happens - that has meant a relatively unchallenged reign on authority in the country from a unified party with a clear line of designated succession (in that sense,  though yes elected, it's not a competitive democracy with reasonably competitive factions).

Those leaders have each identified, 'trained', and successfully handed over power to their successors after long reigns. In theory, this then is the same theory of stability as monarchies - there's a stability in having longer term leaders who are preparing known candidates to replace them, who will then do the same. In that way, they are almost in themselves, a chosen dynasty. And on the subject of monarchy, the first in that line of succession was President Sertsei Khama, who first led the independence push for Botswana from the British. He was the grandson of King Khama III (and himself kgosi - or king), which ties into again, the stability of transition in power from prior systems (the monarchy, and the monarchy as it existed under Empire) into democracy in independence. (Seretse Khama's son, Ian Khama, the great-grandson of King Khama III was also one of the 5 presidents so far). Unlike many newly independent former-colonies, it wasn't a revolutionary restart of governance as much as it was a transition in line with what they had known. It leveraged pre-existing systems of government into the new.

This was made even easier by the relatively homogenous ethnic composition of Botswana. While most former colonies in Africa were Europeans drawing lines that ignored existing tribes, governments, and communities, Botswana (though not perfect and a history into itself) was largely homogenous ethnic Tswana - so again, unlike many others - they weren't facing as much of an internal divide on ethnic lines. Where one did exist - with white descendants of settlers in Botswana, they handled differently. Despite a relatively minor part of the country (I think sub-5%) they, like most colonial settlers, held an outsized share of the wealth and resources.

On the resource intensive end, they controlled that through again, a 'glide path'. Unlike other efforts to immediate nationalise natural resources or land by force, or worse, allow them to be taken over by independent parties, the government at start moved to buy out the diamond industry control - that sounds minor but it avoided much backlash from those external parties with interest in it and avoided any major disruption in which thrid parties felt like they had a shot at controlling it. The share of control on that industry was always firmly in the hands of a foreign corporation or the government, with no in-between. It also made clear to that white minority that they weren't facing a government that would forcibly seize their assets - and thus, presenting less antagonism between an ethnic minority with resources and the governing body.

Also a bit of a tangent anecdote but important - Seretse Khama quite scandalously for the British, South Africans, and even Seretse's own uncle who was then the regent for Seretse as kgosi, married a white British woman. The South Africans were strongly enforcing (and defending) an apartheid regime and the British (for many reasons) also found scandal in it. And as the wife of the kgosi, Seretse's wife was meant to be the mother and queen of their tribe, which his uncle saw as impossible with a white woman. But she famously embraced their tradition (and lucked out with her arrival coming at the start of a hugely beneficial rainy period), was welcomed by the people and embraced, doubled down by the fact that so many external parties opposed it. But more to the point, it was seen as a union in that even already managed ethnic division with the white minority in Botswana - and did quite a bit to focus even that already ethnically homogenous population to identify collectively under the banner of their country rather than ethnicity - in essence, it was basically a marriage of union (even though one not politically founded to do so).

All that to say, they had a 'glide path' to new governance rather than the vacuum that many other newly-independent former colonies in the region did. And where potential vacuums or areas for revolutionary zeal could arise (power vacuums from unclear succession, competing ethnic divides, opportunity for takeover on resources). One more element was precedence setting on the role of military intervention. Without precedence of civil war or need to take independence by force, the precedence for military control on civilian government didn't exist. And the leaders it had took steps to avoid it developing - partially through that clear line of succession in which military control played no part, and in its leaders delineating the line between them (Ian Khama held rank as general before his administration, and loudly stepped down from that military role before taking up his civilian leadership in government).

All that said and done, stability tends to breed stability. A stable government, especially one with that clear a line of succession with long-terms and of the same party and agenda, means they have the space to invest more in infrastructure, support for the population, and public programmes (especially with stable funding from natural resources clearly under their control), rather than losing money to fighting off tensions and challenges from minor parties (a very different but similar way in which China is able to invest in these huge multi-trillion dollar public infrastructure projects because they can safely plan for 20-30 year projects without fear they'll need to fight for funding or approval). That stability not just politically but on implementation means even less of a vacuum for challenging factions. To paraphrase Legally Blonde, stability leads to better delivery for the public, and better delivery for the public leads to a happier population. And happy people don't just go kill people (or revolt or stage a coup).

That all being said, it's a relatively short history. Stability breeds stability but instability also breeds instability. It has worked up until this point but things can and do fall apart. Unemployment is still high and the HIV/AIDS crisis is no joke. Surrounding instability, especially for an export focused landlocked country, can very quickly spell disaster for such a single-industry focused country. Again very different example but if you look at Venezuela, oil funded government programmes made for a relatively stable (though distinctly not democratic) governance for some time, until it fell apart and all hell broke loose. The country has been remarkably stable but we're looking here at a relatively short history of just over 50 years of independence. They've benefitted from a stable stream of strong and effective leaders who made good choices (for stability) but it also really only  takes one really bad crisis or one bad leader to ruin things.

That being said, the model has takeaways. I think a lot of the effort in Rwanda since the genocide there in the 90s has taken a similar stream of emphasising a national identity to occupy the space of ethnic tensions that existed before, maintaining a very strong (where some would also argue is a limited though 'benevolent' democracy with clear control from one leader) that is emphasising and banking on huge investment in public infrastructure to continue feeding that stability.

tl;dr: Botswana is very stable, only kinda a democracy - and it didn't create its democracy out of thin air, but really just  transitioned its traditional tribal monarchy to meet a democratic system - but it made good decisions to ensure stability and set good precedents for future stability - but has also been quite lucky."
617,So can big party’s like the Democrats/Republicans or the CCP run in other country’s election to try to win a election or are they only allowed to run in there own countries?,"It depends on the laws of each particular country but theoretically yes.

619,"Isn't the idea of an omnibus or sweeping bill self-defeating in the current political climate?

It seems like these bills were really predicated on a ""get things done, compromise to make progress"" approach, where the inertia of a large bill was big enough to carry through a few unpalatable riders and a large platter of pork.

That's really not the reality in Congress at this point. Things have deteriorated to the point that the minority party resorts to pure obstructionism rather than any kind of compromise, with things as simple as budgets turning into exercises in pointless brinkmanship. And regardless of how popular a provision in these larger bills might be, the other side can simply make vague gestures to the rest of the package and drop a few buzzwords to justify their opposition.

Wouldn't a better strategy at this point be a long series of single issue votes on popular issues to either progress an agenda or make the opposition line up and go on record voting down a long list of things their erstwhile constituents wanted without the cover of ""but the rest of it!"" as justification?

I assume this is hopelessly oversimplified...

Edit: Stupid title typo... -_-","Yes, but to do that you first need to get rid of the filibuster (or dramatically change it). It's the #1 reason why these huge omnibus bills are the norm now.

Virtually every bill which addresses an actual issue gets filibustered as a matter of process now, which makes it require 60 votes to pass. Since politics are so polarized and the Senate is so closely split, getting 60 votes on anything means getting at least 20% of the opposing party to vote for your bill, which isn't going to happen. So the only bills that have any chance of getting passed fall into one of two categories: reconciliation bills which can bypass the filibuster, or bills that address such direly important crises that NOT passing something would make the situation a lot worse very very soon.

The first category, Reconciliation Bills, only comes up a limited number of times. Depending on the ruling of the Senate Parliamentarian the majority party can only pass 1-3 Reconciliation Bills per term (2 year period). So they only get *maybe* 3 bills to pass without worrying about the filibuster, so they try to cram as much into those 3 bills as they can becasue they know that if something doesn't make it into a reconciliation bill it isn't going to pass. Even then, they need to get 50 members of their party to vote for the Reconciliation Bill, so when the Senate is evenly divided as it is now it's even difficult to get 50 members of the same party to agree. Biden's Build Back Better bill that's currently stalled in Congress is an example of a Reconciliation bill.

The other category is when an urgent emergency comes up which requires legislation to be passed NOW or the emergency will get worse. Examples of this include federal funding running out (when there's a risk of a government shutdown) and an appropriations bill needs to be passed, or when the Debt Limit needs to be raised, or when there's a natural disaster like a hurricane or pandemic or something and they need to pass relief funding, or if there's a big recession and the economy needs to be bailed out. In situations like these EVERYONE from both parties agree that *something* needs to be passed to address the crisis. The minority party can't score points from their base by being obstructionist, so they HAVE to come together with the majority to pass a bill or they'll suffer electorally. Since both sides know these bills HAVE to pass they both use it as an opportunity to cram in as much unrelated stuff as they can get away with, hoping that the other side wanting to pass relief for the crisis will make them willing to accept something else they don't want.

Get rid of the filibuster and you'll start to see a LOT more small, single issue bills. But until the filibuster goes away big omnibus bill are all we'll get."
620,"Country A wants to join country B, meaning country B laws will override A. but the important part is that country A citizens will be the citizens of nation B, and they immigrate freely and legally to A.","The meaning of the word ""sovereign"" when we refer to countries is that there is no higher authority, they get to make up whatever rules they want for themselves.

I know many, if not all, monarchies have an order-of-succession law of some sort. The counterpart for monarchies, I suppose might be something like:

> So-and-so shall serve as monarch until X happens and then an election to the crown will be immediately held.

(If my question doesn't make sense, I apologize in advance; let me know and I will try to clarify.)

Thanks in advance.","There used to be some systems that were sort of like this. Westminster Parliaments, for example, would maintain the current government as long as it held a popular mandate as demonstrated by passing its top agenda items, and elections would only be triggered if one of those votes failed or if the PM/monarch called for a new election. However, most of those systems now require a vote every so often regardless, such as the UK that now can't go more than 5 years without an election. 

Democracies are just mostly moving away from those kinds of situations as we have realized more and more that regular elections are essential for a healthy democracy."
624,"For context 1920 had 49.2%, 1924 had 48.9% and 1996 had 49.0%. I'll provide the Wikipedia link if you want to dive further. 

 [Voter turnout in United States presidential elections - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections) 

Why do you think these elections in particular had such a low voter turnout?","1920 and 1924 in particular were due to women having just been granted the right to vote, with interest in voting lagging. The article you link touches on this:

>For example, a 1924 study of voter turnout in Chicago found that ""female Chicagoans were far less likely to have visited the polls on Election Day than were men in both the 1920 presidential election (46% vs. 75%) and the 1923 mayoral contest (35% vs. 63%).

If you look at the [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#/media/File:US_Vote_for_President_as_Share_of_Population.png) in that article of turnout as a share of total population, you'll see that 1920 and 1924 both actually had all-time high turnouts by that measure compared to previous elections (with 1912 being a local minimum)."
625,"It seems like after the second World War they were able to install democratic regimes in West Germany and Japan, so how come with Afghanistan etc it just hasn't worked?","This is actually a really great question that has some pretty in depth discussion. You should read Rajiv Chandrasekaran's *Life in the Emerald City* because it looks at this exact question through the lens of Iraq. 

But before we dive into specifics, it's important to note that West Germany and Japan weren't exactly ""by force."" In both of these cases, the government that the US went to war with completely collapsed. When the US was making democracy, it wasn't actually imposing a system on these countries by force, but rather the folks who were opposing the US had already lost and were outside of any formal power structures in society, replaced by folks who were pro-democracy. Democracy cannot be imposed by force--it requires legitimacy from the people being governed in order to maintain stability. No one has successfully imposed democracy by force on anyone.

Additionally, there were very specific policy decisions made in Germany and Japan that enabled the US to be successful. They prioritized getting society running again as quickly as possible. This makes a big difference. To illustrate this, let's revisit Iraq. Chandrasekaran makes the argument that the US won the war but lost the occupation and that the US had a chance to bring democracy for real if had made better policy choices. Specifically, he points out three major mistakes that the US didn't have to make (and in fact did not make in Germany and Japan).

First, the US simply did not plan for the logistical needs of the occupation. Despite being warned that Hussein's regime's collapse would likely cause total anarchy, Bush ordered as few troops as possible into the country and focused them on areas of high priority to US economic and military interest, not to areas of high priority to Iraqi society. The result was the widespread looting that occurred after the US won the war easily stripped away many of the key institutions Iraq needed to recover. Part of this was dealing cultural blows--museums were destroyed, dulling the sense of civic engagement that is essential to any nation seeking to rebuild. But even more essential, hospitals were emptied of any useful equipment or medicine. Schools were just empty classrooms devoid of even desks, let alone books or other learning tools. When the US won in Germany and Japan, the army rushed in and fully occupied the country well in excess of the minimum troop requirement to secure order, ensuring that the brief period of anarchy attached to any regime collapse didn't hamper the country's ability to recover.

Second, the US made the decision to disband the entirety of the Iraqi army. The rationale here was that the army had been Hussein's primary tool of enforcing his repression and Hussein's tools of repression needed to be disbanded. While this sounds good at first blush, the US did not disband the army of either Germany or Japan despite them having this same problem. It was ultimately a very poor policy because Iraq, Germany, and Japan all had devastated economies at the end of their wars, which included jobs being scarce. Disbanding the army only added to the ranks of the unemployed, but now you included military folks in that number. It shouldn't take much to consider the problems attached to that.

Third, the US took a very aggressive stance to de-Ba'ath Iraq. Again, on the one hand it makes sense to purge the political loyalists to Hussein, but what Bush's team did went far beyond that. Anyone who was registered member of the party became unemployed...but because Hussein required any and all public servants to join the party, this meant that your entire civil architecture disappeared overnight. Not only did this add to the unemployment problem, but it also took away the people most experienced in some form of running a functional government. Once again, in Germany and Japan the US considered doing this but ultimately just went after the folks at the very top of the party structure, recognizing that a most schoolteachers just signed that piece of paper because it's what they needed to do to work, not because they were actually active Hussein supporters.

So as you can see, the reason that democracy in Iraq failed wasn't because it was incompatible, it was because the US did a crap job of making the right decisions to allow it to flourish. This is especially a shame because Bush had advisors in the State Department pushing to make the decisions consistent with lessons learned in Germany and Japan, but he chose to run with the Defense Department's plan every time. Had we made different choices, there is a real chance that Iraq would be a democratic ally of the United States today. 

The only other state in the Middle East that's seen enough of a total governmental collapse and US occupation to even have a chance at instilling democracy is Afghanistan. But Afghanistan had some unique challenges.

First, the US didn't REALLY ever completely conquer Afghanistan nor was it ever a total collapse. Sure, the US was able to render the Taliban basically toothless...but at not point did the Taliban ever abandon their claim to be the government of Afghanistan. That means the US literally was trying to instill democracy by force and as we've already discussed, that doesn't work.

Second, Afghanistan is a uniquely fractured country. It is incredibly tribal even to this day and there isn't much of a national identity to unify Afghans under one national identity. That's a very difficult place to start with when trying to establish a democracy. Given that some parts of Afghanistan are basically ""unconquerable"" because of its natural geography, this makes it nearly impossible to get spirit of cooperation necessary in all party to establish a democracy.

A lot of modern history books on the Iraq war will discuss this idea that winning the war in Iraq was the easy part and that the US COULD have won the occupation with different choices. Chandrasekaran's is a good start, but looking at others will get you a lot of the same theme. I'd highly recommend picking up a book on this subject if you really want to deeply explore this question."

631,"  

There is a debate about what brand of environmentalism is better for tackling climate change. It is so far as I know roughly divided between the ""Eco-Modernist"" school and the ""De-growth"" school. The main point of contention between them I've seen is about whether or not it's possible to ""decouple"" economic growth from carbon emissions. 

The thing I've seen these two sides arguing about is historical trends, carbon usage data, etc.… but, especially when it comes to the De-growth side, I haven't seen an actual explanation of the physical limitations that would make it impossible. We may or may not have made significant gains thus far but that neither proves nor disproves it as possible. 

I looked up a chart listing all the sources of emissions and, so far as I can figure, it all seems like it could be decarbonized, at least in theory.

Electricity: this can be covered by renewables and anything that can be electrified (cars, factories, heating) would also be covered.

Industrial smelting: Hydrogen fuel.

Agriculture: hydroponics, genetical modified foods and lives stock, cultured meat

Shipping and air travel: Airships.

Construction: eco-friendly concrete replacement.

Mineral extraction: recycling, asteroid mining.

Those are just some of the ones I thought of off the top of my head. all together they add up to something like 90% of emissions. The leftovers might be able to be taken care of with direct capture. 

Now, some or all of those technologies might not work well or scale properly, but none of them are beyond possibility or even that farfetched. So, what are the actual physical constraints that make De-growth environmentalists think it is not possible? I would love to know if I missed anything or am not considering every angle.

Note: I am aware that many of these ideas are not politically feasible but considering that the De-growth agenda isn't really either I consider it to be a separate discussion.","To put my cards on the table, I'm in favor of whatever policy gets us to 100% renewables in the states the fastest, while respecting the rights we currently have. 

I'm not tied to either idealogy but I believe the argument against de-coupling is that it's based around incrementalism. If you want proof of this, consider the below chart:

[https://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GSR2021\_16t9\_Figure\_2.png](https://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/GSR2021_16t9_Figure_2.png)

I think the argument isn't a technological one. If the problem was one that had a 100 year timerame, then incrementalism would make sense. The analogy I use is that of tarmac at an airport: if you have a football field worth of runway, you have the luxury of ramping up slowly. If you have fifty yards, you have less. Scientists can debate about how much we have, but it's probably less than 20 yards."
632,"I'm from germany and here every citizen gets an invitation to vote prior to different elections. Then, on election day, you go to the designated place, show your [Personalausweis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_identity_card) or passport, you get crossed off a list and you can vote. 

I always believed this to be perfectly normal to identify a voter and verify, that he/she is allowed to vote and only votes one time, I read in US news, that there is a political discussion between the left and right about voting and ids. While I would orient myself left of US Democrats, I don't understand why democrats in the US seem to be against identifying yourself, when you vote? How else can you prevent somebody from voting multiple times? Or how else do you know if the person is a citizen of the country he is voting in?

Or have I misunderstood the whole problem completely? 

Thanks for clearing this issue up for me and maybe explain both viewpoints in US politics!","First. the US does not have a nation ID card.  It's been proposed many times most recently in 2005 with luke warm results and eventual opposition from both sides.  It's being proposed again and we will see.  I wouldn't put money on it.  But generally the Democrat leaning voters have light support for it and the Republicans have light opposition.

Second, we have no unified nation voting process.  Each state makes their own.  This means basic questions like where do you vote?  How long are polls open?  What information do you need to vote?  Do you need to register in advance?  etc are questions with (over) 50 answers.

The problem when talking about voter ID as pushed in Republican states is they often very transparently try to favor their side.  The first problem is the main identification allowed in the US is the driver license.  Many city dwellers do not have a driver's license which favors Republicans.  Additionally, they often add say a gun license, but don't allow a student ID.  This again favors Republicans.  Democrats will often say this disenfranchises minority voters because the law has better protections for not disenfranchising minority races, but has no protections for disenfranchising young adults or the homeless.

I would add that often the voter ID laws used by Republican's often have other non-ID parts that are also designed to make it harder for some people to vote (that just so happens to benefit Republicans).  Changes like requiring advanced registration far in advance, closing polling places in cities so lines are longer, reducing hours of the DMV in the time leading up to an election to make it harder to get a ID, etc."

So yes, Democrats controlled the House of Representatives ""Nearly"" uninterrupted from 1930 to 1994.  But the first of those interruptions was Truman's first Midterm in 1946.  Democrats regained control in 1948 when Truman was re-elected, but then lost 27 seats to Republicans again in 1950.  
  
The next midterm with a Democratic President was 1966 under Lyndon Johnson.  This time Democrats lost 48 seats going from a majority of 295 to 140 down to 247 to 187, but still maintaining control.  
  
And the last midterm with a Democratic President before 1994 was Carter's midterm in 1978, Democrats lost 15 seats in that one.

But as an aside, I think this is actually a really good example of the problem with term limits. Obama was a popular president. And yet he was prohibited from running, so the party that by most accounts was doing a pretty good job was forced to run someone other than their best candidate, but because everyone's standards for the Dems were based around Obama and they weren't ready to move on from him, Clinton suffered from not being Obama syndrome and Trump won.

>The population is turning more diverse, which usually favors the democrats.

It is also a great tool for radicalizing the majority and base of the Republican Party. So in the short term at least, the increase in diversity is radicalizing the Republicans to turn out.

>Trump is/was very unpopular with moderate voters and still has lots of influence, which should be turning moderate voters away from the GOP.

Voters have a short memory, and the fact that Trump is no longer on Twitter and the media no longer reports on him that often has pushed him out of many people's minds, and politicians generally see improving favorability once they leave office. This might shift if/when Trump actually runs again in 2024, but his influence is not being pushed on most people, so they don't see Trump anymore.

>So, why? If so many things go in the favor of Democrats, why don't they see this translated into (bigger) election victories?

Republicans (both politicians and right-wing media) are very effective at messaging, and people generally blame whoever is in charge for the current problems. The botched Afghanistan withdrawal (at least from a public image perspective), lack of immigration reform, inflation, the constant resurgence of the coronavirus alongside defeatist messaging from the White House on the coronavirus, Biden obviously not being as mentally fit as he has been in the past, etc. Presidents and their party generally lose in the midterms, so it isn't surprising to see Democrats expected to lose ground in 2022."
638,"The era of Reagan and Thatcher, leading into Bush and then (GW Bush) was always known as neoconservativism until some time in the 2000s when it was changed to neoliberalism; why did this change take place?","It didn't.  I think you might be misunderstanding what Neoconservativism is as it doesn't refer to an era nor are any of the people mentioned actually neoconservative.  It never changed to neoliberalism which is a different thing altogether and normally refers to economic policies, while neoconservative is based around foreign policy.

Neoconservatives are a specific faction within the Republican Party who originally consist of former Democrats who left the party after Henry Jackson failed to win the Democratic primary in 1976 (thus the name neoconservatives or ""new conservatives).  To keep it relatively simple, neoconservatives believe that the USA is good of force in the world and thus it is the responsibility of the USA to spread American values globally, even by force.  Paul Wolfowitz, Paul Bremer, Richard Perle, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Elliott Abrams are all notable neoconservatives.  They had influence within the Reagan administration had a lot of influence during the first half of the Bush II administration before the Iraq debacle sorta tarnished their image but they are still around and have influence on notable GOP figures.

My guess the confusion stems from the fact that ""neocon"" was a common pejorative for any politician that was viewed as a hawk but in recent years ""neoliberal"" has become more popular as a pejorative online, since Neoconservatives haven't really been in any power since 2006."

641," 

Could someone explain how they can fully get rid of the filibuster in the U.S. Senate?

It is my understanding that the Senate operates by unanimous consent and that any one Senator can gum up the works but they would have to keep speaking. In recent times, the Senate has not really required that the Senator or Senators spend time on the floor speaking. Instead the Senators just notify their intent to filibuster and that triggers a procedural vote that needs to garner 60 votes to move on to the vote of the actual legislation or other matters. The intent to filibuster is all that is done nowadays; no one makes the Senators actually speak on the floor for the filibuster. (There are exceptions to this when a Senator or Senators are holding up the floor with speeches, but that has been done to showboat their opposition to a bill that was certain to be voted upon).

I understand that they can change the rules to lower the voting threshold for overcoming this filibuster, as well as make exceptions for certain pieces of legislation and nominations, and have done so in the past. But the actual filibuster itself, not the intent of it, but the process where Senators decide to keep speaking on the floor and the underlying legislation or matter cannot be voted on until they cede the floor, isn't that built into the Senate? If Senators choose to do, can't they always do a speaking filibuster, no matter what the rule change?

In addition, if the majority proposes a rule change to alter the filibuster, can't the minority just filibuster the consideration of that rule change?

Hope someone can explain this to me!","Its called the ""Nuclear Option"" and its a procedural vote within the Senate that establishes a precedent lowering the threshold for votes without actually voting on Senate rules (which required a two thirds vote to do). This method only requires a simple majority and has been used twice already (once by Democrats and once by Republicans I believe) in the last decade.

This method would still have a fillibuster on the books, but it just wouldn't apply to anything any more."

But it doesn't draw any strong conclusions, because partisan affiliation is obviously not something the CDC would track. The closest they can get(the methodology in the link above) is partisan lean of a region and death/hospitalization/vaccination rates of that region. In that context, the greatest predictor of vaccination status(which is also the greatest predictor of being likely to die of covid) is party affiliation.   


That said, there are only two states that have had more covid deaths than the difference between voters in the 2020 election(and these numbers include deaths all time, not just post election), they are:  


Georgia (Dem+12k) Covid deaths: 30k  
Arizona (Dem+10k) Covid deaths: 25k  


Unknown is how much a death or hospitalization would have a splash effect. In other words, would someone who survived hospitalization vote differently, or would survivors of a covid victim change their vote? Also unknown are the amount of deaths above average because covid floods the health system.   


It's pretty safe to say that covid deaths already cut at the margins of the GOP base, but it would be a minor factor-probably less of an electoral factor than doing a 180 and taking on a strong push to get vaccinated, wear masks and other best practices, which would serve to disillusion their base and open them up to be primaried."

I've noticed an odd tendency of left leaning political rhetoric that I find strange and I was hoping I could get some information of why it is so popular. 

The thing I've noticed is that when people on the left argue against things that businesses, private citizens or politicians do they often say it is a ""distraction"" from what is really important. Like if a business does some nominally progressive things like a have pride day promotion that this is a ""distraction"" from how craven and greedy the business is. Or when there is a center left politician like say Pete Buttigieg, they say his progressive positions are a ""distraction"" from some more sinister agenda. 

What I find odd about this is how it ascribes a sort of calculated, deceptive malice to these people or institutions. It also implies that any small action or token towards some issue is counter productive and only extreme actions will be successful. What I find most puzzling is the implication that the publics anger is a finite resource that cannot be sated until it has reached some appropriate critical mass. 

Why is this such a popular view point?","I find no evidence to support your claim this a “popular” view. I would surmise you are seeing some people use it when commenting on social media.

For instance, let’s say the SCOTUS is about to review a case that could have a big impact on oil drilling in the US. Days before 5 justices receive large “donations” from Shell and Exxon and they all suddenly decide to vote in favor of the big oil companies. Many would easily see this as being corrupt.

Yes I understand that Biden stopped drilling on public lands, but is there any way those wells would be pumping enough oil by now to affect prices? 

Are there things I and the OP missed?   

To my mind prices increased because during the pandemic we had a glut of oil, it became a money losing endeavor to drill for oil, so many wells and refineries closed due to low demand and low pay for doing so.  Demand came roaring back and we didn't have enough oil in the pipeline to satisfy demand, so prices spiked,  Prices are starting to lower again as we are ramping up production.

If this action causes so many problems, but there’s still a goal of some sort of reform, why not just subsidize the working class that comes out to protest specifically?

Just the people using it for private, non direct-profit use (getting to work, getting around).

666,"I feel I don't have enough context to understand what it is exactly, though it sounds like it's unusually specialized or cross-disciplinary knowledge for K-12 similar to teaching epigenetics before genetics or teaching cognitive science.

According to Wikipedia, critical race theory (CRT) is a cross-disciplinary intellectual and social movement that began in the United States in the post–civil rights era, as 1960s landmark civil rights laws were being eroded and schools were being re-segregated.

It's also claimed to be a framework of analysis grounded in critical theory.

It seems to have different definitions.

I'm not sure why people who mostly or completely take left-wing positions on issues feel so strongly about it.

Also, according to the [*Encyclopaedia Britannica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_Britannica), aspects of CRT have been criticized by ""legal scholars and jurists from across the political spectrum."" Criticism of it has focused on its critique of the merit principle and of objective truth.

If people are meaning they believe the occurrence of racism in the US legal and economic systems should be taught, I agree with that. Is that critical race theory, though?","It's not that people on the left want Critical Race Theory taught in grade school.

It's that what is actually being labeled as CRT, isn't. CRT is being used as a blanket term to attack any education about history that focuses on race. And bans on CRT end up having a chilling effect on teachers who are intimidated to maybe just not touch on race at all in fear that their lessons may receive the CRT label from critics.

As an example, usually anti-CRT laws state that schools cannot teach that one race is superior to another or is inherently racist. Which sounds fine, except that the 1619 Project doesn't do that and is universally lumped into the type of concepts critics of CRT want banned."

So knowing Trump counties have a higher death rate, and COVID kills the elderly at a significantly higher rate (and the elderly happen to be have a high proportion of Republicans), we can roughly all agree that COVID is killing Republicans at a higher rate than Democrats now.

Is this enough to shift the balance of an election? Probably not. COVID deaths are still relatively small compared to the overall voting population and even if all the deaths are in one party, would only shift very close elections."
668,"This is something I am at a loss to explain - When compared to other highly developed, highly educated, highly urbanized, and democratic societies, why is Japan so socially conservative, politically and culturally?

In most cases, the more highly developed, more educated, more urbanized, and more democratic a society is, the less socially conservative they are, politically and culturally they are. But Japan is one of the most highly developed, highly educated, and highly urbanized nations in the world, and is probably the most democratic country in East Asia and the Western Pacific, along with Australia and New Zealand, and yet they are still a VERY socially conservative society

Japan is way more socially conservative than any highly developed, educated, urbanized, and democratic ""Western"" society, even those which are less developed, educated, urbanized, and democratic (in some cases much more so).

In Japan -

\- There is a heavy amount of traditional social controls

\- There is a LOT of racial and ethnic bigotry, generally not violent, but if you aren't ""racially Yamato (so to speak)"", good luck getting a plurality, likely a majority, of Japanese people to ever accept you as Japanese, even if you live there for fifty years, speak fluent Japanese, adopt Japanese culture, and are a Japanese citizen, law enforcement and authorities will often detain and punish ""non-Yamato"" people as suspects in a crime and make their determinations in part because of their race/ethnicity and distrust/dislike of ""non-Yamato"" people (and unlike in the United States, British Commonwealth, Western Europe, ect; there are no big protests against this, or really any sort of mainstream debate or action), and many landlords and business owners flat out refuse to rent or serve ""non-Yamato"" people

\- ""The nail that sticks out gets hammered back in"", heavy degree of social conformity

\- ""Feminism"" (as it is understood in the West) is practically non-existent; the overwhelming majority of Japanese women prefer to be housewives

\- The criminal justice system is very tough, and would match what many would otherwise consider ""draconian""; for example, authorities will often detain a person accused of a crime and hold them in detention until they confess to the crime (99% of criminal defendants in Japan plea guilty), the death penalty is enforced for murder and is carried out by hanging (and the process is pretty horrifying; death row inmates are kept in solitary confinement and aren't even told when they are going to be put to death until the morning of their execution), and drug laws are incredibly stiff

\- To further add on to drugs, while many Japanese people are open to their drug laws being loosened, its still nowhere near the level of the Western movement for drug decriminalization, and most Japanese people would find it absurd that so many Western youth think that to smoke marijuana should apparently be a right

\- LGBT Movement is also practically non-existent; while homosexuality is pretty tolerated and most don't have an issue with gay sex between partners, gay marriage is out of the question, to say nothing of transgender rights and issues.

So, how is it that Japan is one of the most highly developed, highly educated, highly urbanized, and democratic societies on the planet, and yet still a very, very socially conservative society?",">- LGBT Movement is also practically non-existent; while homosexuality is pretty tolerated and most don't have an issue with gay sex between partners, gay marriage is out of the question, to say nothing of transgender rights and issues.

This is actually a bit outdated.  LGBT rights have actually become a big issue and recently it was ruled that gay marriage bans are unconstitutional, leading to a flood of expansion LGBT rights in  a lot of local districts.  The current climate is pointing to gay marriage probably becoming legal as numerous politicians and parties have openly supported and there isn't really a strong anti-LGBT movement in Japan for the most part.  

And honestly the main reason why Japan is conservative in some areas compared to similar western countries is probably best explained that Japan isn't a ""western"" country but an Asian country.  The culture and history is extremely different and thus certain issues manifest differently.  If you compare Japan to other Asian countries, they are generally notably one of the more ""liberal"" countries in Asia really only being surpassed by Taiwan.  I'd also argue Japan's ""conservatism"" is overstated on the internet but that is a whole other topic."

Like there’s reason for sanctions alone from that basic fact. Not even newspapers critical of the regime are allowed to operate anymore and the editor of a major newspaper was thrown into jail without due process.

Plus, Daniel Ortega ran for a 4th term as President after changing the constitution in 2014 (previously Presidents were limited to 2 terms). So this would mean Nicaragua has collapsed into a dictatorship - which means you get sanctioned. Them’s the shakes.

Some of the people in the comments here look awful silly defending all this. Read the news more and elevate everything to ideological warfare less. Or at least talk to some actual Nicaraguans unhappy with the situation.

EDIT: Some additional information on the kinds of sanctions levied on Nicaragua:

Now here's a time where it might actually be helpful to read [the list of sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0481) actually placed on Nicaraguan officials.

We have sanctions on 9 individuals:

* Three mayors of small cities
* the Minister of Energy and Mines
* The ambassador to Egypt
* The President of a Nicaraguan government-affiliated think tank
* A managing director of an electric distribution regulator
* A superintendent within the Public Ministry
* The Vice Minister of Finance.

So what's important here is that the sanctions merely withhold these 9 individuals from accessing US bank accounts and buying US property - that's it. The sanctions aren't a trade embargo, which some people seem to have mistaken it for."

Do Executive orders have some limitations on what they can enforce or change in order to prevent presidents from abusing them?","Nothing really; the main thing is that some of them would be so blatantly unconstitutional that it'd be hard to convince the judges to go along with you even if they were sympathetic.  There are limits to plausibility and some things would go so far that most judges wouldn't be willing to go along with it.

So why the lack of action?","Israel could be termed a developed democracy, and has  most definitely muddled in American politics."
679,"No, not the three branches of government; those are the legislature, executive and judiciary, the last of which is usually elected but rarely officially partisan.

I mean the (usual) two legislative chambers and the executive head. At the federal level, these are the Presidency, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. For example, I want to say:

""Already holding two federal [word], Republicans gained a federal trifecta when they won the Presidential election of 2016. In 2018, they lost control of the House and in 2020 the Democrats won the other two [word], giving them the trifecta.""

What goes in place of [word]?","There is no formal term for what you're asking. One of the branches, legislative, is divided between two bodies, but the executive is not itself a body.

You could refer to control and majorities, though. Republicans gained control of the WH, Senate, and House. Or by gaining majorities in Congress they gained control of the federal government. Never heard it called a trifecta, though - not entirely sure that's an accurate conceptual framework."
680,"I get Maine voters are largely independent and vote for both parties but like clearly they like the policies their other senator, Angus kind supports, they seem to like Biden's proposals in the primary since they voted for him hard in 2020, so why would they also elect someone on the same ticket who is about to undermine all of that? She's offered no negotiations or counter proposals or alternative numbers in builld back better. Just she is a firm no","In short, because politics rarely ever operate as simply or consistently nationally as pundits and the public think about them, especially around the blue-red turf idea. While a lot of people are party-line voters, that doesn't matter so much for more people than you'd think. 

Having said that, I'll try to oversimplify and treat the state as one consistent block. 

The core of it: Maine (and New Hampshire and Vermont) have a huge mentality of state identity. And with that, Susan Collins capitalised on three key parts of it 1) being a ""true Maine"" gal 2) being known for being a Mainer and 3) again trying to distance her and Gideon on what that means.

On the first:

I haven't worked super extensively in Maine politics but New Hampshire carries the same, and any state or local election, I can tell you one of the first questions from the public when learning about a candidate is always where they're from. As an illustrative example, I once sat in on an 'endorsement debate' near Derry, NH - basically where the candidates for a local seat field questions from those attending and it's generally understood that's where the local political influencers decide who they'll endorse. One of the most popular candidates got the question, ""Did you grow up here?"". To which he said - ""I have lived in the greater Derry area for the last 40 years of my life, my wife is from Windham and my kids have all grown up in Derry schools. But I was born in Lawrence and moved here when I was 14"". And the audience take away was that he was from Massachusetts (Lawrence, MA is a 15 minute drive away from Derry). 

All that story to say, they take it seriously. People in Maine draw a similar hard line around the idea of who is 'one of us' in terms of being a Mainer or a Maine-iac. Susan Collins is undeniably in that line - she's from Caribou which is the most hardcore of upcountry, beautiful land, and a life of grit and hard-work -- picture lumberjacks in red flannel shirts sipping whisky in a small town pub after a long day and that is Caribou. It's like someone in Texas being a cattle rancher or someone in Florida being a Cuban-American orange grove farmer with a food shack on the beach. You just can't get a more stereotyped background to represent the state. And that's her background to a tee - her family is from Caribou, coming from a multi-generational family business in lumber, with family representing the area in local politics for generations. Sara Gideon, despite a long life in Maine, is 'from away' as they say. She is originally from Rhode Island and Mainers think about that and knew that and Collins pushed it hard. If you're from a state where populations are transient or often from out of state (used to be a time not long ago where it was rare to find someone in Florida who was ""*from* Florida"") that may seem odd but to them it's almost everything. 

On the second:

A lot of it is name recognition and affiliation. 

Susan Collins has been Senator for a long time and apart from some tension around abortion rights and Supreme Court nominees, she has been able to maintain a rather centre of the road reputation that is more popular in Maine statewide politics (with the exception of Lepage). And with that, people in Maine have known her for a long time and have heard her name for a long time and to be frank, haven't been given a ton of reason to complain except for those issues cited above which were quite recent at the time (but we'll get back to that). 

So they all know her, they know her as 'one of theirs' and most hadn't been given extreme reason to be upset with her. Sara Gideon, despite being Speaker in the state legislature, obviously didn't have as high a profile. So the campaign needed to 'introduce her' to the public a lot more - which again in a state that values the idea of 'one of ours' for someone who is technically 'from away' is difficult. Especially since Gideon's role there was a bit masked during most of the campaign by the fact that the state legislature wasn't meeting because of agenda and COVID. 

And on the third:

Collins took all of the above and pushed it hard. Gideon had to introduce herself and Collins took every opportunity to hit the hard points - that Gideon is 'from away', that Gideon isn't a known quantity in what she does (while Collins had a long history in the Senate now and in Maine politics), that Gideon (self-described) was not a middle road moderate but a progressive, that Gideon didn't have the same values as Maine, and that Gideon was 'from away' and reflected the needs of people 'from away' not of Mainers. 

Some of these I've already covered a bit but another part of it is that yes, Gideon was a self-described progressive. Probably not to the extent a lot of people in the country consider particularly progressive but for Maine, who apart from Lepage, has a general tendency towards electing middle road moderates (on either side of the aisle) on most things statewide, it was easier to paint her with the wider attack on Democrats as all leftists. 

That plus Gideon's being 'from away' also was hurt by the fact that she wasn't a known name, and with that needed to fundraise to keep up. Which did mean getting a lot of external help. She got hit for the number of out of state fundraisers she was doing - with attacks that she was flying to New York and San Francisco and South Florida and DC and LA more than she was in Maine (not true but the attack and idea landed). To make that worse, Gideon's team did rely quite heavily on DNC and national Democratic supporting groups - which led to a lot of national focused talking points - when again, Maine cares most about Maine, not feeling like they're getting the messages from DC. And with the idea that they don't like hard line rules on party A or party B, no crossing sides, a lot of the national attack messaging points were trying to associate Collins with Trump -- which again, didn't work because Mainers generally 1) already 'knew' Collins so trying to change her reputation there was an uphill climb 2) Mainers generally like the idea of 'compromise' and working within that middle band of moderates on both sides of the aisle, so a hardline TrumpTrumpTrump was actually a positive than a negative. 

And with that - Collins painted it well as Gideon being aggressive and mean and one-minded and out of touch with how people in Maine are. She sold it as, you know me - your long-term friend and senator Susan. I'm just here trying to talk to you but this out of owner doesn't know how we do things here and is being mean and nasty to me, your friend Susan that you know. She hit on that a lot especially towards the end - that Gideon was being mean spirited, and that's not what Mainers value. You ever see a neighbour or an aunt or someone that you like get in an argument where you know they're wrong? But then the person they're arguing with crosses the line and suddenly you don't care if they're wrong or not, that's *your* person and nobody talks to them like that. That's the argument basically Collins tried to make and it was effective."
681,"
So if congresspeople are the only ones that can make rules to restrict themselves at the federal level, say x person is running for re-election but they hold individual stocks that might lead them to engage on insider trading. Can we pressure our state assembly members or push for a state wide ballot measure that prohibits congresspeople running to represent our state from holding individual stocks as long as they’re in congress? And if so how would it work?","No, that wouldn't work. State level restrictions or requirements on congressional candidates have been tried before but they were struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional. The House of Representatives (and the Senate after the 17th Amendment) represent the people, not the states. Therefore the states have no right to regulate Congressional candidacies or campaigns beyond what's necessary for purely operational concerns (e.g. minimum signature requirements or monetary fees for ballot access to ensure efficiently run elections)."
682,Pretty much title. What is the basis for Biden expanding this policy and extending it to non-Spanish speakers?,"He was forced by court order after lawsuits from Texas and Missouri.

Edit: it's not really an expansion. Any immigrant trying to cross into the US from Mexico is subject to it. I'm fairly certain that was always the case.

Edit2: it does appear to be an expansion, likely due to increase in immigrants from places like Haiti, who speak other languages. He also expanded the exceptions to the application so it's not all bad."
683,I am of course talking about Kentucky. Genuinely curious!,"Actual Kentuckian here.  It's a complicated answer, but one part of it I always flag when I see (usually feral) redditors asking a (usually much less polite) version of this question is that once one party and especially one candidate gains a real foothold in a state, the other party often chooses to spend their money elsewhere.

Kentuckians are relatively blue, for what their electoral history suggests, as Beshear's election shows us.  So why McConnell?

He's a successful politician who managed to win enough times that he could cement his power.  At some point the Democratic party decided that, rather than throw money at him trying to unseat him in increasingly expensive races, they'd put that money to use in other, closer races.  Their party structure atrophied, and now they only run joke candidates against him.

Last election, when Georgia went blue (and when the only way to beat McConnell was to mobilize black voters in our urban areas) instead of a charismatic, left-moderate young black candidate they ran some white centrist lady who had been a fighter pilot, looked like a mean volleyball coach, did a lot of shouting, and had no appeal or coherent vision for the key demographics in play.  And of course they underfunded her.

McConnell's campaign strategy was to literally laugh in her face. And it worked."
684,"Clearly this would be illegal but what measures would the Federal Government actually take? Would they prevent State authorities from enforcing the law? How? Would they arrest the Governor and State Legislature? What would be the charges? Would they arrest police if they were engaged in enforcement?

I suppose a parallel could be drawn to states in the 60s enforcing segregation in defiance of the Federal government. I believe in those cases actual troops were sent. Can we imaging US military being sent to some Blue state to enforce gun rights? What would happen?

BTW I'm not talking about some nightmare scenario in which the State starts raiding citizens' homes and seizing their legally held firearms. This is about gun control laws of the sort that have actually passed but been struck down by SCOTUS.","Good intuition - you guessed the answer already! History tells us that the federal government will try legal, financial, and political pressure first, but yes, ultimately the authority of the federal government is backed by the armed forces.

In 1954, the Supreme Court decided *Brown v. Bd. of Education*, declaring that all state laws that established segregated schools violated the 14th Amendment. (The actual history of *Brown* at the Supreme Court is more complicated...there were lots of follow-up cases, but you don't need to know that now.)

In Little Rock, Arkansas, pro-segregationist groups threatened to hold 'protests' at Central High School to prevent black students (""the Little Rock Nine"") from entering. The Governor of AR, Orval Faubus, deployed the Arkansas National Guard to support the segregationists and block the entrance to the school.

President Eisenhower held a meeting with Faubus warning him not to defy the SCOTUS ruling to no avail. At the request of the Mayor of Little Rock, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to enforce integration. (He also ""federalized"" the Arkansas National Guard - placed it under federal command - though whose orders they would actually have followed without the presence of federal troops is probably an open question.) The nine black students were literally marched into school by the Airborne, and were guarded by a mix of Airborne and AR National Guard troops for the rest of the year."
685,"Trump was very favorable to Russia and anti-NATO.

689,What has Biden specifically done differently w his immigration/border policy that has illegal immigration higher than ever & Texas in enough of a crisis to start building its own wall?,"Biden hasn’t actually done anything differently and has kept Trump’s more draconian border policies in place. The perceived increase in immigration at the border is largely due to things outside his control - increased violence in Honduras, Guatemala, a collapse of government in Haiti, etcetera. There are more people applying for asylum but that’s different than people formally immigrating, so we need to keep the different types of migration separate. 

and the solution of a ‘border wall’ remains as stupid and inefficient as it has always been. Texas is probably doing that only because it’s a way to pander to the Republican base. Nobody with a hint of knowledge about the border knows it would accomplish anything."
690,Isn't in their best interest to keep their voter base alive? Will there be any lasting consequences on election results in the near-future?,"The right-wing political establishment has lost control of the right-wing voter base.

They got the presidency and the Senate and they got their judges and their massive tax cut. But now there's a problem: the crazies have realized that they *like* politics and they *like* power, and they're strategically distributed across the country just perfectly. Social media has allowed them to believe they they're a majority, and they don't want to go back in the racist, sexist, bigot closet.

So now, they've decided that vaccine opposition is the latest culture war to fight and there are enough either true believers or grifters on the Right that they can find someone to vote for who shares their views. Whereas previously the ultra-conservative zealots could be safely ignored (because the country was more evenly split) now the Republicans need every vote.

691,"I guess this might come across as a very stupid question, but im genuinely curious. In a democracy the government is controlled buy the people so why do we have countries like Sweden and Denmark  which have very low corruption and are richer, and then countries like Mexico which have very high corruption and are poorer.

Why arent Mexicans able to elect politicians that arent corrupt and enact policies that will make their countries richer like the people in Sweden and Denmark can?","I'm currently reading a book on this very topic called *Why Nations Fail*. That's probably one of the best places to start looking at this topic in some depth.

But if you want my woefully insufficient answer, a large part of is that the actual democratic institutions of these various places are wildly varying in quality. To look at your examples, Mexico's democracy is barely functioning which trickles down into the quality of their policies. Meanwhile, in Denmark and Sweden we have democracies that have functioned at arguably the highest level for quite a long time, which has directly affected the quality of their policies.

There's obviously a lot more to it, including the question of why Mexico's democracy is so inadequate compared to Sweden's or Denmark's, but if you'd like a deeper look into those things then take a look at the book I recommended."
692,I'm writing a novella about two US presidential candidates and need lots of scenes where they plausibly interact with each other.

693,"Ah, the word that has captured the vocabulary of many a journalist and keyboard warrior in recent times. I hear it used almost everyday now, arguably more so as a means to discredit and silence the ""other side"" rather than used appropriately.... i.e. identifying statements which are irrefutably false or grossly misleading.

So with that in mind, who in a liberal society should be the ones to determine what is and what isn't misinformation? What is actually false and what is simply just up for debate or to be determined? Should a journalist be able to write a story calling the  perspective of a scientist or medical professional in their field of training misinformation? What about disagreements between professionals within a field of study? Are skeptics who question scientific consensus or at least the official stance of a leading organization spouting misinformation or is that just the nature of scientific inquiry? What about contradictory studies? Can one be legitimate and the other misinformation? Should, dare I ask, Reddit mods determine what is and what isn't misinformation?","I think one of the issues is that we, the public, seek quick answers for things that require a nuanced explanation, so a lot ""dumbing down"" occurs to translate from a fuzzy set of weighted possibilities, into a solid conclusion. 

This makes things ripe for misinformation, at the very least because of misunderstanding. Either the author misunderstands the study they're writing about, or the reader misunderstands the implication the author was trying to convey.

On top of that, there is often a motivation for the author to convey some point, or to at least put this ""new information"" into a larger context. We seek to find order, or some narrative, in the world around us, and authors - in their drive to grab our attention - have learned how to do that. But this more often distorts the reality of the new information, especially since the context it exists in is entirely too complicated to convey in words, let alone a short article. 

But all that is to explain why people can disagree on more or less ""honest"" reporting. Misinformation often refers to *unintentional falsities*, usually due to what I described above. *Dis*information only refers to *intentionally false* information meant to mislead.

Disinformation is often easier to call out, because the claims are usually blatantly false, however the fact that politics are so divided prevents people from paying attention to the correction via confirmation bias. And sometimes, disinformation is unclear, or makes claims that can neither be confirmed or denied, which makes them even more believable for those who want them to be true, even without any supporting evidence. The most clear example of this would be Trump's ""Big Lie"" that has repeatedly been debunked in courts, yet still persists.

So who determines what constitutes *dis*information? Anyone who can prove it is false, I guess. That's really all you have to do.

edit: That last thing I said is a bit too simplified. Proving it false is only enough to show that it is *mis*information. In order to claim *dis*information, you have to show that it is not only false, but there is reason to believe that the person who made the false claim did so for an ulterior motive, not just out of ignorance."
694,,"I don't think there is a rise of Catholicism as much as a convergence of Catholics at the same time.  First keep in mind Biden is the second catholic president ever the first being Kennedy, considering that 22% of the US population is Catholic Catholics have been woefully under represented as president.  Regarding the Catholics on the SC of the 114 justices only 13 have been catholic, so again an under represented group, with the vast majority (90+) being protestant.  Of the six Catholics in the SC five are very conservative which is not very reflective of Catholics in general which are pretty evenly split between parties.  What the right wing justices do have in common is their desire to overturn Roe V Ware and that is likely the reason at least 2 of them were appointed.

The Catholic church is no more connected with Fascism or White Nationalism than any other church and I world go as far to say they are less likely to be involved in both of those groups simply because they are not welcome.

In the rest of the Americas, Central and South, USA's intervention over the last 100 odd years has created the mess that it is today. 

This could bring one to the conclusion that the European Countries and the USA are responsible for mos the political and economic problems we face in the world today. You could of course argue that USSR/Russia and China also cause problems through their intervention, but their power does not extend and never did to the levels of the USA and the European Countries.

Is the conclusion correct or is it too simplistic?","Let me put it this way: think about a world history where Europe and the US didn't exist. Would all the problems you're thinking about go away? Of course not. Your thought here is far too simplistic.

Let's look at the Middle East. You talk about the issue of colonialism as the source of all problems there. Well, for one thing, that's not really correct. It wasn't the US or Britain that started the civil war in Syria. It wasn't the US or Britain that put Mubarak in Egypt or made him super corrupt. The US was actually supporting Saddam Hussein in Iraq for quite a while...until he decided to invade Iran unprovoked, and then did it again later in Kuwait. These are just a handful of examples. Anwar Sadat wasn't murdered by the CIA. There's as much internal strife here as there is external.

Plus, if America and Europe just fell below the sea forever, do you think other countries wouldn't fill that void? As you've already suggested, Russia and China have expansionist ideals. A good part of the US and European policies recently have been about opposing Russian encroachment. What happens if those protections go away? Even if we forget about that, why are we only looking at the *recent* colonization? Before Europe's rise, the Middle East was conquered land by the Ottomans. The Ottomans took it from the Byzantines (Romans). The Byzantines took it from the Greeks. The Greeks took it from the Persians, I think, and before that, we had Assyrian and Babylonian empires ruling that land. Before THAT is was the Hebrews conquering that land. 

That area has been war torn and full conflict since human kind developed society because the kinds of urges that led the US and Europe to create conflict there are urges in all of humans.

Russia and Ukraine separately. Are these efforts (or threats) by both countries connected? 

At the least, they seem to be using the opportunity of each others threatened actions to create the possibility of both happening at the same time and leaving the US and other counties with a two front problem.","No, Russia and China don’t have this kind of relationship. 

They cooperate where their interests intertwine. In Afghanistan and Syria, for example. And while their opposition to American hegemony makes them allies of convenience, there’s a fundamental distrust there that goes back to the Cold War. As well, Russia is far more hostile to American interests than China, whose own interests are actually pretty intertwined with America’s. Obviously China is vehemently opposed to American influence within what it views as its sphere, and China steals our trade secrets and embeds spies, but fundamentally, whereas Russia actively tries to destabilize American society, China benefits a lot more from ongoing American stability. We’re still it’s largest export market, and they own a shitload of American Treasuries. 

There’s no real credible threat to Taiwanese border integrity. If anything, Taiwan is in the best position it’s been since the Kuomintang fled mainland China. Biden has made several overtures acknowledging Taiwan’s existence. It’s not a full break from our foreign policy of formal non-recognition, but it’s still significant. China huffs and puffs about Taiwan, but for now at least, it’s all just rhetoric. 

Russia, on the other hand, will invade Ukraine any day. Whereas China has no strategic advantage to be gained by invading Taiwan, Russia very much does in Ukraine, which offers farmland, land routes and most importantly, access to warm water ports. In addition, there’s a very real cultural and demographic divide between East and West Ukraine. Most eastern Ukrainians speak Russian, and consider themselves ethnically Rus, or native Russians. Honestly, its ‘invading’ forces would be welcome by most eastern Ukrainians. Most

 American media misrepresents the ongoing civil war there, and there’s a common misconception that Russia is just fomenting unrest to make a land grab. It would be ridiculous to have ever expected Russia to abide by a pro-western Ukraine gov hostile to its interests. It would be like expecting to live with a Pro-ISIS Canada government. Russia has always viewed the access to warm waters and a land route to Europe that a friendly Ukraine provides as critical to its national security. 

Also, Russia isn’t trying to annex ALL of Ukraine, just the half which goes roughly as west as Donetsk. This half  satisfies those strategic security interests. And Russia has a legitimate claim, here, in that were the people of eastern Ukraine allowed to self-determine their future, they’d overwhelmingly vote to secede from Ukraine and more likely than not agree to Russian annexation.

But, answering your question, China is indifferent to Russia’s claims in Ukraine, as Russia is to Chinas claims to Taiwan. Neither has anything to gain by the other’s territorial aggression, in this case. And whereas Taiwan is symbolically important to China, Ukraine is strategically important to Russia. East Ukraine is important enough to russia that it’s worth pissing off the entire West to them. Taiwan just isn’t THAT important for China. This is just not an area where cooperation makes any sense. That said, China will almost certainly join Russia in voting against any UNSC retaliatory action against Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity bc China doesn’t want to be put in the hypocritical position of having to defend its pretty similar violations of international law norms in Hong Kong and the South Asian Sea."
703,Would he get a huge amount of blame like with Afghanistan? Like that the US is not a trusted ally? Or would it not be the same thing?,"Not nearly as much blame as Afghanistan. First off, Biden is having actual communication with both sides along with our allies, France, Germany, UK, and Italy. 

Russia has been threatened with some fairly detrimental deterrents, such as international trade sanctions if they invade. Also, the US is already bolstering the Ukraine with munitions. 

If Russia goes in the fault is 100% on them at this point. The Biden administration is handling this pretty well from a PR perspective at this point in time."
704,"What other reasons would Russia try to make it look like they're going to invade Ukraine? Is it an elaborate bluff, just a means to an end? Or is the consensus that they really are going to try to invade Ukraine? As far as I know this dance has been going on between Russia and NATO for years now, with not much really coming out of it","No idea whether they are committed to actually invading at some point, but I think at this stage it is part of a hybrid ""testing the west"" strategy that also includes their tacit approval of Belarus actively sending refugees to the Polish border and the various (mis-)information campaigns they have been running and some other stuff. 

To stay with the Ukrainian border issue: Them amassing the troops is in my reading not necessarily just in preparation of an invasion. I don't think they are on a one-way street towards invasion. Rather they are building various pressure points and a trying to see what the reaction from NATO/the EU/the US is. If they meet no opposition, they may go ahead. If the EU f.e. mounts some kind of response that makes it impossible to do a proper invasion, there still might be cracks in the EU foreign policy and their commitment to Ukraine. If NATO massively moves troops into Ukraine to prepare for an attack, well at the very least you can turn around and use that to paint them as warmongers against innocent old Russia."
705,"I'm a newcomer to understanding US domestic politics and particularly Senate/House procedure and the like. In reading about a lot of recent stuff and in particular the following caught my eye from last night: the Senate passed the ""Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act"", and, unsurprisingly, there's a lot on Medicare. There's also a lot procedure-wise on the upcoming debt hike, BUT there seems to be *zilch* on farmers. Why is that?

Can somebody please help me to understand where I've gone wrong? Is this bill referencing something that I'm missing that has to do with farmers, perhaps original text? How common is this?

Much appreciate any help -- thanks.

Bill: https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/610/text","The bill does a few things that benefit farmers and rural communities, albeit without explicitly naming “farmers” in the legislative text. 

First, it postpones pay reductions for physicians who accept Medicare. This is especially important in rural hospitals (e.g. farming communities) where the majority of patients use Medicare to pay for health care services. 

Second, it includes a bill that supports suicide awareness and prevention. In times of economic hardship, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are often increases in farmer suicide. The suicide of health care providers in rural areas is also important to address if the goal is to ensure farmers maintain access to care."
706,"Pretty much the title. Is there any reason why it isn't for every employer? Also, I know it technically isn't a mandate, but it's kind of close, lol.","I believe regular testing is an option too.

709,is there any emotion or threats during the chat? Or is there a video of such a confidential meeting?,"Well apparently these high ranking calls between world leaders actually sound like this:

>	The President: I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it’s something that you should really ask them about. When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do anything. A lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it’s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.

>	President Zelenskyy Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 100% but 1000% and I can tell you the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel and I did meet with her. I also met and talked with Macron and I told them that they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing on the issues with the sanctions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. They are not working as much as they should work for Ukraine. It turns out that even though logically, the European Union should be our biggest partner but technically the United States is a much bigger partner than the European Union and I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more than the European Union especially when we are talking about sanctions against the Russian Federation. I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense. We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes.

>	The President: I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you’re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible. Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He was the mayor of New York City, a great mayor, and I would like him to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great. The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that. The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. It sounds horrible to me.

>	President Zelenskyy: The issue of the investigation of the case is actually the issue of making sure to restore the honesty so we will take care of that and will work on the investigation of the case. On top of that, I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us, it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich. It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%. Her attitude towards me was far from the best as she admired the previous President and she was on his side. She would not accept me as a new President well enough.

>	The President: Well, she’s going to go through some things. I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it. I’m sure you will figure it out. I heard the prosecutor was treated very badly and he was a very fair prosecutor so good luck with everything. Your economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a great country. I have many Ukrainian friends, their incredible people"
710,Title says it all ;)),Define ‘internationalist’ and ‘rightist.’ What are the contradictions you’re thinking through here
711,They were both obviously on the political left. I'm wondering how they were different though.,"Domestically, I think they’d be pretty similar. Attlee’s social programs legacy aligns with what, if he had a magic wand, Sen. Sanders would likely want to achieve. Examples of Attlee’s successes which Sen. Sanders echoes: the establishment of a national health care system (NHS vs Medicare for All), the strengthening of organized labor, and broader social programs like vastly increasing the role of government in creating affordable housing. 

Where they begin to diverge, I’d think, would be on foreign policy. Attlee’s station as a prime minister was obviously much different in terms of time and powers to a modern U.S. Senator. But given Sen. Sander’s positions on modern foreign policy issues, it isn’t difficult to see why they might end up making different decisions had they been contemporaries.

Attlee, for example, supporter and initiated the UK’s nuclear weapons program. It is difficult to imagine Sen. Sander’s doing that. Attlee was also a quasi-imperialist, whereas Sen. Sanders is anything but. (This last point is a bit nuanced; Attlee oversaw the drawdown of British involvement in a number of arenas due to their cost, some of which had disastrous outcomes the world wouldn’t come to understand until decades later. He managed the transition to the modern British Commonwealth from the harder version of imperialism that preceded it. Still, were Sen. Sanders in charge of U.S. foreign policy I think we’d see a very different tact.)"
712,Why are the same people who are pro gun generally pro police when historically the reason they wanted guns is either protection from police overstep or because police couldn’t respond fast enough and therefore were useless to them.,"Those are some pretty big generalizations. I'll share my view. 

What is pro-gun? What makes one pro-gun? 

Most people I know of who are pro-gun see the gun as a tool. Guns don't fire themselves, they need a person to do so. That person's intent may be good or bad, the gun is still just a tool. 

Shooting is a sport. It's not abnormal to like sports, so this seems natural. There is a sizeable portion of people who use a gun and never kill a thing with it.  Target shooting is fun, and challenging. 

Rural living is different. There is a reality that the police can't help rural folks based on distance traveled. If someone is breaking into your home, they will be gone by the time police arrive (This happens in the city too). If you want to protect your rural home, you likely have a gun.  Personally, I don't like to kill. But I'm very glad I had a shotgun when the rattlesnake showed up in my front yard. I'm to chicken to get close enough to the rattlesnake. 

What is pro-police? Does it mean blindly backing police? I don't think so. Does it mean overall believe in a strong police force that enforces the law? I think that is the correct definition. 

As I'm sitting here trying to come up with reasons why one would be pro-police, the answer keeps coming back to why not? 

Are there bad police? Yes. The majority? No. If you were a victim of a crime, would you call them? Unless the answer is no, then you'd be pro-cop too. 

When the police have to deal with people like Michael Brown (hands up don't shoot guy), there is no good outcome, and it leads to people losing faith in the police, which is very unfair to them."
713,"This is confusing to me, the Texas law banning abortions after 6 weeks was allowed to skate by but now they are ruling on a Mississippi law that bans them after 15 weeks.

718,"In 1969, seven unaffiliated anti-war protesters, hippies, demonstrating college students, and one Black Panther were all tried together as ""the Radical Left"". Ultimately, only five were convicted (""crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot"") but in the fifty years since, it seems like the cultural hate that led to that courtroom has only gotten worse, to the point where ""owning the Left"" is an actually legitimate position for American politicians. 

What I desperately want to know is WHY?! Why are ""Leftists"" considered so awful that they are casually accused of pedophilia, cannibalism, sexual depravity, biological warfare, child indoctrination, demonism, or kidnapping?! 

I'm not arguing any of these points, I suspect if any one of these claims were true there would be some manner of evidence. I just want to know where this hate came from, what sustains it, and if possible, how to get past it?","I consider myself left-leaning, but I'll attempt to best articulate the ""hate against Leftists"" from right leaners and moderates. The main problems seems to be the ""woke-ism"" on cultural issues and impracticality of major economic decisions. 

Most of them really don't care about the over-the-top evil stuff that the conspiracy theorists are crowing about. This is a minority view, and none of my Newsmax-watching co-workers really pay attention to that stuff. This isn't to say Q-anon and other conspiracies are not a major problem, but they are still confined to the fringe right (for now).

It's the Critical Race Theory, defund the police, white people are inherently evil, higher taxes, higher gas prices, cancel culture over saying there are only two genders, shutting down the economy, and commie-socialism that annoys them more. Having more of THAT stuff be in the future of country seems to be scaring the center-right moderates. 

However, I think the biggest problem for our country's future is 2020 election results and the fallout from that. I think the number of registered Republican voters who thought the election was ""stolen"" has been rising and is way too high. The number of times I've been asked to explain how much the election results swung at 3am in Wisconsin is enough to get me worried, even after I've explained it multiple times. It happens every couple of months. 

""How do I know that mail-in ballots were legit?""

Questioning the legitimacy of an election is a sore spot for me because I was one of those who entertained the idea that Trump conspired with the Russians in 2016 way more than I should have, which ended up being a nothing-burger. Two failed impeachments, a year plus investigation into Russiagate that uncovered nothing to act on. While I think the Democrats had greater causes for concern, the fact that we rejected the legitimacy of the Trump presidency for pretty much the whole term makes the Left look like hypocrites for decrying the Right's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the Biden presidency. 

Was there 2020 Election fraud? No, there wasn't. There wasn't a Trump-Russia conspiracy either. While Russia DID try their best to interfere in the election, and factored into a Trump victory, there was no evidence to support that Trump had a direct line to Russia to coordinate a campaign. Trump won the Electoral College with the help of voters that believed in him or distrusted the political establishment long before Russia thought to exploit that distrust, and that's what mattered."
719,"I understand the idea of drawing districts so as to favor a particular party, conceptually anyway. It seems like republicans these days are manipulating district boundaries so as to give them a huge advantage. Now I admit I may be wrong here, given that I haven't read into this a whole lot. 

My question is, how is this even legal? Isn't it unconstitutional for a party to draw district boundaries so as to stifle the vote of minorities in said district? And why aren't the democrats fighting back? So far all I've seen is big talk about how republicans are taking away voting rights and democracy is dying, but no action. Leads me to wonder, is gerrymandering legal? Is that why democrat hands are tied, if at all?","Gerrymandering for partisan political advantage is constitutional.  Gerrymandering specifically to stifle minority votes isn't.
One reason the issue is being talked about more now is that the Supreme Court eliminated parts of the Voting Rights Act of the 1960's which required some states to pre-clear their changes with the Federal government (which was based on the long history of those states suppressing votes in the times before that).

Democrats are trying to fight back, but they don't have enough power in the Senate to get things done.  The filibuster applies to voting rights changes, and they do not have enough votes to eliminate the filibuster, nor enough votes to do it in spite of a filibuster."
720,"I understand that these countries were previously Soviet countries, and that they used to belong to Russia. However, why would they want to risk a third world war to attain that?

I personally don't have a strong opinion on the electoral college, but I am okay with it. However, it seems like the people who don't support the electoral college and prefer popular vote don't apply this same reasoning to the Senate, and I don't understand why. Congress is where the laws are actually created and passed first, and so I find it odd that it isn't talked about at all in the electoral college/population/unequal representation debate. 

What's different about the nature of the Senate that excludes it from the conversation?","People complain about the senate being ""land voting instead of people"" all the time.  It just tends to get drowned out by the Presidential elections.  There is also a divide along party lines, since the current situation favors the Republican's/rural States vs the States with more voters who tend to go Democratic.  The flip side, of course, is that the Democrats have an advantage in the House since they're more popular with more people.  The problem is that the Republican party has decided that it can rule without a majority of the population supporting it by using the system against the voting public.  And that's a big threat to democracy."
722,"I say yes, but there's a guy who insists that I'm stupid for believing that's possible. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that most patriots don't love their government because most are corrupt and useless.","That guy might have meant country or nation when he said government.  I hope.  I think that in a democratic society (the only type that's legitimate) the citizens should be highly critical of the parties and people in charge.  Especially when those elected members are the ones that you voted for.  It's like loving a pizza restaurant, but disliking the current management after you got a bad pie.  It's not that you hate pizza now.  It's just that the guys in charge aren't doing things right."
723,"At school we learned about the 3 major political ideologies in our country. As I am not from America, here our definitions are different. I don't know what the third ideology is called in American politics.

Firstly there is socialist. Socialist here means that the socialist wants the government to be involved in solving problems, inequality and in some aspects of a person's daily life. A socialist is typically against a ""free market"", to varying degrees.

Secondly there is liberal, the liberal believes that people are inheritly rational thinking and capable of making the right choices if given the freedom to do so. I believe that it is similar to American libertarians, but I am unsure. A liberal wants the government to have as little intervention as possible. The market should be free but the government should **only** intervere against monopolies or extremely bad working conditions (child labor, unsafe jobs). The liberal believes that what happens in someone's daily life is not up to the government to spectate, and if there is no victim then something shouldn't be considered a crime (with obvious exceptions)

Then thirdly is ""christian democrat"". It is a leaning that historically has consisted mostly of Christian principles, but now has evolved to a wider audience. It is called ""confessionalism"" too sometimes. 
The christian-democrat believes that the majority of social problems should be solved by a local community or a family. The government should only intervere for people who do not have access to a community or family. The christian-democrat ideology works the best in a society with a very high social cohesion. Examples are; your neighbour's house has burned down, so you let them sleep in your house until he has a place again. Your other neighbours provide food to help out a bit. In this example the community took over the role of a government. All actions are strictly voluntary and based on principles that the christians believe in. **It is not theocracy**

But when a person can't be helped by himself or the surrounding, that is when the government helps out a hand. The political ideology is mostly in favor of lower taxes, but it is very different from liberal. I hope I worded it right.

I was thinking of ""conservative"" or ""republican"" but neither of those fit it too well. And it has many left-wing(American) aspects of it, but they only apply to people who don't have the benefit of the community. What is this ideology? where would it be placed on a political spectrum/compass? 

Thank you in advance, I'm rather curious.","It sounds something like ""compassionate conservatism,"" which had its heyday (at least as a brand) in the George W. Bush years. That was before I was paying much attention to politics, but as I understand it the core idea was to use government to promote community support to the disadvantaged. The Bush White House released an [official statement](https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/04/20020430.html) about how it defined the term.

725,"Last year, practically no one knew who Glenn Youngkin was. Then, a year later, he's governor of Virginia. That of course isn't news to any of you in the U.S. and is not what this post is about. This may be a wildly inaccurate observation of mine, but I actually think that in next year's elections, I can see the GOP nominating several unknowns who can distance themselves from Trump as a way to take back the House and Senate and take back all the governorships they lost 3 years ago. If an unknown like Youngkin can do it, anybody could. But I'd like to know what you think about all this. Could the GOP rely on unsung figures to carry themselves to victory?","Probably not. Virginia is sort of an exceptional case - no President’s party has held that governorship after winning the Presidency, with I think one exception. McAuliffe was also a generally clueless candidate who didn’t run very well, and Youngkin had a personal fortune to bankroll his campaign that a lot of people just don’t have. 

We already know who the GOP is putting up in key races in the coming years and the only unknown I can think of, really, is whoever the Republican candidate for PA senate is since Parnell dropped out. In GA, they’re running either Eric Greitens or Herschel Walker, both of whom are well known. In OH, it’s JD Vance or Josh Mandel - also known quantities. 

If the GOP wins back governorships it will be through juicing turnout while disenfranchising Democratic voters as fast as possible. Individual races are too variable to say one way or the other its best to run an unknown."
726,"Isn't the whole point of Biden's climate agenda that we should curb carbon emissions regardless of economic costs?

To that end, shouldn't Biden be cheering for higher gas prices?  Or even trying to actively engineer higher prices by e.g. expanding the strategic petroleum reserve or raising gas taxes?

If Biden really cares about inflation, why didn't he turn the $1 trillion spending bill into a $0.1 trillion spending bill?

This post isn't intended to be pro-Biden or anti-Biden. Rather, I'm just trying to figure out why Biden's acting contradictory to his own stated goals.","Only the Sith speak in absolutes. Of course Biden genuinely wants to reduce carbon emissions. But folks do still use gas and high gas prices create different economic problems. Of course Biden should care about that.

Politics is about balancing competing priorities. Having a good economy where Americans can afford things is desirable. Curbing carbon emissions is desirable. Sometimes these things conflict, and you can't pursue both at the same time, or you can in some ways but not in others.

727,"Since the U.S. would get involved in the invasion wouldn't that mean a NATO country would get involved which would potentially bring NATO into the war? If not, why?","No. NATO's collective defense provision is Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which says:

> The Parties agree that **an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all** and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.

> Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security.

Article 6 elaborates:

> For the purpose of Article 5, an armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack:

> * on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of France, on the territory of Turkey or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer;
> * on the forces, vessels, or aircraft of any of the Parties, when in or over these territories or any other area in Europe in which occupation forces of any of the Parties were stationed on the date when the Treaty entered into force or the Mediterranean Sea or the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of Cancer.

Also, the title of the news article itself, ""[Australia refuses to declassify historical records on how its spies aided the CIA in Chile coup](https://www.sbs.com.au/language/english/australia-refuses-to-declassify-historical-records-on-how-its-spies-aided-the-cia-in-chile-coup)"" itself sounds quite damning. Surely the government realises this? If it does, what's stopping it from destroying the evidence instead of facing news articles like that?",Simple reason is they might need to reference things in those documents. Just because you don't want other people finding out doesn't mean you don't still need to know what's in them.
729,"I would like to have a long, successful career in politics, and I would like to know if being elected to my local school board would be a good place to start. I’m in my 20’s and am passionate about my community and want to improve it any way I can. Is this a good idea? Would this be easier to do than running for city council? Any advice and suggestions are greatly appreciated. I have personal connections with my state Senator and federal Senator through internships, do you think they would be helpful in my endeavors? 

Thanks a lot, I love this subreddit :)","Any elected position can act as a springboard for a higher elected position. It gives that person practical experience in governing (which, like any other skill, needs to be practiced) plenty of opportunities to make connections with other local political figures (elected or appointed), chances to attach their name to various initiatives and projects, as well as increasing name recognition which is crucial for politicians. 

If you look at the [list of current US senators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_senators), I counted four who have ""school board"" in their experience. 

Any practical experience in politics, governing, or activism will help. It'll help you build community ties and figure out local political dynamics. In this sense, the tv show Parks and Rec is actually a great practical guide. The main character, Leslie Knope, starts off as an unelected bureaucrat but uses that position to build relationships, governance skills, and name recognition which helps her obtain higher elected office."

I know I might come off as overly sensitive in saying this, but I think that no one should be teased for their age in the workplace, even if they are young. In fact, I thought the law had to be applied equally to all citizens because of the 14th amendment, but with this idea of protected classes, it appears to me as if politicians can pick and choose who discrimination laws apply to. I thought it was illegal to discriminate against anyone for any reason? 

Why is this ok?","Protected classes are there to remedy both past and ongoing discrimination.  In this sense, they ensure that the Equal Protection Clause really does apply to everyone.

The thing is that - as one example - Comcast, has partly done what this subsection of the act intends. The IEPP (Internet Essentials Partnership Program) - which it seems was easier to implement due to Comcast's now ten year running Internet Essentials Program ([https://www.internetessentials.com/](https://www.internetessentials.com/))  - was/is implemented with school systems (one of them, Atlanta Public Schools, had a donor called Trinity Healthshare) and was/is inteded to get ""a sponsoring organization and Comcast to pay for or sponsor Internet Essentials service for eligible low-income families."" (How it Works Section, Impact Page, Comcast Corporate). The Government, in the Infrastructure Investment, and Jobs Act (H.R. 3684) is Comcast, your state (the eligible entity) is the sponsoring organization, and an unserved area is the eligible low-income family.

So, partially, they have and already had a way to do a telecom money grab or whatever if they wanted.

From How it Works Section, Impact Page, Comcast Corporate

Partnering organizations may use funding from a variety of sources to cover the cost of the service for families. In some cases, this might be through a nonprofit or school district funds, private or corporate donations, CARES Act stimulus funding, or other funding sources. Once an agreement is in place, “promo codes” are generated by Comcast, which the sponsor can then distribute to eligible families and individuals at their discretion. Promo codes are used by Comcast to bill the sponsor directly for the customer’s Internet Essentials Internet service.

But they don't have to be. This is other part of Federalism. With each State and its divisions allowed to use this money for ensuring broadband connections for more people however needed.

733,"The cocaine trade is extremely deadly as industries go. I did a napkin calculation and very approximately 1,000,000 grams of cocaine equals one murder. Most of that is in Colombia (just south of the three countries mentioned), El Salvador & Honduras (just north of the three), Guatemala, Mexico, and the United States, plus a few others. 

Straight in the pipeline are the three central American countries mentioned. Panama and Costa Rica have roughly the same GDP/capita as Mexico, and Nicaragua substantially less than even Honduras and has the lowest murder rate of them all.

All of these countries have very different relationships to the United States, on both sides of the violence divide. There is no shortage of cocaine trafficking in any of these countries, low-or-high violence.

So why the discrepancy?","I wouldn’t say their completely safe but they’re safer. 

  The answer in my opinion is that the countries you mentioned tend to have a more stable government, police force etc. In those countries people have more of a fear that they will be arrested and charged if they commit violence and/ or murder. 

 But let’s look at Honduras for example. It’s much more unstable and dangerous. The police there are corrupt to the point of absurdity. There are areas in Honduran cities where gangs literally have control so the police don’t bother to go in. 

 Let’s say you’re in Honduras, part of some gang and you commit a murder. You probably wouldn’t be scared because unless you’re unlucky you’re probably going to get away with it. The vast majority of cases, last I heard up to 90% are never even investigated by the police. So it’s likely no one will look into it. 


 But let’s say you’re out of luck and the police do attempt to investigate. You’re still probably going to get away with it because you as a gang member probably have the upper hand. Remember how I said lots of police are corrupt? Many are underpaid and accept money from gangs in exchange for information about raids, patrols etc. Your gang likely has cops on their payroll and can tell them to make the investigation go away for you. 

   But let’s say you’re really unlucky and you don’t have that. Still you have the upper hand. The gangs have immense power. They extort people by making them pay a “tax”. They have spies everywhere always watching and people know this. So if the cops interview people in the neighborhood there is a good chance they’ll simply refuse to talk out of fear. They don’t know if someone is watching. They don’t know that the cop isn’t on the gangs payroll. So why are they going to risk their life cooperating in an investigation they know will likely go nowhere anyway? 
 Certain neighborhoods cops don’t go into as well.
 To catch you the cops will have to overcome all of this. And this is assuming they even bother to investigate at all. 

    The difference between countries you mentioned and more violent countries like Honduras is simple. In countries like Honduras the gangs commit violence and murder with impunity because they have no fear whatsoever of being held accountable.

In those countries laws exist only on paper and are something to be laughed at"
734,"I have a question about the Build Back Better plan in the US congress.  To frame my question, here is just a bit of history as I understand it.  Back in the early 1990s, the Information Superhighway was a policy where the US government arranged to give significant amounts of money to telecom and ISP companies, on the promise that those companies would use the money to expand their infrastructure.  The goal of this was to incentivize the expansion of fiber optic connectivity into areas of the country where it was currently not fiscally viable.  However, as soon as the government money started rolling in, the companies in question promptly cancelled most or even all plans to expand their infrastructure as prescribed by the Information Superhighway policy.  If I am not mistaken, those companies continue receiving those Information Superhighway funds to this day, and have received roughly half a trillion dollars up to the present day.

This brings us to my question. How does the Build Back Better plan intend to avoid the kinds of corporate misconduct exemplified by what happened with the Information Superhighway?","The information superhighway was a buzzword that was used to hype up the growth of the Internet in the 1990s.

The HPCA was the Gore bill that promoted funding for Internet technologies primarily by funding government agencies and the advancement of the Internet within those agencies. that included ARPA, and NSF and a bunch of other government agencies that would benefit from installing Internet access. 

https://i.imgur.com/MUjFvsf.jpg

I’m not aware of, nor do I think you’ll be able to find, a program in the 90s that wrote large checks to telecoms in exchange for doing nothing.

But in answer to your question, the way that we will avoid mismanagement of the funds is that we have government auditors, and that Organizations that take funds are required to provide documentation, and that for the most part the programs in build back better are government run programs already. This is just expanding things we already do, like giving people a tax credit for having kids or expanding access to pre-K.

In terms of the climate money, we already have thousands of government programs across the country designed to encourage the growth of renewable energy. they just need more funding. These programs work well and there are strict reporting requirements."
735,"This question is inspired by this news article: [Rebels say Ethiopia capital could fall within weeks as US plans to send envoy](https://news.yahoo.com/ethiopia-capital-could-overrun-months-082257546.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABWPq9D6ydNzaXMMenUh7Hsz-stLClMW_fb2rDY4sdvznzi72JaxbmPpZve1-nimWKuwJ33CKTzEryZILIFUHdlLyCb0OrbjPi72nftqQeMf8r4UIgE5D43zh3WrpZbVXgV-wisAUOj7qBnN_6r-Mbua2gV36NNHHVbObDJW0q9n)

So how are the rebels this strong? Is a foreign nation supporting them?

Also, why do the regular Ethiopian military forces seem to be losing? It kind of reminds me of the Afghan National Army deserting instead of fighting the Taliban, but is that a fair comparison?

We don't get much news from Ethiopia here in Australia. The last in-depth explanation I watched about Ethiopia's situation was the video [Why is ETHIOPIA still Africa’s HOPE (despite the Tigray War)? - VisualPolitik EN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg9oNJCTOlA). That was back in February. According to the video, the Tigrayan rebels are themselves not exactly freedom fighters (i.e. they are a communist state with fraudulent elections).","The TPLF, which is the government and military force of the rebel Tigray province, used to be the ruling party of Ethiopia itself. The previous dictator, Meles Zenawi was the commander of the TPLF when it won the civil war against the Derg government in 1991, and it continued to be his power base throughout his rule until he died in 2012.

So while much has changed in the 30 years since then, it's important to realize that this is not a ragtag bunch of rebels cobbled together in a hurry. It's a long-standing military force that has previously conquered Ethiopia.

And the opposite side of that coin is that the *rest* of Ethiopia's military (sans-TPLF) have a history of losing to the TPLF. They have more people and money, but those do not reliably translate into military superiority. And the current central government has only had 3 years in control where Tigrayans weren't the favorites to build up separate centers of power.

I think comparing the Ethiopian military to the Afghan National Army is probably terribly unfair to Ethiopia, but the ANA set an extremely low standard to exceed.

And do keep in mind that the central government *did* initially conquer Tigray's capital and looked like they had the TPLF on the ropes. The turnaround has been severe, but the TPLF did have to actually fight and win on the battlefield to pull it off.

EDIT: Zenawi died in 2012, I'd written 2018, which is when the current Prime Minister came into office. But there was a 6-year interregnum while Ethiopia's governing political coalition sorted itself out."
736,Just a thought I had while reading up on the Crystal Mason case.,"Nope.  Per the U.S. Constitution  Article I, Section 4, Clause 1:  


>The Times, Places and **Manner** of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof;

Interestingly this gets tied in with the whole slavery debate.  Southern States didn't want the northern ones to have any say over how any one individual state selected their representatives at the national level.

Given that, there is a second half to this clause that reads:

>but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of choosing Senators.

How this ""balance of power"" has played out in the courts is summarized on this web page:

737,"not to imply all macanese don't or do want independence, its just compartively speaking macau is quite silent on the matter despite being in a relatively similar situation as hong kong.","One of the biggest reasons is that Macau depends heavily on gambling and tourism as a central industry--about half of its GDP comes from this. Unsurprisingly, the majority of these tourists are from mainland China. This has created a relationship where there's much more dependence on China in Macau than exists in Hong Kong, which is more economically independent from the mainland. Hong Kong could probably survive without the Chinese; Macau probably can't. (A lot of Macau's population was born on the mainland, too.)

There are also historical dynamics that are probably too complicated to sum up here, but they can be vastly oversimplified by saying that the British probably put more of a cultural/legal/institutional imprint on HK than the Portuguese did on Macau, which made the handover to China more complicated/fraught on the HK side than on the Macau side."

Just how bad was this, and is the comparison to the Capitol Riots a valid one?","I would argue it was significantly worse than the Capitol Riots.

They have multiple tv stations; fox, AoN new max, Sinclair and lots of AM radio shows that their people listen to.

744,It is my understanding that spending bills must originate in the house rather than the senate. The senate passed its version of the infrastructure bill in August and the house voted on that bill in November. I must be missing something but from the reporting I've read this seems to be out of order.,"Yes, that's formally correct, but it's really horribly impractical to observe that too literally, especially in the modern era of parties where the houses just talk to each other anyway. It's be pretty dumb if the House Dems and Senate Dems do all the work together as a unit anyway but the Senate Dems can't do anything in chambers until the House is done.

So what happens is they use a simple workaround. The parties will draft legislation and answer all these questions, then go back to their houses and work on passing it. But in the Senate they just will only talk about the policy (we'll spend 100 mil on this bridge, for example)  while in the House they'll also talk about how they'll fund it (we'll spend 100 mil on this bridge and offset that by a tax on melons). Then, whoever gets it passed first, great! If it's the House, then they just kill off the bill currently being proposed in the Senate and instead start discussing the bill sent over from the House (which is the same damn thing). If the Senate passes it first, the House kills the bill they were talking about, talks about the Senate one instead, and adds all the funding stuff they were already talking about anyway. It passes, gets sent back to the Senate, but since everyone already had discussed the tax stuff when they passed it the first time, then it should easily pass.

Basically, it's only important to be super rigid with that rule if the only time the bills are ever discussed is in formal legislative chambers. But obviously that's not the case. Well before the official bill is drafted, everyone already knows what the bill will look like because it's their job. It's mostly just a procedural technicality. That does not mean it's useless, but it does mean that the actual real life version of how the job is done means that we've developed effective work arounds."
745,"If so, would this make most people centrist?","This is a very complicated question and a lot of early political science works to answer this. The most direct answer to this is the Median Voter Theorem (MVT). MVT assumes that yes, political perspectives are set in a bell curve and therefore the party that can more effectively move to the center has an electoral advantage. At first blush, this theory seems to be pretty reliable considering how often politicians move away from the extremes and toward the center. But it has a few flaws.

Most notably, it's almost impossible to boil down all political thought to a single point on a number line. Imagine a line 0-10. How does this model perform if someone identifies as a, say 6 or 7 but votes exclusively based on an issue where they are an 8? Or what if they are a 4 in one election but then the issues change and they become a 6 or a 3? And when we see parties instead move away from the center, does that imply the model is wrong about predictive behavior or wrong about the way the spectrum looks?

Put another way, consider Donald Stokes' idea of valence issues. He says that there are some issues where there isn't really position difference, just a different evaluation of HOW each party will accomplish the agreed upon goal. In this understanding, there's no party that wants a bad economy. They all want a good one. So this isn't about position on an issue, but rather about how well voters believe a particular party will accomplish that issue. This of course undermines the idea of rational, position-on-a-line based thinking that we see from MVT or a more Anthony Downs kind of rationalism.

Some have suggested that the MVT is broadly speaking hitting on something valuable, even if we need to rethink certain parts of it. For example, maybe there's a ""double-peaked"" curve in the electorate. But that doesn't really explain why sometimes parties go to the middle and sometimes they don't. Basically, no matter how you slice it, voters are somewhat unpredictable and their choices are complex, involving moving and often contradictory parts fitting together in a weird party identification.

There isn't really a set yes or no. The conventional wisdom that the spectrum mostly looks like a bell curve probably isn't wrong most of the time. At the very least, we can probably agree that a bell curve is the healthiest way for your political system to look, and your structures absolutely can influence how that spectrum develops. When it's not looking like that, is it because your structures are bad or because your political system is shifting as it naturally does every so often? Hard to say while it's in progress."
746,What's so significant about social security?,"I did a quick scan of your posting history and have concluded you are American or at least you live in America. Therefore I have to assume you know what Social Security actually is.

So if you earn wages or a salary, you must have noticed something called FICA deducted from your pay. This goes to fund Social Security. The idea is that if you qualify for benefits, you will get benefits paid through others' FICA deductions. Of course many people qualify for Social Security due to disability, however your subject line would seem to pertain primarily to those who qualify due to old age.

So why people are bothered is that they find it obscenely unfair that part of their hard-earned income is taken away from them to benefit others over a certain age, but then when they reach that age themselves there won't be any benefits for them because the Trust Fund will have been drained. Especially as those currently receiving the benefit belong to a generation largely blamed for the fact that the Trust Fund is likely to be drained by then, by having brought about societal conditions that make it hard for people your age to earn a comfortable income and save for retirement."

749,"If the actual provisions are popular, wouldn't it be easier to get the dry bill out and get voted on?","No. There’s so much gridlock in congress that really only a certain bill can be passed because a 60 person vote in the senate is basically impossible. A budget reconciliation bill only needs a simple majority to pass, so the democrats with 50 members plus VP can pass that sort of bill.

763,"I know three friends-of-friends who work at different companies.  Each is about to lose their job due to a vaccine mandate.

Here's what I want to know:

- Summary of current mandates from federal / state governments and large companies.
- I know Biden has proposed requiring large employers to implement vaccine mandates.  Has this proposal gone into effect?  Is this mandate a recommendation, an executive order, a bill approved by Congress, or something else?
- What legal authority does the government have for the above-mentioned Biden mandate?
- How is an employer, airline, etc. allowed to ask for your vaccination status under HIPAA?  Isn't medical information supposed to be private?
- In the abortion debate, pro-choice people are quick to point out bodily autonomy is a right.  Doesn't telling people ""Get a vaccine or you lose your job"" interfere with their bodily autonomy?  Legally, how are vaccine mandates compatible with Roe v Wade?  Politically, a lot of pro-choice politicians are also pro-mandate.  Even if abortion and vaccine mandates are distinct *legally* in the court system, shouldn't they still be connected *ideologically* in the political arena?   Has any individual politician holding both pro-choice and pro-mandate stances explained how these two stances are logically consistent?
- In the US, AFAIK for an employer, it's illegal and discriminatory to say ""You gay?  Can't hire you, HIV risk.  You pregnant?  Can't hire you, maternity leave risk.""  Isn't saying ""You vaxxed?  Can't hire you, COVID risk"" illegal and discriminatory in the same way?
- Why are so many companies moving on this issue?  What makes them magically unafraid of massive lawsuits for wrongful termination for what certainly looks like blatant discrimination?  If the President said ""To prevent the spread of HIV, every company has to fire all their gay employees,"" you'd think a lot of companies would say ""Sorry, can't do that, we'd lose a lot of good people, who would then sue us out of existence.""  Why are companies so compliant when the President says ""To prevent the spread of COVID, every company has to fire all their unvaccinated employees""?  What's different?
- Have there been any court challenges on the above issues?

768,"It seems like US presidents are pretty much untouchable, why is this?","The US presidential system functions differently from a parliamentary system.  


In a parliamentary system the legislative and executive branches are intertwined together. The majority party in the legislature chooses a prime minister who then goes onto form and lead a government. When a no-confidence vote is passed in the legislature it ends the mandate that the current government has to rule and typically triggers a general election. Whatever party that emerges with a majority from the election can then go onto to form a new government.   


In a Presidential system the legislature and executive branches are elected separately. Votes of no-confidence don't exist in the US Presidential system since the legislature isn't involved in the selection of the President. When a President is removed or chooses to leave office an election isn't called to replace them either. In that situation the Vice-President who is next in line would step up and take over the position. Impeachment is thus not an effective way to remove a party immediately from power.   


In the US system the only way to remove a sitting President is through being convicted during the impeachment process. Constitutionally the power of impeachment is reserved for situations involving ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors"" which sets a very high bar for it's use. If impeachment proceedings are started the US Constitution also requires a 2/3rd's vote in the Senate for conviction which makes it even more difficult to use successfully. The conduct of a President essentially has to be egregious and upset even members of their own party for them to be convicted and ultimately removed from office."
769,"Hello.

I hope you are having a great 2021 so far.

Consider a district which elects multiple members to the legislature, instead of the US-typical single-seat variety, with the idea of such multi-seat district seeking to provide a sort of proportional representation.

I know people have shown a tendency in national legislatures towards the cube root of the population and someone even went to the trouble of showing why some power/root-of-population rule makes for an optimal sized legislature -- it has to do with efficiency of service but I digress.

One thing I don't know is whether anyone has done work to show approximately the optimal size of a multi-seat district, by which I mean either ""the number of seats representing that district"" or ""the number of constituents in that district"".

Has anyone come across such an analysis?

Thanks in advance.","Multi member districts are not fully proportional. They’re better than FPTP, but can and do still less to non-proportional outcomes. In the context of the US, I suppose this would probably have to be worked out by looking at the state with the lowest population and using that as a baseline for how many people should be in a multi-member electorate. That’s Wyoming which means a district can’t have a larger population than around 564,000. You could also go smaller and split that up, but by that point you’re expanding the House by a huge number which would not be popular."
770,"Or is there a form of election, other than sortition, which avoids the formation of political parties?","Long story short, yes, political parties are inevitable because they are really helpful to voters.

The problem with politics is that there are like a million different things politicians deal with that are completely unrelated to each other and learning about them in detail takes an enormous amount of time and energy. If you're a normal person who has a job and responsibilities and kids and whatever else, you simply don't have the resources to keep yourself informed on those issues in great amounts of detail. 

Imagine if you had to approach every issue with zero context. You'd have to vet the ideas of every candidate every time. When the guy you like retires, how would you know who's most similar to him without parties? Imagine if you're thinking about president and you have no way of knowing that Obama and Clinton shared most of their policies without reading the details of their platform or listening to a great many of their speeches/interviews/etc until they addressed all the issues you cared about. See the problem? 

It gets worse when you really think about it from a candidate perspective. I live in NYC. Mayor voting starts now, along with a whole bunch of local races. But there are like 10 or so JUST local elected officials I have to learn about. Should I learn every single candidate's platform for every single race? That's just not reasonable, especially considering a lot of that information will be redundant.

Plus, a good part of our democratic functions depend on getting a large group of like minded voters. That's the whole point of a legislature. That means that by definition it makes sense for guys that are mostly aligned to coordinate together to communicate their policies and pool their votes. And that's basically just a very basic description of a political party.

In short, political parties are both super useful to voters and the most natural and obvious vehicle to actually reach your political goals. There's not much else to it. There's no real way to avoid political parties nor should you try because they are objectively provide more good than bad.

The Sunni- Shia thing, moderate Islam v Islamism are going on at once and often intersect. 

 It is absolutely true in the Middle East that the Sunni/ Shia conflict is partly based on religion. The two are denominations of Islam and have different beliefs. I’m not sure about those ask someone more familiar. But basically Sunni extremists say the Shia are not Muslim and vice versa. 

  But if you look closer then you can see this conflict is more about geopolitics. It’s not a conflict of “an hatreds.” It’s true that sectarian wars have happened but the same happened in Europe with Catholic v Protestant. But in many cases more than you’d think the two groups actually managed to live together like Catholics and Protestants did. 

  But 1978 changed this. In Iran prior to 1978 a very cruel secular leader ruled a traditional Shia Muslim Iran. Remember that. This ushered in a theocratic Shia Muslim government. This revolution actually was inspiring to many across the ME to Muslims Sunni or Shia. The Shia thing didn’t really matter. It was more seen as Muslims overthrowing a cruel western backed government. But Iran then began trying to export this revolutionary ideology abroad. 
  This alarmed Saudi Arabia which felt Iran was trying to gain influence over it. They were afraid of being crowded out by Iran. They can’t really give people that as a reason as it’s pretty cold. So they emphasize the Sunni- Shia thing. And Iran did in turn. 


 Think about it like this. Saudi Arabia is merely exploiting the fact that Iran is Shia. They know if they can convince Sunnis across the ME to hate Shias then they’re less likely to side with a country that is majority Shia. Iran plays the game too. They like to portray themselves as protectors of Shiites. It’s really that cynical. In an alternate universe where SA is Shia and Iran is Sunni they’d still likely exploit it. 

 It is logical but morally repugnant as it incites violence. 

  Moderate v radical Islam? Well that’s more of a culture war that the ME is going through. There is a debate over what role Islam should play in society and politics. There’s a fierce debate about separation of church and state or in this case mosque and state?

The idea behind patents is actually to encourage inventors to open up their inventions / trade secrets / other forms of IP and put them into some sort of a publicly-owned escrow, so that they can eventually become public domain / a commodity, instead of dying with the inventor. When you file for a patent, your secret basically already becomes public knowledge. In return, if the patent is granted, it provides the inventor with certain protections - the idea is you shouldn't be at a net loss versus trying to keep the secret to yourself.

My opinion is that the patent system (especially as it extends to cover software, which is on my opinion just fancy math) is, and has been since its inception, doing more harm than good to the general public. Few ""inventions"" that are granted patents are actually genuinely original; rather, corporations tend to weaponize them to stifle competition (for example: [Microsoft's patent on the FAT file system](https://wiki.endsoftwarepatents.org/wiki/Microsoft_FAT_patents), which makes it practically impossible for devices to present themselves as storage to the most common operating systems). More power to those in power, less for those who must play by the rules.

The status quo is China in general [already has very little respect for any forms of intellectual property protection](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2119935/counterfeiting--faked-in-china.html); many of us also have anecdotes to share about a $50 five-star gizmo from Amazon that turned out as a dud - these are often ""night shift"" runs in factories that will produce an entire chip, board, or maybe even the final product, but say don't burn in a serial number, or skip flashing the firmware.

I would expect the immediate impact of a far-reaching patent reform to firstly and mostly hit the western megacorps, followed by their (current or potential) licensees. The effects would be interesting to watch unfold, but (in my hope), ultimately positive to the society. Chinese companies would lose one of their myriad ways to access and copy ideas and designs, but since manufacturing often happens there anyway, and since their reverse-engineering talent pool is both tremendously resourceful and already hard at work - I don't think they're going to notice in the long run.

As for my company? We've always been backend-first, so all of our secret sauce is running on our servers, which makes it significantly more complicated to steal. Perhaps one or two of our solutions are patentable, but I don't really care - one thing we've done was copied (and/or independently discovered) by AWS, another by a different, smaller company. We don't care because our solutions address the needs of the market, and it's never about the idea alone, but about the execution."

781,"On 2021-09-06, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) placed a generic ""Harmful Language Alert"" tag on all pages which feature scans of original historical documents of the United States, directly linking to their ""Statement on Potentially Harmful Content"" page.  This drew some angry feedback from those who took it as an attack on the founding documents themselves (the Declaration of Independence, the Constitition, and the Bill of Rights), since those are the very documents which are prominently featured on NARA's website.

This change can be verified by the [Wayback Machine Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web/).  Is this a sign that, perhaps, the National Archives is already caving in to political pressure from objections to their ""Harmful Language Alert"" tags?

785,"Yesterday the Czech Republic held a parliamentary election that appears to have defeated the scandal-ridden Prime Minister. One of the two alliances vying to replace the PM was the [Pirates and Mayors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_and_Mayors) alliance, lead by the [Czech Pirate Party.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Pirate_Party) The Czech Pirate Party is the most successful of the Pirate Parties, which emerged in opposition to copyright restriction and in favor of an open internet.

The Czech Pirate Party expanded its platform to represent an anti-corruption, pro-European platform with progressive social views and center to center-left economics.

The Pirate Party was seen as having a very realistic shot at the Prime Minster's office. The Pirates and Mayors alliance came in third with 37 seats in line with polls, but of those 37, only 4 went to the Pirates (down from 22), with 33 going to the supposedly junior partner in the alliance.

And as I said, young people here are right wing so they would rather vote for a right-wing party like SPOLU that won the elections or Pirates coalition partner STAN that looked much more centrist. 

And on the other side, from ''left wing'' older people, those people were seen as anarchist and mainly, elitist. Pirate party was doomed to fail and it was pretty clear before the elections but no-one did see that.

788,"Years ago, Rodrigo Duterte in the Phillipines created an anti-drug policy where roaming death squads can shoot drug users on the spot.

If fear of Phillipines-level punishment doesn't make people stop using drugs, it's unlikely that mere USA-level punishment is going to do the job.)",">Has anyone checked whether people in the Phillipines have stopped abusing drugs?

The objective of any drug campaign is to *suppress* use.  There will always be drug use and crime; there is never a complete stop.  Link: [Countries with the harshest drug penalties -- Punishments vary from lashings to life imprisonment or even death](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/countries-harshest-drug-penalties-world-a7425851.html). Nations with strict policies almost never kill thousands of  users, like Duterte, but such action is not unprecedented.  [NY Times 2003 article](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/08/world/a-wave-of-drug-killings-is-linked-to-thai-police.html):

>An extraordinary campaign of government-approved killings is under way in Thailand -- a crackdown on drug dealers that has taken as many as 2,000 lives over the past two months....

Nations with strict drug policies  or that engage in such violence have lower rates of drug use.  An important metric from  the  UN's Office on Drugs and Crime:  [Annual prevalence of drug use](https://dataunodc.un.org/drugs/prevalence_table-2017) -- the total percent of a nation that is using drugs.  You can look nation by nation to see drug use levels. 

>I commented at the time that if it doesn't work, then it suggests the War on Drugs is doomed to fail.

Yes, many drug policy reformers and social scientists assert that drug laws do little to deter use.  Some advocates want all drugs legalized and offer this view, paraphrasing:

>""The War on Drugs has been  a failure.  It hardly deterred any drug use.   Most everyone who wants drugs has been getting them. If all drugs are legalized and sold over the counter like alcohol, use will only rise a bit. Let everyone access drugs, we can rehab any addicts.”

These advocates correctly point out that drug laws do little to deter addicts.  Most supporters of drug enforcement take a different perspective: Dealing with addicts, be it treatment or incarceration, is a sideshow.  Primary objective: Reducing the *total number* of users, which includes many recreational users. (FN) 

From this perspective, a nation with 14% of its population using that reduces that figure to 9% is better off.   It will have far fewer addicts.   And 5% is better than 9%.  According to the World Health Organization, the U.S. has the  [highest rate of drug use in the world.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-leads-the-world-in-illegal-drug-use/) 

Yes, the article writes: ""Despite tough anti-drug laws, a new survey shows the U.S. has the highest level...""  The perspective of drug enforcers is that without some enforcement...if drugs distribution of some sort is allowed, drug use would be far higher.  America has a big appetite for drugs, in part because a lot of people support or promote drug use (below).


= = = 



FN:  Drug policy reformer [Carl Hart recently offered the interesting opinion](https://old.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/ls2l9v/discussion_university_professor_suggests_70_of/) that 70% of all hard drug users *do not* have an addiction problem.  This view runs counter to the anti-drug demonization of drug enforcers--they loosely suggest that 70-90% of all hard drug users develop major problems (FN2)--but reality is that drug enforcers always understood there were tons of people using hard drugs casually.  Hart's figure might be a bit high, but he is a largely right.

This initially might seem to **support** the case for legalizing all drugs, but it is the opposite.  A perception of minimal danger leads far more people to try drugs.  Hart's comments on his drug use:  “I discovered  the predominant effects... are positive...didn’t matter whether the drug was cannabis, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine..."" inspires these sorts of views:

""Carl Hart says meth and heroin are not so addictive.  I'll chance them.""  (This is not to single Hart out as an extremist; more and more drug policy reformers now support people's rights to use hard drugs.)

Drug enforcers see importance in suppressing drug experimentation and casual use.   Some portion of recreational users of hard drugs will always become addicted. Even a 30% *failure rate* for hard drug use (derived from Hart's 70% figure) is seen as a major problem. 

Drug enforcers see non-addicts as much more ""deterrable.""  People with homes and mortgages and years spent in higher education or complex job training generally want to keep their careers going.  They are susceptible to threats of job loss via drug testing or prison for drugs.  *Again, drug policy reformers disagree, persistently challenging the value of deterrence.* [example](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/crime-and-punishment/201804/why-punishment-doesnt-reduce-crime)

2. How does ""pressure"" manifest itself? What does ""pressure"" looks like from the perspective of a senator?

5. Is McConnell only postponing the inevitable? 

Other questions that I should consider?",">What kind of pressure would Manchin and Sinema would face? How does ""pressure"" manifest itself? What does ""pressure"" looks like from the perspective of a senator?

Senators Manchin and Sinema have been under constant pressure for months to abolish (or at least create carve outs for) the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation, infrastructure and social safety net bills, and more. This has come in the form of [op-eds](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/manchin-s-filibuster-defense-contradicts-senate-legacy-he-claims-protect-ncna1263770), [President Biden](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/biden-filibuster-voting-rights-corruption-manchin-sinema-1224269/), [third-party groups](https://news.yahoo.com/left-wing-group-launches-call-170000305.html), and fellow [Democratic senators](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-agenda-sanders-manchin-senate-democrats/2021/10/06/96fdee98-26e3-11ec-a6ad-9ee7deda7f34_story.html). All these examples are for Manchin, but there are ample articles on pressuring Sinema as well.

>Why would the two senators succumb to pressure from other congresspeople if they only answer to the people of their own state?

Senators depend on the support of their constituencies to keep their jobs, true, but they also rely on their colleagues in the Senate to do their jobs. Want to be on a particular committee? Want the chairman of a committee to advance your bill to the floor? Want the Senate Majority Leader to bring your bill up for a vote? Want your colleagues to cosponsor your legislation? Want to be blamed for sinking the Democratic Party's agenda and undermining your party's leadership, including the president? If you have no friends in your workplace, your job becomes a lot harder.

>How exactly is McConnell relieving pressure by allowing short term increase?

McConnell wants to preserve the filibuster, and the pressure on Manchin and Sinema has been immense. McConnell wants to avoid any situation that might change their calculus on the filibuster. If the pressure gets too great and they decide to change position on the filibuster (e.g. creating carveouts or nuking it entirely), McConnell suddenly has zero power, and Democrats can pass whatever legislation they want so long as they can get their caucus to support it.

The debt ceiling is a huge deal, and the Republicans are being hypocritical about it, conducting a dangerous sort of brinkmanship that would utterly destroy the American economy as we know it. McConnell flinched and organized members of his party to temporarily suspend the debt limit in order to avoid what he sees would spell doom for Republican obstruction: Manchin and Sinema changing their position on the filibuster to avoid catastrophic financial default. 

His move was a pressure valve that, at least on this issue, relieved pressure from the two Democratic senators.

>Is McConnell only postponing the inevitable?

The debt limit suspension is temporary. We'll be back in this same spot come December. But for now, McConnell's Republicans and the filibuster live to fight another day."
790,"It seems odd that Eugene McCarthy a man who made his name as an anti-Vietnam war, pro civil rights, pro New deal,  and Pro union, Senator in the 1960s, would endorse Reagan who seems like his idealogical opposite  for president.  Anyone know why he did it?","I think this is a good example of just how unpopular Jimmy Carter was. Carter was seen as a terrible candidate right from the beginning, but the primary process at the time tended to favor ideological favorites rather than electability. Carter won his initial term because he was running against Gerald Ford in the first race after Watergate--literally any Dem could have won that race.

So in a way, 1980 was Carter's first ""real"" political race. And his defeat was so bad that the Dems created the Hunt Commission to reform the primary process and get better candidates than Hubert Humphrey, George McGovern, and Jimmy Carter, all of whom got absolutely CRUSHED in a national race. 

McCarthy, as you point out, should have been someone who voted against Reagan. Instead, he became a supporter. This was an era of poor political process for the Dems as they sought their new identity in the post-Southern conservative core. In many ways, it wasn't until Bill Clinton won a competitive national race without the core of Southern conservatives that the Dems found their current identity."

The Representative walked up to the doors of Congress, then made the Sergeant at Arms carry him into the room as a publicity stunt to show disapproval of the bill on the floor. However, if Republicans were to stage a walk out or try to deny a quorum the Democrats would have the power to compel their attendance. This power to compel attendance is precisely why neither political party tries to deny quorum as a political tool."

The way it's described in the page has led me to conclude, for the time being, that this is the most accessible form of democracy we've got.

Please do clarify any faulty premises, not sure if I'm approaching this with the right mindset and/or goals.","These occur at state and local levels and the rules for them vary by state and locality.

In the state of Ohio, the requirements to get in the ballot are significant. It takes money to get it done. Therefore the vast majority of the ballot issues that even get in the ballot are ones supported by powerful groups. Then to win support in the election to approve the issue, it takes more money.

This means that the ones that win have big financial support from large organizations. This means that the process is terrible in most places and does not achieve the goals set forth.

At local levels (cities) there can be more success as the scope is not as large as a state, but the same problem of money exists during the election. If the issue would affect one group positively or negatively, then if that group has money, they can make a big difference with buying campaign adds for or against it.

Direct democracy sucks. Representative Democracy is the best type of system. The problem with American politics is apathy and ignorance. The problem is that large portions of people are ignorant of the process, misinformed on the issues because they don’t bother to learn about them, or many people just don’t participate."

By any standard, this is a great feat, and it is normal that Chinese citizens are vouching for the party that led them through that development.

Chinese people also know their history, and they have a cyclical conception of it. Two of their biggest fears is foreign influence, like in the Opium wars or Mongolian invasions, and instability, like during the Warring Kingdoms or the XXth Century civil war.

On the Russian side, the 1990s were a traumatic period, and Putin also came with a promise of stabilizing the country’s failing social structures. People in Russia also felt threatened by NATO. You can understand them : they had embraced capitalism at great cost, the USSR had collapsed… only for NATO to expand its alliance against Russia. Plus, they had Yeltsin witnessing all this drunk, making a fool of himself while people were struggling to make a living.

So Putin came in as a strong leader giving a sense of USSRstalgic pride to the people of Russia. They had suffered so much that it felt safer with a leader such as him. It’s hard to blame them for that.

What seems harsh for Westerners is nothing compared to what people had to go through in the 1990s. 

Still, there is more opposition to Putin than there is against the CCP in mainland China, but it hasn’t organized into a significant response for the moment.

799,"The question is about the Israeli government's overall settlement policy over the decades, not specifically the current Bennett government.","This area of Isreali law is intentionally ambiguous so the TLDR answer is a court will have to decide.

Broadly speaking, under Israeli civil law, the state is supposed to treat all of its citizens as equal. However, the Israeli Legal system has some major exceptions that weaken ""non-discrimination"" as a broader principle. These include the Law of Return which only applies to Jews and the Law of Absentee Property which effectively allows Jews to appropriate property left by Arab who fled Palestine in 48'. For this reason, while the idea of ""equality under the law"" is part of Israel's legal system, it is considered far more tenuous than in most ""liberal democracies""

The legal situation in the West Bank settlements is even more complicated. Israel applies Civil Law in the settlements, but it does not claim the settlements to be within Israel, meaning they are in a situation of Israeli civil law both applying and not applying at the same time. The area surrounding the Settlements (with the exception of the Hebron settlements) is governed by Israeli military law, which is sometimes applied in the settlements when there is a security issue.

There is no actual legal mechanism for ""officially"" establishing a settlement. All settlements began in a legal grey area, where it is not clear whether civil or military law applies. No court has ever stopped the IDF from clearing a new settlement, and it doesn't usually have to give a very clear reason.

So precedent suggests the IDF can stop any Israeli it wants from creating a settlement, without supplying a reason. A suit could be filed saying that violates ""equality under the law"" but the IDF would argue it's not bound by ""equality under the law"" if there is a security concern."

Do you program the AI to maximize competitiveness by splitting the state in half from top to bottom? So that in each district there will be dems competing with republicans. Or do you program the AI to keep counties together by splitting the state in half from left to right exactly as the counties are defined? Which will end up giving dems one seat and republicans one seat?


Now complicate that by saying the state is in the shape of an upright triangle and there are three counties with a denser population in the top half and a sparser population in the bottom half.

804,"I’ve heard the qualitative talking points around raising corporate taxes and raising taxes on those who make over $400,000 but is there a source or link for the actual quantitative math? Like X number of people x average Y income x Z % increase in taxes x 10 years = some offset of the $3.5T cost?


Thanks.","There are a number of ""pay-fors"" within the Build Back Better Act/reconciliation package. Some of them involve tweaks to the tax code (e.g., clawing back some of the Trump tax cuts that largely benefitted the wealthy; raising corporate tax rates, etc.). Others involve allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices (allowing the government to put the money to use elsewhere) or adding teeth to various enforcement mechanisms (e.g., allowing the Department of Labor to sue insurance companies for violating the Mental Health and Addiction Parity Act).

That being said, nothing is set in stone yet. The House went through the effort of marking up many of these details, but Senators Manchin and Sinema have long been opposed to the $3.5 trillion number and negotiations are ongoing. President Biden visited House Democrats on Friday to try to get everyone in line and to find consensus on a new, lower number (rumored to be between $1.9 and $2.5 trillion).

A few groups have tried to do the math on the individual tax provisions that came out of the House Ways and Means Committee, but these are more or less an academic exercise until the House and Senate can get on the same page and hammer out a deal."

Each country has their own. Some are quite powerful of course. But whichever country you live in, is there widespread political agreement to act seriously on climate change?

806," I  love studying ancient history but I'm still a beginner. I am very  curious to know why modern Greece is not popular. Why didn't Greece  preserve Olympus temples and strong cultural elements? 

Why are Sparta and Athens not a tourist power?","I think this is probably a much larger question than just tourist power. 

But the shortest answer to it - it is a major tourist destination. In fact, per capita, it's one of the most visited countries per capita in the world, especially once you strip out the outliers of countries with tiny populations (Iceland, Malta, Bahamas, etc). 

Though I think a lot of that tourism likely differs from what you're imagining. People come en masse to head to the beaches of the Greek isles and some of the sugar cube villages on them. I think the core to your question is why aren't people swarming to see all of the ancient temples and agoras - and the short of that is that there isn't much left. And what is left isn't as grand as you might imagine. The Parthenon and the rest of the Acropolis structures are a huge draw - and one of those things that you can't really go to Athens and miss. But unless you're particularly interested in Greek antiquities, it's effectively a quick photo stop or maybe even a longer stop at the museum attached. And while again, if you're a great student of history, some of the other sites may be interesting, it'll be more or less of the same elsewhere. 

As for preservation or just a general sense of the ""more"", as you continue your studies on Greek history, you'll find that there is a huge gap between the powerhouse of ancient Athens and today, in which Athens and much of Greece (taking various turns in time) spent over a millennium in strife - war, occupation, subjugation, in fighting, more war, etc. Even moreso than Italy (in which the whole history of 'Italy' as a united entity is relatively new, Italy at least had rather long-standing competing now-constituent entities  that enjoyed a great deal of stability and power to build on), most of Greek history was pretty brutal - something that the Greeks carry with great resolve in their history books but doesn't often make its way into most average school books abroad, despite how heavily their ancient history is emphasised abroad. Athens itself, for example, was largely abandoned when the Greek Kingdom was established in the 1930s and it was chosen as the new capital city - basically just 4000 or so people living in pretty run down villages at the base of the acropolis. As for why they didn't preserve all of the ancient buildings better, well during times of division and war and occupation, that's not really top of mind for most people - especially when you consider that those buildings weren't always seen as particularly ancient buildings. Sometimes things just happen (fires, earthquakes, etc) and there's not enough capacity or resources or will to rebuild. Sometimes people just move on. We destroy some pretty impressive architectural feats all the time because they either had some tragic incident and it wasn't practical to rebuild or just we moved on. The old Penn Station in New York was absolutely incredible and it was demolished in the 1960s - sure ancient Greek temples and buildings are different to us, but they wouldn't have been all so different to people closer to Athenian heydays, especially if it was already partially in ruins and especially when you're, again, facing war, occupation, subjugation, in-fighting, and more war. 

tl;dr: it is a tourist power, but maybe just a different focused tourism than you might be thinking of because there's not a lot left there to see of that"
807,"I feel like this might be a stupid question, but, if the Senate fails to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling and defaults as Mitch McConnell has promised to do, what options does the government have to attempt to prevent “running out of money?” Can they sell federal land, take on international defense contracts, take on loans from the private sector/other nations in an attempt to temporarily inject cash to avoid defaulting on SS payments and military salaries? Can the executive branch reallocate money from other parts of the government (like the massive military budget) and move it to cover expenses regarding it’s citizens? It seems a lot has been written about the government defaulting and running out of money, but nothing about potential solutions. 

TLDR; If GOP Senators go through with their plan to allow the government to run out of money, is their something the executive branch can do to at least temporarily get money flowing to help the citizens who rely on it until a resolution is met?","One of the radical ideas that seems to be floating around is to literally create more money. Technically the US finances its budget deficit by borrowing money. Normally the Treasury does this by issuing Treasury securities, which are debt. But the Treasury can also issue coins and paper money. It has been specifically proposed that they could issue a new platinum coin - a common figure suggested is 1 trillion - that it could then deposit at the Federal Reserve.

There are other ideas. Perhaps the federal government could find a way to issue debt that doesn't technically count towards the debt limit - as state governments have occasionally done? They can't reallocate funding - Congress already agreed to spend the money through the budgeting process, so that's pretty much set in stone. Much of the money is already spent; in one of the worst case scenarios, the government could use its existing revenue to pay the interest on the debt it owes, and simply cut expenditures by shutting down ""non-essential"" operations and stopping benefits payments. Of course, to most people, the government suddenly not sending out Social Security or Medicare payments is not an acceptable outcome. Perhaps the government could instead default on its debt - straight up tell the holders of Treasury securities that they will not get back the money they have loaned. This has not been done in the modern era, and most people will agree this is not a desirable outcome, although there are people who may advocate for it. Selling assets is not a solution. Social Security cost us almost a trillion dollars last year; selling a number of treasured National Parks would probably not get us to that amount.

New spending WILL happen. It's the only sensible thing to do. The question is, who will actually authorize the spending, through what means, and what will be the political ramifications of that? McConnell thinks that forcing the Democrats to raise it unilaterally - which I think they will probably do - will hurt their party in the midterms in 2022, and while I do not like the man, it may not be wise to bet against his political instincts. Democrats, of course, will have to own it for what it is - a worthwhile endeavor - and sell themselves electorally on the spending that they DO manage to agree on and pass. As a progressive Democrat, the silver lining I see is that it will be ever harder for ""moderate"" Democrats to play the ""fiscal responsibility"" card. Any Democrat at this point who believes or pretends to believe in ""balanced budgets"" or any of the other fiscal myths will find themselves increasingly at odds with reality."

If the Republicans in Ohio have a decent advantage over the Democrats, then why do they still nominate moderates in statewide elections?

809,"The session to count Electors started at 1pm. According to [this transcript](https://www.congress.gov/117/crec/2021/01/06/CREC-2021-01-06.pdf) (PDF) there wasn't a lot else before they started counting and got to Arizona.  
  
There's the [Wikipedia timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2021_United_States_Capitol_attack) that has the objection at 1:12pm, but I'm interested in more detail at around the specific time that Arizona was counted.    
  
In light of the Eastman plan, I guess I'm just curious if Pence counting the Arizona votes by the normal procedure was a trigger for any of the other events of that day. What was the earliest it would have been clear he wasn't following the Eastman plan, and how much detail do we have about the other events around that time?",">What was the earliest it would have been clear he wasn't following the Eastman plan, and how much detail do we have about the other events around that time?

The Office of the Vice President release a letter at 1 PM on January 6th (when the joint session started to count the votes) essentially saying Pence wasn't going to try any funny business. It didn't get much attention (as obviously things progressed rather quickly and people were busy watching the actual process).

https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/pence-letter-on-vp-and-counting-electoral-votes/9d6f117b6b98d66f/full.pdf

The letter makes it fairly obvious Pence wasn't going to follow the Eastman plan, laying the responsibility on Congress to object and reject these votes.

Since there is no real precedent for what Eastman wanted or how Pence would have followed it, here is the Eastman memo:

http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/09/21/privileged.and.confidential.--.jan.3.memo.on.jan.6.scenario.pdf

So IF Pence was going to attempt it, Section III.c seems to indicate Pence could have read the GOP electors from Arizona, which would have been noticed as soon as they got to Arizona, or whenever they tried to certify the Arizona votes. Section III.d indicated Pence will adjourn Congress due to claims of fraud, so that also would have been immediately obvious."
810,"Of course, I would like Germany to elect whoever is best for them. I was just wondering, from a us perspective, which candidate would overall be “best” for the us?","Scholz (SPD).

Of course, leaving fossil fuels also means huge economic pressure on US automakers to get their sh* together (and a faster decline of petro exports to the EU, a huge energy consumer).

Energy politics aside, SPD doesn't have to respond to interparty triangulations against AfD. They may indeed refuse to suffer fools - good for safe harbor for immigrants (Afghans) and good for growing security partnerships against emerging radical right movements."

Gas prices were steady under Clinton, before 2000. Starting in 2000, with Bush's election, gas prices went up from $1.30 to $3.07 by the end of Bush's term. Obama saw a sharp reduction in gas prices quite quickly, then a rise again, then a fall just as he left office, starting at $3.09 and ending at $2.14. Trump actually saw gas prices rise during his term, from $2.05 to $2.64.

818,"I know recognised tribes are considered ""governments"" in a way in the US, but to what extent are they free to do what they want? 

Could a tribe make their chief their executive power, even only as a figurehead, kinda like a constitutional monarchy?","https://ncai.org/policy-issues/tribal-governance

Here's an explanation of the tribal governments. They theoretically have the ability to choose a form of government with a monarch I guess. But really, the function of the local government is to organize police, fire dept, school districts, court system. And the reservations don't handle the foreign affairs things like managing an army, relations and trade with other countries, protecting borders etc. In that system, the government is largely bureaucratic, not ceremonial and there really isn't a need for a major executive like there might be in a full-on country with a monarch. Being in tribal government is like being on the city council. It has some power, but you aren't going to make the position hereditary and hand out special titles and things like that. 

Reservation governments somewhat run like some county governments in the US. They have their own laws and their own courts, just with a little less regulation from the state than a county would. The focus of their self government is like how each state has self government, with their own constitution and control over their political system. So they set their own laws, without being controled from the state government."
819,"Part of the 1934 firearms act required everyone to register their firearms yet someone sued because their state banned firearms and if they registered to the federal registry they would be incriminating themselves on the state level. So they struck down that part of the law.

So why would it be legal for example for a state to charge someone with illegal gambling, fail, then the federal government charge them under the illegal gambling statute and take a second attempt.

The courts seem to be inconsistent in their reasoning considering both rulings are based on the 5th amendment.","The idea that you can be charged with both state and federal crime for the same offense is called dual sovereignty.  It means the states and federal government can't restrict each other's criminal jurisdiction by enacting statutes.  If gambling is illegal in a state, the feds can't prevent that state from using its police power by also criminalizing gambling, thus making the state statute irrelevant.  It's not a question of individual rights as much as federalism.

I'm *not* asking about what deal was broken or how the AUKUS deal looks. Other topics deal with that. I want to know the decision process and the individuals involved. National interests or pointing to the Chinese threat is not specific enough. It doesn't tell me **who**?

Was it a pet project of Scott Morrison (perhaps because he was disappointed with the French effort)? Were there lobbying efforts from submarine contractors and if so who were they and how much influence can we assume they had?","French incompetence/greed combined with US/Australian security interests are a bigger factor than any politician or lobbyist. 

Australia signed the deal with France to replace their aging sub fleet and almost immediately France had a data breach that exposed info about the capabilities of the subs that was never supposed to see the light of day. Since it has been has been signed China has continued to be an aggressor in the South China Sea, particularly around the Spratly Islands. A big consideration for Australia was the fact that the work for the subs would be done primarily on Australia and could eventually be upgraded to nuclear. Since then France has reduced the amount of work done in Australia, increased the cost, and pushed back the timeline for completion into the 2050's - far enough that Australia was forced to rebuild large parts of their aging sub fleet.

Meanwhile, China's aggressive behavior has become a huge concern for the US, Australia, and Britain. Honestly seems like France is throwing a tantrum because the government owned entity building the subs screwed up and they're embarrassed."

This goes as far back as the banishment of aerosol sprays to save the Ozone Hole. Today, cap-and-trades exist, where there is a cap on total emissions amongst companies, and can sell “shares” of emissions amongst each other. We’ve done other things but, at the end of the day, this HAS made a difference. It’s not exactly measurable, but we ARE emitting less in the existence of these policies.

Please note, in terms of the wellbeing of the planet, no, they have not made a difference. We are emitting significantly more GHGs into the atmosphere than can be absorbed by the Earth’s natural carbon cycles.

We need to make policies that hold industries and businesses accountable to the social and environmental costs they make. This means significantly lowering the cap in cap-and-trade policies, shifting fossil fuel subsidies to renewable alternatives, banishing the use of plastics in packaging, ending ocean trawling and soil tilling in agriculture. 

But domestic policy must improve, too. Countries should increase funding for electric public transit as an alternative to the now inconvenient the prospect of owning car that runs on expensive gas (with the aforementioned subsidy shift). They must also section off big parts of land to heal and improve biodiversity. This also means significantly increase funding for recycling plants for glass and metal (as alternatives to plastic packaging) and composting plants for compostable waste (food waste and compostable packaging).

There ARE really good policies that can be implemented. But nothing we have done so far has bestowed any meaningful change. This is what I have dedicated my life towards achieving."

I understand that this serves as a political negotiation tool and that reconciliation bills are a thing, but why let these events happen in the first place when they are so destructive in terms of national security, citizens' well-being and an overall risk to the global financial system?","The debt ceiling was specifically created and designed to be a recurring issue. It was created back when the dollar was on the gold standard. Under a commodity currency fiscal policy makers need to keep an eye on how much federal debt exists because something like a bank run on the federal reserves could happen, which would have crashed the US economy. The idea behind the debt ceiling was that lawmakers were acknowledging they were in unique times which required the government to spend much more than it was used to spending, however they did not want this to become the norm during economic booms. So they put a ceiling in place. The idea was that if there was *no* ceiling the government would take on ever increasing amounts of debt without Congress ever being forced to confront it. The debt ceiling was designed to be able to be raised with legislation specifically so that the government *could* borrow more if needed, but that lawmakers would have to have a debate about what level of debt was acceptable and prudent before raising the ceiling. It was made to be a recurring issue specifically so that lawmakers would debate it on a recurring basis.

However, the economic forces which underpinned this thinking are no longer in play in the US. In 1971 the US abandoned the gold standard permanently. Ever since then the US dollar has been a fiat currency and the US government has been a currency sovereign. Sovereign debt works completely differently for a currency sovereign. The supply of currency available to a currency sovereign is based on the productive capacity of the economy it manages, not the supply of gold stored in a vault somewhere. The idea that too high a debt is bad for a currency sovereign because if that debt comes due someday they won't have the money to pay it just simply doesn't make sense. We control the supply of currency. It makes no sense for us to focus on the level of debt as a number, but rather to look at what the budget is being used to fund/purchase.

Under our current monetary system the debt ceiling absolutely SHOULD be eliminated. At best it's a distraction which forces law makers to waste time and political capital focusing on a number which really doesn't tell you anything about the economy or budget. It's like trying to control how fast your car is going by measuring RPMs. You can be going very fast with low RPMs on a high gear and very slow with high RPMs on a low gear or vice versa. Likewise, you can have a strong, thriving economy with high debt and a weak economy with low debt, or vice versa."

I've found similar stats on signature collection cost for ballot measures, but no equivalent for the recall petition.

I'm having trouble getting what I believe is an accurate picture or explanation about why McConnell blocked the fund, or even whether that portrayal is accurate. Most of the media portrays McConnell as just being an evil old career politician, an the explanations I see on (generally left-leaning) social media essentially explain this by saying he's evil, or that the Republicans block it for no other reason than the Democrats want it. It makes for emotive and entertaining reading but obviously this isn't accurate and doesn't explain what really happened.

So my question is: what is a more accurate and nuanced explanation of what happened with the bill?

Thanks for any help.","I’m a firefighter so my bias is that this fund is an unrequited good but I also have several policy degrees so I can explain why it’s not such a good idea. 

The way that the federal government funds itself is part of the issue. Bills like this that create trust funds make it so that money allocated and appropriated for it can *only* be used for purposes listed in the bill and can’t be used to cover other expenses that may come up in the day to day of governance. Setting a precedent for trust fund based coverage of medical benefits could be seen as not worth the risk. 

This is a bigger problem in state budgets. Alabama is notorious for this. They have some obnoxious chunk of funding tied up in trust funds for various things so that the state can’t invest in new things or adapt to crises as easily. It’s viewed as a long term structural problem in the state budget."

835,I was reading this [article](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2012/06/20/duvergers-law-is-dead/) attacking duverger's law and wondered how valid this criticism is.,"Long story short, this article is not a very good one but it's not a very bad one either. It is making a couple mistakes and painting with an overly broad brush, but if you soften its claims and make it think less absolutely, then it does have some valuable discussion.

The first issue I have with this article is that it slightly mischaracterizes Duverger's Law. Duverger's Law says that majoritarian or plurality voting *in single member districts* tends to create 2 party systems. However, this article does not address the italicized bit. It seeks to prove that FPTP alone does not ensure two party systems. And while that's correct, Duverger's Law is really not making that claim. Duverger's Law is about SMDP (single member district plurality) where the relationship is much stronger.

I also think the metric used in the graphs is a bit flawed. Looking at the US, it favors the US because everything neatly falls into the two colored bits, indicating that quite often an absolute majority is reached in any given race, and it's a clear two party system because both sides have lots of dots, right? The problem here is that this can indicate polarized one party rule as much as it does genuine two party rule. The US has a lot of races, and many of them are non-competitive, and while that's not necessarily as bad as it sounds, the result is that in a lot of races, there really aren't even two viable parties. This doesn't support Duverger's Law because Duverger's Law indicates that SMDP creates two parties because all that matters is getting 50%+1 and so building alliances that can get your whole ""side"" unified under one banner is the optimal play. There's some similarity to the Median Voter Theorem in that regard.

But the US right now isn't actually seeing both parties show that kind of behavior. Take a look at the recall election that happened just yesterday--instead of finding a candidate that can unite all the right of center folks, the Reps ran a far right candidate that had no chance of getting majority support. Duverger's Law implies that the Reps would chase a majority and that's why there is no space for third parties. Instead they punted and ran a minority candidate they hoped to win by a fluky plurality.

Then the article shifts to the UK, and makes the case that the dots are less cleanly in the colored areas, so less 2-party voting. But I'm not sure this is fair. For one thing, let's talk about the Liberal Democrats. It's tempting to look at them and say ""they're a third party and they have 12 seats so clearly the UK isn't a two party system!"" I think this is a mistake because it ignores the context of the Lib Dems entirely. There was a time the Lib Dems were the main left-leaning party in the UK, until Labour (which was at the time an actual socialist party) broken in, started taking their seats, and eventually became the main left-leaning party in their stead. For a little while, there was a bit of a coalition between them, with Labour clearly the main guys but the Lib Dems still having maybe half their seats and forming a true, two-party left. However, in recent years this has dwindled down to almost nothing. The Lib Dems having only 12 seats is one of their lowest points in history. In short, this isn't a party that has anchored itself as a different flavour of leftness in the political spectrum--it's a party whose flavour of leftness has been declining over the decades to its current point of near irrelevance. This is a dying party. The Lib Dems are a third party, but for how much longer will they be any more influential than the US's Greens or Libertarians?

Further, even in cases where the whole picture isn't summed up just in Tory-Labour, like in areas with the Scottish or Welsh nationalist parties, we aren't really seeing so much of a multiparty race as we are seeing a different two party structure. For example, in all of England, 90% of the districts are two horse races between Con and Lab. Once we get into Scotland we see mostly two horse races with SNP and either Con or Lab. It's exceedingly rare to see a real multiparty race. We see it somewhat in Northern Ireland/Wales, but that's a bit of an outlier situation. I think folks forget how much the UK is really 4 countries put together in one United Kingdom. So to say that the UK is multiparty system because four different countries have two main parties and a third of varying strength, therefore Duverger's Law is false, is a bit beyond the pale.

So yes, while there are SOME weaknesses with Duverger's Law in the UK, it's certainly more true than it is false. And when you compare the UK to other parliamentary structures, the UK is one of the systems with the lowest number of parties. Compare the UK to Germany or France. Those are true multiparty systems and Germany at least uses multimember districts but is in other ways fairly similar to the UK's structure. Duverger's Law would predict that the more you do SMDP-type structures, the fewer parties. Most of Europe proves that out.

I don't really know enough about India's system to comment, but I would like to revisit a point about the US that this article does not address at all. And that's the fact that the US does have real, actual third parties, but first of all not the ones that the article talks about, and second of all, they exist in a way which confirms Duverger's Law.

First, the Libertarians and to a lesser extent the Greens are not actual political parties. They do not try to win elections. The Libertarians last year ran Jo Jorgensen for president, a candidate who failed to win a local race and made a whole political platform that commented on every issue with a plan she would enact if elected. But this is stupid. She had no allies in Congress. Even a voter did agree with her that all sex work should be legalized on day one, how would she do that with zero Libertarians in Congress? She made a promise she knew she couldn't fulfill in our system, and not just because it was hard to do, but because it was functionally impossible.

Actual political parties don't do this. They organize grassroots support. They have local voter groups that can vet candidates for local, statewide, or lower federal office. They create volunteer networks and reach out across the political system to activists, organizations and so on that can broaden their support. They try and actually run candidates that can win. We do have that in the US, but not from the Libertarians.

By any definition, the Tea Party was a third party. Same with the Progressives and the Trump Republicans. These are folks who had a set of actionable principles organized into a platform with a plan to get there. They ran candidates in a variety of races to gain political influence. They challenged the dominant party on their own ""side"" and actually gained voters from them. This is what a true third party looks like.

But at the end of the day, all three of these parties have chosen to crash into the dominant party and rearrange their priorities, fusing together into a new take on the left or right. This is where Duverger's Law comes in. The reality is that a third party that actually has real potential (not the Libs) does need to join into the two party system to maintain its competitive position. Trump did this almost immediately, the Squad has gradually settled down to become far-left establishment folks but no longer actively opposed to the Dems, and the Tea Party became so ingrained into the party that they successfully made themselves the norm when they ousted Boehner and replaced him with Ryan. This is the strongest evidence for Duverger's Law. The US is actually living in a bit of a golden age for third parties, oddly enough. Duverger's Law is why that is true and we still only have Dems and Reps.

So overall the article does raise some good points in that there is no slavish, ultra-hard relationship between SMDP and two parties. However, I would posit that understanding a Law like that is somewhat inappropriate even in hard sciences and is definitely inappropriate in social sciences. Duverger's Law IS correct in that SMDP does pull a system more towards two party structures than anything else, and unless you have other systems in place to weaken that pull (like a Westminster Parliament in the UK), you're very likely to end up with a strong two party system as the US shows. But even in the US, this is as much about other things that reinforce Duverger's Law (federalism and checks and balances really help the two party system a LOT) as it is SMDP is some irrevocable benchmark.

Overall, the article does begin a good discussion in certain areas. But as someone who has a degree in political science and has studied this, it's a bit like an American who is fluent in Spanish living in Spain. They can speak Spanish way, way better than most Americans. But their accent is just a bit off, and you can just tell this is their second language. They're not exactly wrong, per se, but no one would make them out to be a natural-born Spanish speaker.  This article is like that. It is not talking about some things it should, and it's harping on some things it shouldn't, and overall it's kinda going in the right direction but missing some key context."
836,"I feel like the world is built on the idea of property rights, those primarily being land and water rights, and those rights seem to assume that geography doesn't change. 

But how does our global system handle it when the water, that millions of people drink from, changes its course and flows in a vastly different direction? 

It's easy to ignore geological time scales because our lives are so short by comparison. But a fertile field for one generation can very easily become unusable in later generations. 

Ideally we'll find ways for people to eat and drink but it doesn't seem like we're putting a lot of thought into that now.

This is the video that has me thinking about these things. 
 https://youtu.be/dVpEEBcE8tc","Mass migration in the sense you're thinking is almost exclusively due to political, not environmental concerns.

Not only does the environment change very slowly (in comparison to human life spans), but lacking resources in one area isn't actually a problem because we can transport resources.

Consider New York City. Nothing grows there, but people manage to eat. It doesn't have freshwater reserves even a fraction of what is necessary to sustain its population, yet they manage to drink. It can't produce enough power to keep the lights on, but the lights remain on. If people aren't fleeing New York City en masse, why would they flee places that can actually support themselves now because it's slightly harder to do so in the future?"
837,"So I am from America. A lot of people on the more progressive side of politics use the Scandinavian nations as an example as to why Democratic Socialism is a superior model to what we use in America. They usually bring up the high taxes on top income earners, a very strong social safety net, and various government programs such as national healthcare to back up this claim.

The reason I ask is when I look at it, it doesn't seem socialist to me, it just seems like a more regulated form of capitalism. Am I wrong?","So our economic model is actually a capitalistic outset, with varying formats of taxation, (dependant on which country, and their focusses) which helps to create a stronger outset for a better social democratic public policy.

Our public policy Are how ever more focused towards social democracy, which entails a focus on a broad spectrum of public services like free education, free health care, good social services, humane prison etc. (all of this of course not being free, but paid for though taxes)
This helps us have a largely egalitarian society, with most of the basic nescesseties being ensured, so that we can focus on getting a good carrier, a life worth living, all in reletive comfort from the get go.

Of course there are differing oppinions on taxation within our countries, however a large percent age of us are fine with the rellatively high taxes we pay, because we collectively benefit one way or another.

838,I’m confused as I’ve heard he is raising taxes for the poor and he is not raising taxes for the poor.,"The first and most important thing to understand is that there is no policy or bill yet. There is a loose outline of priorities which have general broad agreement from the key Democrats who will be needed to pass it, but they haven't finished writing the actual bill yet. Any discussion about what is or is not in the policy is entirely based on priorities Biden has said he *wants* in the bill, but nothing is guaranteed until the bill is written and passed. 

It's also important to note that while there is broad agreement among Democrats as to the priorities of the policy, there is a LOT of disagreement on the specifics. For example, Senator Bernie Sanders, chair of the Senate Budget Committee which is writing the bill, has presented a goal for a $3.5 trillion bill and he's said that anything less would be a non-starter for him. Meanwhile, conservative Democrat Joe Manchin has said that anything higher than $1.5 trillion is a non-starter for him. The plan put forth by the Biden administration is more in line with Sanders' preferred $3.5 trillion. So either Manchin will have to accept the higher price tag or Biden and Sanders will have to cut some of their priorities from the bill.

The tax increases included in the policy outline are:

* An increase in the top marginal corporate tax rate to 26.5%. This only applies to corporate income over $5 million. Everything up to $400k is taxed at 18% (unchanged) and everything from $400k to $5 mil is 21% (unchanged). In 2017 the GOP cut this top rate from 26.5% to 21%, so this is just reverting it to the pre-2017 rate.

* An increase in the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6%. In 2017 the GOP cut this rate from 39.6% to 37%, so this is just reverting it to the pre-2017 rate.

* A 3% 1-time surcharge on individual income above $5 million

* A 25% capital gains tax

* No tax increase on anyone who makes $400,000 or less

* An increase to the federal tobacco tax (applied to the retail sale of tobacco products)

* A reduction in various tax deductions for high-income individuals and corporations

* An increase in the IRS's budget by $79 billion to help enforce already existing taxes on high income individuals and corporations which are currently going unpaid.

The policy outline as it exists now very specifically does NOT increase taxes on anyone making less than $400k annually (except, maybe, the increased tobacco tax if you purchase tobacco products). We'll have to see what the actual bill looks like when it's done being written to know if that changes."

840,"Upon driving home today and seeing the roadwork being done, I got to thinking about government spending a what kind of, if any, procurement process goes into that spending.","Yes - states, counties, and the Federal Government all have procurement offices and rules and processes for becoming suppliers.

The TLDR of the book is: Men are more justice, rule bound, binary and hierarchal hence why they tend to vote conservative unless there is a reason not to (like race-- black men are quite conservative but can't vote that way for obvious reasons). 

Women are more about loyalty to the community and that manifests itself either positively like education for children, equality for the marginalized, or negatively like abortion and hyperreligiosity.

842,"Considering the massive inequality over the centuries and the gross human rights violations toward People of Color and women and the poor, there should have been large support for leftist organizations with growth toward expanding that today.","It might help to think of these issues in the way conservatives do:  
- The left doesn't want to fix inequality. They just want to be on top.  
- The left doesn't want to help People of Color. They just want to exploit them by emphasizing their victimhood.  
- The left doesn't want to fix poverty. They just want to make it easier for people to suffer in poverty.  
- The left doesn't want to make women happier. They want women to be forced into behavior that favors a few at the expense of the many.

You might also consider that what the left views as major problems simply aren't for many conservatives. Liberals tend to be in situations where you have inequality and little autonomy - they have far less confidence in their own personal ability to deal with their problems. In contrast, conservatives tend to be in situations where there is broad egalitarianism and a great deal of autonomy, so they have far less need/desire for government to protect them at the expense of other people making decisions for them.

Ultimately, I think you may be making the mistake of presuming that everyone shares not just your judgment about what are the critical problems facing our society but how those problems should be addressed."

He thinks polygamy should be legal and supports gay rights and he doesn't think a license should be required to buy a gun and he says he sees a good side and a bad side to both capitalism and socialism.,"This seems straight libertarian. Their interest in Sanders is from their populist sentiments, not some of Sanders’ more leftist views."
844,"If policy can't get through the senate because there aren't enough senators willing to vote for it, why would paying lobbyists to say please do anything? Is it just to look like you're doing something?","Sometimes there is enough ""soft"" support or opposition for a bill that a lobbying blitz can be effective in firming up those votes and passing or killing legislation. Other times legislation might be existential to a special interest group or industry, and so regardless of the likelihood of success they have no choice but to go all out rather than watch a bill pass (or fail) that would change their industry as they know it (for the perceived worse). 

Lobbying blitzes often include tactics beyond formal lobbying. They generally manifest as a combination of lobbying and public affairs influence campaigns. So, yes, you may have a higher volume of shoe leather lobbying speaking with a greater number of Senators -- but you would probably also see local electeds, personal friends, or other high-profile or powerful influencers and key opinion leaders get engaged. There could be radio, TV, and digital ad campaigns. There could be grassroots letter-writing and patch through call campaigns (these last two are when a company or group contacts voters, educates them on an issue, and patches them through to the congressional switchboard to advocate directly with their members).

At the end of a day, a successful lobbying blitz creates a surround sound/echo chamber of support/opposition over an issue, ratcheting up the volume and pressure until a member changes their position. At the very least, it makes the vote harder to take, and makes the target legislators less comfortable with holding their ground.

Some lobbying is for show. Some groups just need to go back to their bosses and say, ""We tried."" But rarely will they go all out and spend serious money unless it's actually something important to them."
845,"9/11 is undoubtedly one of the most important events of the 21st century so far. One question that I have is if there can be seen as a correlation, either directly or indirectly of 9/11 leading to Brexit","It's tenuous at best. Remainers have often talked about the xenophobia that fueled much of the Leave talk. But it's not like racism was only invented after 9/11. Certainly there was some increased hostility to immigrants, but much of the UK's issues with xenophobia were economic concerns, not safety. For example, Remainers thought immigrants were stealing jobs in healthcare because the NHS relied on so many foreign workers. If it was 9/11 fueled you'd think it was more about concerns about crime, terrorism, or similar matters, and that just wasn't a big issue in the Brexit debate.

I suppose you could also argue that 9/11 exposed some chinks in the US's armor and the subsequent war in Iraq was a disaster that drove a bit of a wedge between the US and the UK, which facilitated some general discontent in a once-unified NATO bloc, but again...Brexit was leaving the EU, not NATO, and the US isn't part of the EU, so...it's just a really weak connection.

I don't think there's much of an argument you could make here. At the least it's an argument full of holes."
846,"Usually, when I hear of major legislation being passed by a chamber (eg: gun control bill, policing, etc), I always see that it starts its life in the House and then moves to the Senate.

848,"As we all know, the United States Congress consists of two branches: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The latter is usually considered the more prestigious of the two due to having longer terms in office, being smaller in size, and use of statewide constituencies.

But which chamber is actually the most important? While the Senate as mentioned earlier has more prestige, there have also been arguments in favor of the House. Let me know in the comments below.","I think the Senate edges out the House because they confirm Executive appointments.

The House has an edge on paper in that all spending bills must originate in the House. However, in practice spending bills tend to be so complicated to get through both Houses that it has to be a collaboration between the two if the bill has any hopes of passing.

Impeachment is another area where the two chambers have different powers. The House impeaches while the Senate hosts the trial. However, impeachment has rarely had much of a practical impact.

I think on pretty much all other matters the two chambers have virtually the same powers, even if they don't always wield those powers equally.

However, the Senate's ability to block Executive appointments and control confirmations to the Judiciary is a HUGE power that the House does not share."
849,"What initiated this recall? What did Newsom do, and what was the process to trigger a recall? Can this happen in other states?  


Say 49% of people vote not to recall, 51% vote yes, and the highest replacement gets 25% of the votes. Is that person the new governor? If so, isn't that kinda bullshit?  


I'm all for yanking people out of office if they fail their constituents, but it just makes more sense to have a yes/no followed by a new election.","The process to recall is a bit complex. First someone needs to initiate the recall process. This is just filing some paperwork with the state. They then have 160 days to gather enough signatures of registered voters to trigger a recall election. That requires 12% of the number of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election   from at least 5 different counties, and the number of signatures from each county has to be at least 1% of the votes cast from that county. It's a bit complicated, but this ends up being a pretty small percentage of  the total population of California.

Almost every governor of California gets a recall process started against them. Most don't get the signatures required. This attempt wouldn't have, except that the people organizing the recall sued the state claiming that due to COVID 160 days wasn't long enough to gather the signatures. They were granted an extension and were able to get enough then.

If the signatures are gathered and submitted within the 160 day window then a recall election is scheduled. This election has 2 questions. First is ""Should the Governor be removed?"" This just yes/no. If 50%+1 vote yes, then the Governor is removed. If 50%+1 vote no, the governor keeps their job. The second question is, ""If the governor is removed, who should get the job?"" Then a list of all the candidates who have qualified for the ballot. It's actually pretty easy in California to get on the ballot, so this is going to be a lot of names. If the first question results in yes (recall the governor) then the winner of the second is just whoever gets the most votes.

>Say 49% of people vote not to recall, 51% vote yes, and the highest replacement gets 25% of the votes. Is that person the new governor?

Yes, this is exactly how it works. Many people do, in fact, think it is bullshit.

> Can this happen in other states?

Yes, but not in all, and no other state uses an identical system. 

29 states have no recall mechanism at all. 

1 state (Virginia) holds a trial instead of an election. If enough signatures are gathered in VA to trigger a recall (25% of the votes cast in the previous election) the state courts hold a trial. If the judges decide against the Governor, they are immediately recalled and the lieutenant governor takes over. 

In another 13 states they first hold a referendum asking if the governor should be recalled. If the answer is yes, then there is a special election scheduled to select the new governor. In some of these states the recalled incumbent governor can run for their seat back, in some they cannot. In 8 of these states the governor, even if recalled, retains their job until after the special election. In the other 5 they are immediately removed from office and a temporary governor (usually the lieutenant governor) takes the seat until the second election is decided.

The remaining 6 states have a similar process to California where the Yes/No and Who questions are on the same ballot.

In every state the number of signatures needed to initiate a recall and the time frame to get those signatures is different."

852,Al Quaida's primary aim was to end US imperialism in the middle east. But attacking the US on 9/11 jumpstarted US intervention in the MidEast to unprecedented levels and may very well lead to permanent occupation there along the lines of Korea and Japan. It seems clear to me that provoking the US like that was totally counter intuitive if you wanted them to leave you alone so what were Bin Laden and company thinking?,"After bin Laden was killed, we seized a large number of documents in which he outlined his goals and thinking. In terms of 9/11, he wanted to ""break the fear of this false god and destroy the myth of American invincibility."" What he anticipated is that the American public would rise up in opposition to military involvement in the Muslim world, undermining the various authoritarian leaders so that Islamic revolutionaries could take their place. He envisioned that the U.S. would reject Israel and Israel would fall without its economic support.

A good article on it:  
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2021-08-13/osama-bin-ladens-911-catastrophic-success

Note: The notion that bin Laden intended to get the U.S. involved in a series of wars that would bankrupt it was derived from a speech he gave *after* the U.S. had already demonstrated it wasn't going to back away from the Muslim world, it doesn't reflect his strategic thinking in the run-up to 9/11."
853,"Question is WHEN we can see an announcement from him that he's running or not running. Would he wait until after the 2022 midterms? Announce in Summer 2023, same as the timeline he followed in the 2016 race?

FL Congressman Matt Gaetz is close to Trump and said this: ""....he said it’s more likely than not Trump takes the plunge, especially after the 2022 midterm elections if the GOP takes back one or both chambers of Congress""

OH congressman Jim Jordan also was caught on tape saying this: “I know so \[that Trump is going to run again\]. I talked to him yesterday. He's about ready to announce after all of this craziness in Afghanistan.”

And we know already that Trump himself has made his decision already. [https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/561117-trump-says-hes-made-decision-on-2024](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/561117-trump-says-hes-made-decision-on-2024)

So all signs point to him running again, WHEN will he formally announce it?","The usual strategy is to wait as long as you can, because announcing early just puts a target on your back. If Trump announces he's running in 2024 now, it allows Democrats three years to get their base riled up about him, sharpen their attacks on him, get their politicians to fundraise off him, etc. And that's especially bad for him given that he's still banned on Twitter for the time being--his opponents have a platform to attack him there, and he can't counter.

But Trump infamously cares more about ego gratification than strategy. So my guess is that his advisers will try to get him to avoid the topic, and that that will be 75% unsuccessful, because he wants the attention."
854,"Recent polls have had Trudeau and the Liberals down in the polls. While it is close, recent polls have the Conservatives up slightly on the Liberals. Could Trudeau actually lose in an election that he called?","Depends on what your definition of losing is I guess.

It's true that the most recent slate of polling as the horse racing has simmered down show a pretty tight line between the Liberals and Conservatives, though with the Liberals still projected to have a slight lead on seats.

On odds, the CBC's latest is (with huge asterisks of uncertainty):

* 10% Probability of the Liberals winning a majority
* 44% Probability of the Liberals winning the most seats but not a majority
* 41% Probability of the Conservatives winning the most seats but not a majority
* 5% Probability of the Conservatives winning a majority

In my opinion, there's a 'lose' to lose seats but a relatively minor one for the most part, official coalition or not, their centre-left-left tent is still standing strongly enough in that scenario (most likely) to largely survive the majority of their agenda. The 5% of losing to the Conservatives by the Conservatives winning a majority, to me, is the undeniable and actual loss and with that, it's low odds but it's obviously still a possibility.

But still both losses to some degree. He certainly called for the elections with a high hopes of shoring up their mandate, which he may still get, but it certainly doesn't look as sure as it did when he called for them. It wouldn't be the first time a PM has called for a snap election and lost (to varying degrees of what counts as an L)"
855,"The 3 successful military coups so far this year were:

* [1 February in Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Myanmar_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)
* [24 May in Mali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)
* [5 September in Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)

Unlike many other military coups, I can't find solid evidence that foreign powers were inciting these the 3 military coups this year.

Australia's economy is often compared to early 1900s Argentina, and entire [books have been written about this phenomenon](https://twitter.com/Progressive_Con/status/1358620877235970048). Personally, I think the main difference preventing us from going down Argentina's path is that we haven't had a military coup yet. But what actually causes a military coup if there is no external incitement for it? Should I be worried that our military might one day attempt a coup if our economy keeps being like that of early 1900s Argentina?","/u/UmberGryphon's suggestion is an excellent one, and the book that video is based on (The Dictator's Handbook) or its predecessor (The Logic of Political Survival, if you are up for something a bit drier and stat focused) go into greater depth on the subject if it interests you. But to summarize, one of the book's main assertions is to push back on the idea that a dictator has absolute power in their own country (which might undergird the notion that outside intervention is necessary to create a military coup - it's supported by the image that a dictator is all powerful in their own country and can only be kept in check by stronger outside powers). Dictators have a constituency just like democratically elected leaders, but their constituency looks very different and their actions as ruler reflect that. Taking away food from the poor to give it to your highest ranking general (hugely oversimplified example)? Genuinely a terrible idea in a democracy, but a necessary decision for a dictator, because that General could team up with the guy who runs your treasury and effectively pull the country out from under you. If a democratically elected leader does not satisfy their constituency, they are removed from power via election. If a dictator does not satisfy their constituency, they are removed from power via coup.

So to go down the road a little bit with this and try to answer your question, a coup in Australia would reflect a change in Australia's constituency. It's arguably a much more dramatic shift than a fledgling democracy falling back into a dictatorship or one dictator getting replaced by another, and I personally might look more to the economy or environmental/social factors than the existence of other coups this year if I were really concerned about Australia's fate. I don't know enough about Argentina in the 1900s to know if it's an appropriate parallel, but I do tend to be a little skeptical of such comparisons as they're rarely as perfect a fit as they seem to be at first glance. My guess is that if Australia's democratic institutions are so weak that a coup is really in the cards, it'll probably go down in a uniquely Australian way.

As a teeny tiny side note, I do think one of the most underrated elements of Mesquita's books is his discussions on corporate politics and boardrooms, which was understandably overlooked when he had all this interesting stuff to say about dictators. So to anyone who like's CGP Grey's video, the book is really worth a read!"

This seems to just raise the price of an abortion to $10,000, since a person can only be damaged once per abortion, and only people that perform, aid, and abet are the ones actually sued.

The person suing also has to know that a specific woman had an abortion, in which would just drive a a woman to keeping it secret.","I think you're confused about the $10,000 figure--it goes to the person who successfully sues an abortion provider. The provider is on the hook for their own legal fees, which could be any amount of money. 

No providers in the state have a budget that could cover hundreds or thousands of ongoing lawsuits, so they've stopped providing abortions after six weeks."
859,"From what I gather, the general idea is that this new law has created a cause of action wherein any private citizen can sue an abortion provider or anyone who aids or abets an abortion.

So the theory goes that it is difficult to challenge in court, because judicial officers rendering verdicts in such cases are immune from prosecution (Edit to ad) or being sued for doing their job. I assume that the fact that it’s a species of civil claim for damages, as opposed to a criminal charge, is also meant to make it more difficult to challenge.

But what standing do such “plaintiffs” have? A prospective father maybe I would get, but *any* private citizen? Can the Texas state legislature just invent standing for any and everyone?",Not a lawyer but my layman understanding is that the law _by definition_ gives standing to any citizen to bring a suit.

862,"Title is verbatim. 

I understand there are some positions that are either for life or incredibly hard to fire / replace, but is it common for President's to keep some staff from former administrations?

I.e. Does Biden currently have any White House staffers / staff in general from the Trump Administration, did Trump have any from the Obama administration, did Obama have any from the Bush administration, etc, etc.","Throughout the federal government, there are ""political appointees"" and career government officials. Political appointees generally, almost universally, will not stay on when the White house switches party control. Career officials generally do.

For example, since he's been in the news this past year, Dr. Fauci has worked at NIH for decades in various positions. He's a career official setting policy on scientific matters that should be apolitical, so it is a good thing that these positions are not politically appointed.

Most staff that work in the White House are political appointees, so they rotate in and out with the administration.

The only positions that are ""for life"" are in the judiciary."
863,For example Iceland would take forey islands from Denmark.. just curious,"The NATO treaty, article 5:

""The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.""

So if Iceland committed an armed attack against a NATO member, the fact that Iceland is also a NATO member would be irrelevant, and all of NATO would do whatever it took to defend Denmark, up to and including going to war with Iceland."
864,"Shortly after September 11, President Bush told every nation in the world ""Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.""  By refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden, the Taliban decided to be with the terrorists.

Now that the Taliban have taken over Afghanistan, does the US continue to call the Taliban terrorists?  Will the US government recognize the Taliban's government diplomatically with embassies, control of Afghanistan's UN seat, and things like that?

Does the US consider itself to still be at war with the Taliban?  The US may be pulling its boots on the ground out of Afghanistan, but will they continue to fight?  Is it going to be like Korea where the two sides are technically at war but don't actually shoot at each other?  Is the US going to attack Afghanistan continuously with bombers, missiles, drones, and so on as long as the Taliban remain in power?  Is there going to be some kind of peace treaty signed?

What is going to happen to the airport when the US leaves, will they destroy it, or allow it to be captured by enemy forces?  It seems like a *real bad idea* to let the people who brought us 9/11 have any access to airports or airplanes.  Has the US military been seen to take any moves to achieve this, like capturing or destroying any airplane at the airport?  Or warning people that they plan to destroy the airport on their way out?

Will the US allow the Taliban to fly planes, or will they enforce a ""no-fly-zone"" like in the first Gulf War?  It seems reasonable to assume any plane taking off from Taliban controlled territory is on a terrorist mission and shoot it down. 
 Has the US warned the people of Afghanistan that any aircraft will be shot down, or are planes able to take to the skies from Taliban-controlled areas without immediately being fired upon?

If the US doesn't take these extreme measures, shouldn't they be worried about the Taliban sending out waves of suicide planes to attack other countries as soon as they consolidate power in Afghanistan?

[1] https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html","You’re conflating Al Qaeda with the Taliban, the Taliban never flew planes into anything. They gave safe harbor to a terrorist organization that resulted in them having to wage a bloody guerrilla war where they were mercilessly slaughtered for 20 years, hard to imagine they don’t somewhat regret it. They will likely be busy looking inward for a long time. 



Anything anyone has to say about the future is just a guess, but I would assume we will remain hostile to the Taliban while not actively engaging in war-like activity unless some actionable threat is uncovered. We will probably sanction them even further into the Stone Age and do everything we can to prevent them from gaining a seat at the international table. Russia, China and Pakistan will cozy up to them though.

What economical theory where the government can tell people what their jobs are? Like some sort of Human-Resources on a massive scale.

Okay, think about this: Communism in it's simple term makes it so that the workers own the means of production; Socialism would make it so that the public through the government owns the means of production.

What if there is this type of economic theory, that instead of a matter of who controls the means of production, but a matter of who controls the labor power? What good is your factory, if you do not have workers?

As in the government can tell the people what their career would be and their jobs they could take, and what jobs they could accept. That companies would have to go through the government to acquire workers, and thus create artificial scarcity. Alternatively, the government can also create jobs for the people to work.

Maybe ""Authoritarianism"", but I'm asking if there is something else.","That’s interesting. I guess you’re saying it’s a command economy in terms of the labor market, but not in terms of the capital market (where private entities own the factories and other means of production)

Specifically, they say that the appointee for director of the foreign ministry posted on message boards asking for advice on his job. I can't seem to find any articles for this assertion. 

How true is the general assertion that the provisional government was incompetent (or at least grossly underprepared)? How true is the specific assertion that the director of the foreign ministry was googling how to do his job?

EDIT: I just checked the sources for the ""Blowback"" Podcast and found the book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" and on pgs. 39-40, it says:
""David Dunford, a retired ambassador who was put in charge of the Foreign Ministry, was among the fortunate few to receive a briefing packet before his deployment. In it was a four-page memo about the ministry that seemed to Dunford as though it had been written by a summer intern at the State Department. When his requests for more information from State went unanswered, he posted a plaintive query for advice on an Internet message board frequented by Middle East specialists. The gist of his message, Dunford said, was ""Here I am and I don't have a clue as to what to do."" 
The next paragraph talks about Carney, who was appointed to the Ministry of Industry and Minerals, who ""also spent his afternoons in Kuwait trolling the Internet.""

I then found [this interview](https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/histories/iraq/dunford.pdf) where David Dunford discusses getting a 4/5 page document that he believed was prepared by an intern.

Unfortunately, I don't see anything about posting online. Really wish I could find it.","What we tend to believe is that large, complex institutions are best run by smart, competent people.

The reality is that they're not. Indeed, the primary qualifications for those at the top of chain have nothing to do with intelligence or competency but social/political skills to reach and maintain that position. The 'competency' is entirely borrowed from their subordinates and is largely reliant on being just smart enough to listen to what they're saying.

The problem that occurs in places like Iraq is that while there are plenty of people able to operate effectively as a Director of the Foreign Ministry, there's very few people able to operate effectively as part of the *staff* of such an organization. When you're replacing the previous staff wholesale, that means you need to build the institution from scratch without having access to anyone who can actually do the wide array of jobs required.

So while it may seem wrong that a newly appointed Director of the Foreign Ministry was googling how to do his job, this is actually far closer to the norm than you might imagine. Any (decent) senior executive in any institution is going to spend a fair bit of time researching the institution they're chosen to run."

There are an infinite amount of policies that can't be separated by who the voter voted for-- take for example funds allocated to help fight climate change. Tons of Republicans are against spending money on anything to do with that. But that money then goes into projects to reduce C02 being released into the air, less heavy metals in water streams. Every person drinks water, every person breathes. How would they be excluded from this policy? Are they going to stop drinking water and breathing?

Tons of more liberal voters want to reduce police budgets or reallocate the funding for community services. Are police officers going to ask to see their voting record before stopping the person from being assaulted on the street by another stranger?

Long term you could see support for the development of a SWIFT-alternative that was not controlled by the Americans if the Europeans and other important trading nations felt the Americans were no longer trust worthy stewards of such a sytem.   


The Americans are also concerned about pushing the Russians too far with punishments. Sanctions are designed to hurt but the Americans don't want them to hurt so badly that the Russians see military conflict as the only solution to their problem. Does cutting the Russian off from SWIFT or enacting an embargo convince the Russians to change their behavior or does it convince them to double down? If the Russians feel they have nothing else to lose economically why shouldn't they say for example simply take everything in Ukraine east of the Dneiper River? Harsh sanctions could result in the situation becoming worse not better.  


You must also consider the fact that strategically the United States is shifting its focus and resources over to the Pacific to deal with the rising threat of China. While Europe is still an important region for the United States it is significantly less important to them then it was 20-30 years ago. The issues that are happening in Ukraine are much more important to the Europeans and their security then it is to the Americans. If the Europeans do not wish to punish the Russians any more harshly why should the Americans go out of their way to do any more then the bare minimum to secure their own interests?   


Overall, the US hasn't done as much to Russia as they could because their interests have shifted. The Americans have no real interest in starting a Cold War 2.0 at a time when they are in the process of gearing up for a potential fight with the Chinese in the Pacific. They have to balance the desire to deter Russian behavior with the reality that they not want to push them so hard that the security situation in Europe becomes worse."
879,"Obviously in the last few weeks I learned more about the taliban than I did before and please correct me if I’m wrong with the following statement or clarify my thinking. 

From what I read the goal of the Taliban is to take control of Afghanistan and not to force Islam on the world or anything like that. Yes they did practice sharia law and it seems like we’re not sure how they are going to enforce it this time. The point is that their main goal seems to be one that fights for control of Afghanistan and it stops at that. Obviously they’ve done bad things and I don’t want to minimize that, but their actions arnt in the name of Islam like Isis’ actions (I could even be wrong there). The media and the narrative in the United States is that they do all of this in the name of Islam.

So my question is does the world (specifically the Middle East) view the US military as an overtly Christian organization and the things we do as a reflection of the religion?","
>From what I read the goal of the Taliban is to take control of Afghanistan and not to force Islam on the world or anything like that.

Technically, that is false. 

The fundamentalist branch of Sunni Islam the Taliban believe in commands that every person on Earth must convert to Islam, by force if necessary. 

The Taliban aren't stupid enough to believe they can actually do that, but they believe in the goal enough to shelter terrorist groups like Al Qaeda who effectively wished to spread Islam through force. 

>So my question is does the world (specifically the Middle East) view the US military as an overtly Christian organization and the things we do as a reflection of the religion?

The Taliban is an explicitly theocratic government. The USA is a secular government. 

No sane or credible person considers the Western coalition in Afghanistan to be a Christian crusading army."
880,"If you look at the natural resources of these countries, they hardly lack anything. They should be totally self-dependent, in theory. However, that's not the case. All of these countries try to meddle in other countries, only just the levels of meddling is limited. May be US the highest with India the least. 

Why haven't these countries managed to become self-sustainable?","No country has 100% of all its needs. The US still imports more crude oil then we export, for example but export more refined oil products. Also several things (like touch screens on cell phones) require trace elements that are either damaging to the environment to mine, or by products of mining of other things that damages the environment as well. US regulations make it expensive to do that domestically (which we totally could), but other countries can do it for cheaper since they don't care about the environment like we do."
881,"The Montreux Convention signed in 1936 restricts Turkey from charging fees for passage through the Bosporus Strait in the heart of Turkey, and puts some restrictions on the types of foreign military ships from passing through. For these reasons, both the US and Turkey are unhappy with the limitations, to the point that Turkey is constructing a 10 billion dollar canal just 30 miles away from the Bosporus Strait (with blackjack and hookers?), and recently arrested 10 generals who opposed its construction.

My question is, who is enforcing the Montreux Convention? What would happen if Turkey were to just do whatever they wanted?","Ultimately, if it were important enough, let's just say there would indeed be military vessels passing through the Bosporus Strait.

Anyhow, this is like any other question of law- you can argue what's legal and illegal, right and wrong all day, but ultimately laws don't enforce themselves. Some entity has to enforce them.

884,"[RealClearPolitics version seems to average the last 5 polls and charts it.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html) As we know, not all polls are equal and frame the question in different ways, have different sampling biases, etc...  There doesn't seem to be editorializing other than they don't let the same pollster represent themselves twice in the averaging the calculation.

[Five Thirty Eight's (538) version seems to be completely editorialized.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?cid=rrpromo) They personally edit the results of every single poll (like literally, they change every poll's results), and weight how much the poll should affect the rating based on how much they ""trust"" the pollster.

Well, here is how each one looked in the last two presidential elections vs the result that actually happened:

2016 Presidential Election:

||Clinton|Trump|(other)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ACTUAL 2016 Popular Vote|48.2%|46.1%|5.7%|
|[Five Thirty Eight (538) rating on election day](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/)|45.7%|41.8%|12.5%|
|[Real Clear Politics rating on election day](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_clinton-5491.html)|46.8%|43.6%|9.6%|

In the 2016 election, Five Thirty Eight VASTLY over estimated the amount of 3rd party/nonvotes and VASTLY underrated Trump's support. RealClearPolitics also overestimated the (other) column, but overall was far more accurate.

2020 Presidential Election:

||Biden|Trump|(other)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ACTUAL 2020 Popular Vote|51.3%|46.9%|2.3%|
|[Five Thirty Eight (538) rating on election day](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/national/)|51.8%|43.3%|4.9%|
|[Real Clear Politics rating on election day](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html)|51.2%|44.0%|4.8%|

In the 2020 election, the differences were less dramatic and they both overestimated the (other) column, but yet again RealClearPolitics was slightly more accurate.

My conclusion is that even if 538's numbers are more correct in 2024, it is because a broken clock is right twice a day. 538's methods are junk, which have produced junk results.","Two presidential elections is hardly a robust measure, particularly when you cherry pick data like this. 538 was well known for correctly stating time and again that Trump had a better chance to win in 2016 than most folks would admit largely because of the possibility that he wins the EC but loses the popular vote, and that's exactly what happened. You're also only looking at the popular vote in one race and not looking at other information like House or Senate races or state-level polling.

But overall, the main reason this post is junk is because you're actually not measuring the right thing. 538 never claims that their polls are a direct prediction for the popular vote. They have said very specifically that there are many flaws with such a method, which is why they instead produce a model to predict the outcome of the election. You can see that here:

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/)

It very clearly projects a popular vote of 48.5% for Clinton, a less than 1 point difference from the actual outcome. You're right that they were further off for Trump, but their 44.9% was closer than RCP's 43.3%. 

Further, the way 538 adjusts polls has little to do with their own interpretative license and more to do with regular mathematic adjustments. When they see that a poll produces consistently skewed results compared to actual, they will ""adjust"" the poll to show the result without their historic and consistent polling error. This is a mathematically sound process that is explained on their pollster rating page here:

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/)

I could go further into the math and bring up more examples from the 2020 election to show how you're using the data wrong, but I think I've shown my point well enough. 538 does a great job explaining the math behind this stuff and I recommend you take a look at more of their content that talks about how polling data is used in the field because it will teach you a lot. It's not their fault you're using a hammer on a screw and claiming nails are better."
885,"For those who are new to American politics let me explain. After Trump was elected back in 2016 we saw a wave of more liberal Democrats start to win in primaries, and even in general elections. Probably the most famous example was the 2018 midterms which saw a wide variety of progressives win house seats from either primarying incumbents or filling vacant ones in blue districts. Not only was it present in the house, but in pretty much every field. It seemed that perhaps the Democratic party had chosen to go down a more progressive path and it was only a matter of time until the Democrats were a fully progressive party, lead by Bernie Sanders.

But that all seemed to change in 2020. Joe Biden, the perceived moderate won the primary and went on the win the general. Progressive primaries seemed to slow to just a couple of victories. And this trend has seemingly only continued this year. In Virginia, a blue state many progressives who had won state seats in 2017 lost to establishment candidates in the primary this year. In a special Ohio race, the progressive candidate lost even after leading by double digits pretty much the entire time.

So what happened?","Well I think the problem is that the progressive movement was portrayed as more widespread than it actually is. 

 Progressives tend to be a bit louder and more vocal about their beliefs, and frequently attack the Democratic establishment. This gets them lots of media coverage. In relation to the media coverage conservative media like Fox News use them as a bogeyman. 


    But it wasn’t the progressives that won the Democrats the House in 2018. Many of the progressives were from safe blue districts. 


 Moderate Democrats were more likely to flip GOP seats. Most of the Democratic caucus is moderate. The progressives are a minority albeit a vocal one. 

  Progressives and their fans tend to be younger too. The fact is that younger people aren’t the most reliable voters when it comes to turnout. Older people are and they tend to be moderate. 


   But it should be considered that in recent years the Democratic Party has moved significantly to the left. Biden is a moderate in today’s party but he’s much more left leaning than Obama was when he first ran. Some of his positions would’ve been unthinkable in the Obama years. 

  Progressives are a minority. But they have influenced moderate Democrats to move more left."

888,"I haven't heard 'civic responsibility', 'social contract', or any other related concepts discussed when addressing the 'anti-mask' and 'anti-vax' movements related to COVID. Most coverage includes protesters hoisting signs that generally demand the right to make their own choices. Rebuttals appear to only focus on vaccine and mask effectiveness statistics to demonstrate why those choosing not to use these devices are wrong. (Maybe my online behavior creates a biased filter, not afraid to be proven wrong on this)

Shouldn't there be a bigger conversation around the balance between individual rights and civic responsibility? Isn't it entirely appropriate to allow individual rights within the confines of their private spaces (e.g. their homes), but fully expect behavior that aligns with socially agreed upon best practices?

I fully understand the challenge of identifying and agreeing on anything as a society, especially in the US right now, but that doesn't even seem to be a part of the discussion.","I definitely have heard arguments about civil responsibility, and attacks on anti-vaxers/maskers as selfish, but I think the reason this hasn't been the focus of the debate is that it's not the main argument that anti-vaxers/maskers make. 

There are people who think it's wrong to mandate masks or vaccines, but we don't think of them as part of the Covid skeptic movement, because they are not refusing to mask or get vaccines. 

The people who go out protesting these things, ultimately don't believe in the science behind vaccines and masks, so reasoning with them about civic responsibility is pointless. They reject the premise that widespread masking and vaccination, even if it was wrong to mandate, would be beneficial."
889,"Withdrawal was inevitable. I know that was an eventuality, but we all saw the media images of Afghanis trying to get on the C130 and the other video clips that were similar to the fall of Saigon. They were traumatic. I have seen the perspective that the United States could have started processing visas months ago and evacuated the Afghanis in a more orderly fashion. I don't want to ascribe to this knee-jerk because I don't know the specs of the circumstances on the ground. Was such a more orderly evacuation possible?","The United States has been processing these visas for years. Specific evacuation flights started last month, and thousands have already been relocated to the US. It's not that the government hasn't been doing it, it's just not enough to keep up with demand. Before recent events, it took about three years on average to get the visa. There's a ton of paperwork and security checks to get through. Obviously in recent months a bunch more people are applying, which has expanded the queue even more.

A more orderly evacuation was possible--but likely would have required the cooperation of Congress changing the laws on how many visas they allow. The Biden administration couldn't have done it singlehandedly.

In addition to that--a lot of the people in those chaotic airport scenes weren't people who qualified for the visa program in the first place. They were just random Afghans trying to escape the country. They may eventually make it out to another country (possibly the US, possibly not) as a refugee. But they were not going to be affected by the visa program, and it's unlikely the Biden administration could have done much to avoid the airport scenes that resulted from that."
890,"CONTEXT: I'm not an American but I'm a keen follower of US politics and consider that I have a reasonable working knowledge of American politics.

Today and in the wake of the Afghanistan withdrawal I [saw an article](https://redstate.com/joesquire/2021/08/17/the-worst-part-the-democrats-cant-use-the-25th-amendment-n428007) that pointed to a potential problem for Democrats should they choose to remove the President via the mechanism of the 25th Amendment. The 'problem' for the Democrats essentially came down to how the Vice President would be replaced as the 25th Amendment demands approval of the President's nomination by a majority in both the House and the Senate, and the Senate is split 50/50. If President Biden was removed and VP Harris became President Harris, the new VP nomination would have to be someone that at least one Republican Senator could live with - and the article suggested that was unlikely to be a good thing for the Democrats.

To be clear, I don't think that President Biden is about to be removed or that this 'problem' is anything more than a hypothetical right now. 

Still, I have a couple of questions about this 'what if' scenario:

1. Is there another way to 'break a tie' in a Senate split 50-50 without a VP? Would it be possible for the Democrat Senators just to wait until a GOP Senator was out of town, sick in hospital, or overseas and call the vote, or would Senate rules disallow this?
2. Is it an obligation to govern with a VP or could President Harris just govern without one? If she could, would the next slot in the line of succession just 'skip' to the Speaker of the House?
3. Is there a chance that, in the current political context, any replacement VP nominee would garner sufficient votes in the Senate to be confirmed?","I live for moments of finding vulnerabilities in constitutional processes as written .  I'm amazed this never crossed my mind until now.  I too would really like to know what others find because I can't think of anything at the moment.  
Considering it halts a LOT of the process since the Senate would be functionally deadlocked for everything, I imagine many laymen will ask the supreme court to weigh in somehow, even though they probably shouldn't.  Whether the supreme court would try and influence anything is unlikely in my eyes, but still well within the realm of possibility."

894,"The US constitution has undoubtedly had a profound influence on the governments of other countries with many government taking parts of it and applying it to their own systems of government and constitution.

The question I am asking is how many exactly had the US's direct involvement in the drafting process?

The most famous examples I know of are Iraq's and Japan's constitution which the US helped draft and implement following the end of their respective wars with the US.

An interesting side note being that most of the democracies the US installed have been parliamentary systems i.e. Iraq, Japan, and Afghanistan (RIP) which I personally find amusing that even US officials prefer it at least for other countries.

So essentially, how many of those cases like Japan/Iraq are there and how many still have US written/directly influenced constitutions around today?","It's a bit hard to answer this question. I mean, before the US, there wasn't even a concept of a constitution at all in government. When the French Revolution kicked off right after the US won the war, US delegates did help them craft a constitution...but that was then abandoned shortly after the Revolution turned into the Terror. But the French Revolution was arguably the most significant international event of the century, and from that point forward, constitutions became a central point of government organization, even to the point that folks will assert they can exist in even *unwritten* form.

And then fast forward to the modern era. When WW2 ended and Ho Chi Minh was frustrated with French colonial rule and wanted independence for French Indochina, he approached Truman by appealing to the words of Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence to implore him to use the UN to help Vietnam secure independence. The US turned him down.

The point is that it's almost impossible to answer this question definitively. What we can say is that the American Revolution was a major catalyst in the French Revolution, and the French Revolution changed the world, and in the modern era, constitutions are a staple of democratic governments. You could make an argument that the existence of any constitution at all comes in part from American influence, even if you don't have a direct tie between, for example, Brazilian officials and the US Constitution."

Nationalism has gone hand in hand with the independence movements of the 20th century, notably with purported communist revolutions (Vietnam), the former colonies of what was the British Empire (Nigeria) and the dissolution of socialist regimes in the '80s and '90s (Yugoslavia). However, as smaller and smaller regions and ethnic groups demand their sovereignty, the emphasis on nation-states comes into conflict with the international community's preference for territorial integrity (the UN usually wants states and their borders to be remain fixed). States as entities have staying power, and leaders can offer semiautonomy to minorities rather than engage in costly wars or suffer loss of territory (locally-administered Northern Ireland)."

The terrain is very rough and mountainous.  It thus does not serve as a practical route for transporting things.  It was never meant to anyway.  That panhandle was created not to give Afghanistan a border with China, but to create a buffer zone between the Russian Empire and the British Empire (this happened back in 1893).  The Russians couldn't send troops into India without also intruding on Afghan territory.

901,"Some parties call for balancing the budget as a top priority, but why should I care? I would assume spending and investing in people automatically benefits the economy. Would my life be better if the budget was balanced?","The economic idea behind a balanced budget is to prevent runaway deficit spending and potential inflation caused by high deficit spending, and to keep investors who buy government debt through treasury securities confident that they will be paid back. This also allows greater leeway for the nation to deficit spend when the next recession hits. 

But the most ardent supporters of balanced budgets also have an ideological goal in mind. Balanced budgeting can be a tool to limit spending and the size of the government and to prevent deficit spending which would require future taxation to pay off. 

Most economists will tell you that balanced budgets aren't always good. In times of recession, deficit spending allows the state to stimulate the economy while delaying taxation or spending cuts in other areas that would reduce the efficacy of the stimulus. The inflationary pressure of deficit spending is also curbed by the downward pressures on the economy caused by recession.  

Do we need a balanced budget right now? No. The economy is in a period of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now is when deficit spending is the most useful.

The big debate going on right now isn't about balancing the budget, but if we are spending too much. The United States has a great level of debt already and skeptics of the dollar amount of recent spending bills like Larry Summers have warned that we may be overheating the economy and heading toward an inflation spike that would devalue the stimulus. 

Others, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, believe inflation won't continue at its current pace and will eventually subside as supply shortages end."
