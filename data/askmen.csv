0,Announcing the 2023 Official /r/AskMen Demographics Survey!,Removed google account requirement. Captcha question is at end of survey.
1,THERE WILL BE NO MORE ROMAN EMPIRE QUESTIONS. POST ONE AND YOU WILL GET BANNED.,"What the hell is a roman empire question?

I'm out of the loop on this.

I'm guessing it's not literally about the roman empire because I don't see many history based questions on here. Especially about the roman empire. 

Most questions I see are either  ""Men, what attracts you to a woman"" or stuff like that or questions that literally murder Rule # 4 and treat this sub as VentToMen

I don't use and never used TikTok so that is why I'm probably have no idea what this is about."
2,How much money should one spend on an engagement ring realistically?,I would just look for a nice quality ring that you can actually afford
3,"Men of reddit, at what age did you have your first girlfriend?","Didn't have my first kiss until I was 22. Didn't lose my virginity until I was 23, and didn't have my first serious relationship until 25. I'm now 27 and on the verge of being engaged. I was behind all of my buddies when it came to this stuff, and now I'm in a very happy relationship. Everyone moves at their own pace. It really doesn't matter when you reach these milestones, just as long as you make sure to take care of your body and mind!"
4,"Men of Reddit, what’s your opinion on the “you’ll find a relationship when you aren’t looking” technique?","The advice is loaded with the assumption that the person being advised has an active social life where they meet new people regularly.

So it is useless when the advisee's default state is one of going to work, going home, doing socially isolated activities, and repeat week by week. Changing or adding on to those routines to create a life where they can meet new people is where advice should be targeted.

Saying this to someone without considering their current behaviors is just a shot in the dark; ignorance at best and dismissive at worst."
5,"People talk about the death of ""third spaces"", what third spaces still exist?","3rd space as in other than home and work. Well, there is the gym. The girlfriends place if she doesn't live with you.

But for me, I have a buddy who is divorced. He has made his new home into a gathering place for his buddies to watch sports, play games like dungeons and dragons which he is now running, drink, relax, BBQs, a jumping off point for some golf, nights out, special events like ComicCon or Truck shows, etc. Better than a dive bar."
6,"As a man, at what point do you say this relationship with this woman is not working for me?",When communication doesn't work anymore. This is the point of no return.
7,"Former skinny guys, what did you do to gain weight?","I started eating more calories and protein.

Doing sports helped too."
8,"Men of Reddit, what quote resonates with you the most?","*“Maybe that’s enlightenment enough: to know that there is no final resting place of the mind; no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom...is realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have yet to go.”*

-Anthony Bourdain"
9,"Men who have only had one partner because they found their SO early in life, why or why not do you regret not having been with more women?","No regret. She was the first person I wanted to be with, and the only ever since."
10,What's something that happened to you that changed you as a man,The death of my son.
11,"Men of Reddit, what's the biggest sacrifice you ever made for love?","I stopped doing all my hobbies that cost money and stopped eating lunch at work, so i could get the money together to pay for my daughter's prom dress"
12,Men without kids what motivates you to get out of bed everyday?,"I prefer having a roof over my head and food in my stomach, so I don't have much choice."
13,"Those still in the dating market, what behaviours/traits of a woman instantly gets them friends-with-benefits zoned?",When they leave and then come back in your life repeatedly. I loved this one girl with all my heart and she played that game. Eventually I realized that I was an uncertainty in her life and would rather smoke my cigar alone and get high than have my heart ripped out again by her.
14,"Men, What is tv shows do you like to watch with your S.O?",Ted Lasso
15,"Men, how do you find meaning in a world that's all digital?","I refuse to believe that most people never leave their house lol sounds like you are basing the world off of your social circle. The digital world didn't kill my IRL world, it just made it easier to plan around it with communication/texts."
16,Men who wanted kids but weren’t able to have them. How have you coped with that? How has it been?,"This kinda goes against the thread but it's a supportive message so whatever.

My wife and I struggled to get pregnant and stay pregnant for about 10 years, but after 2 rounds of IVF from which we were able to successfully get a total of 2 embryos, she's now 14 weeks along 🙏

Couple that with how lots of employer's insurances are starting to cover IVF, IUI, and other infertily treatments - I'm just here to say that if you're struggling remember there are options out there and all it takes is 1 Hail Mary to make it work."
17,"Men who choose to be single, how do you deal with the occasional loneliness?","I stay busy, work on myself all the time, I no longer chase women. It's very peaceful."
18,How often do you turn a woman down who was trying ti sleep with you?,">What was the reason for saying no?

I don't like casual sex and I have preferences."
19,"My most hated song is Poor Some Sugar on me, whats yours?","Sail by Awolnation. Fucking hated that song since the beginning....people loved this song back in the day during the Stomp Clap Hey! Era.

Edit:

Oh yeah an 7 years old by Lukas Graham. It's too much cheese for me."
20,What happened after your So got too comfortable in the relationship?,"She slowly started moving in her things little by little, and by the time I realized it, she had basically moved in and she never left."
21,How often do you change your bedsheets?,"Every other week.

I shower before bed, and I don't bring food or drink into the bedroom(except water)."
22,What’s a chore you hate but are good at?,"All of them. Chores aren't hard, they're just never ending"
23,"Fellas who did a restart on your life in your 30s-40s-50s (or even later), what prompted you to do so? And how did it play out?","I filed for divorce after catching my wife cheating.  I owned 2 businesses with 16 employees, everything had to be sold so she could get half of everything.  I took 2 years off, finished my degree and build a new house.  Without having to provide for a wife I was able to retire at 54."

25,Do you know when you’ve developed “dad strength” or is it just commented on by others?,"What if dad strength. I’ve been a dad for years, never heard this phrase.

Do you mean old man strength?"
26,What are some expectations that men have when living with your significant other?,We'll split the chores and close the bathroom door when pooping.

28,How did girls mocking you affect your life and confidence?,"Yes it did affect me. I was interested in a girl and we went out on a date. I genuinely asked if she enjoyed herself and I received a screenshot of my message with a bunch of laughing and vomit emojis. She had screenshot my message and sent it into a group chat with her friends making fun of me.

The one thing i won’t do is sit around dwelling on it, always makes it worse for me"
37,What’s your biggest regret with a crush you had?,"That I didn't ask her for a date in high school because I thought she'd say no.  Years later, after we were both married, we crossed paths and talked and, from what she said, I think she would have said yes had I asked back in high school."
38,What kind of issues does lack father figure/father create ?,"> What kind of issues does lack father figure/father create

The correlation between lack of father figure and increased likelihood of criminality has been known for literal *decades* now, and there's a lot of research backing it up.

https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_dailyplanetblog%26view%3Dentry%26category%3Dindustry%2520news%26id%3D54

The outcomes and impact are not good. 

At least from what I've read, absent fathers and otherwise single-parent households has a disproportionate statistical negative effect on boys compared to girls.

This is the first one I came across on a quick google, but it was interesting reading the actual report (linked PDF on the page).

https://ifstudies.org/blog/disentangling-the-effects-of-family-structure-on-boys-and-girls

Some quotes from the report itself:

> Furthermore, the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood and a measure of racial animus are the two strongest predictors of mobility rates for black boys. This doesn’t discount the importance of policy but rather makes the point that cultural factors are also critically important.

.

> Several recent studies indicate that growing up outside a family with two biological, married parents yields **especially negative consequences for boys as compared to girls**, including worse educational outcomes and higher rates of criminal involvement.

.

> A detailed look at three recent studies contextualized by broader evidence reveals the emerging consensus that **the absence of a biological father in the home yields especially negative consequences for boys**. These consequences are seen in disruptive and delinquent behavior, and they persist into adult educational attainment and employment.

.

> Wasserman describes mechanisms that may link family structure to children’s outcomes, in terms of both the main effect and gender differences. These include same-gender role models (in the household and in the neighborhood), parental resources (income and other), parenting quantity/quality (including parental time allocation by child gender), and the differential responsiveness of boys to parental inputs, among other hypotheses.

.

> Researchers have only recently begun to study the mechanisms that lie behind boys’ and girls’ differential responses to family structure. The evidence so far indicates that gender gaps in resources within the family—such as parents’ time—don’t vary meaningfully across family structures. And to the extent that boys and girls are allocated different resources in the family, **these differences don’t appear to account for boys’ particularly negative response to growing up outside a two-parent home.**

.

> In assessing how family structure could affect boys’ and girls’ outcomes differently, we look within family environments, seeking differences by child gender in the provision or allocation of inputs. Do boys and girls have different experiences, even in the same family structure category? Alternatively, are there gender differences in the benefits derived from inputs? That is, do boys and girls have different responses to similar family environments? I’ll also discuss how mechanisms external to the family can cause family structure to have different ramifications for boys and girls.

.

> **In summary, recent evidence consistently shows that two-parent married families confer differential benefits for the behavioral, educational, and labor market outcomes of boys relative to girls. The disproportionate effects of family structure appear as early as age five, when children are assessed for kindergarten readiness. Though the effects are primarily concentrated among behavioral outcomes, including school suspensions and delinquency, we also have evidence that such effects persist into adulthood, as measured by high school completion and employment at age 30.**


There's more. A lot more. It's worth a read. There's a lot of theory as to *why* it's happening, but there's no real doubt that there are factual differences as a result. In particular, I would recommend page 67 onwards (""Evidence that Family Structure Affects Boys and Girls Differently"").

The report refers primarily to boys children growing up outside of a standard 2-parent model, however the vast majority of these are fatherless homes. And that regardless of whether it's fatherless or motherless home, boys are *disproportionately* affected compared to girls.

There is disproportionate affect to boys that are raised in two-parent families compared to girls. Statistically, boys lose out more with absent parents.


EDIT: From Harvard:

https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hendren/files/mobility_geo.pdf

> The fraction of children living in single-parent households is the single strongest correlate of upward income mobility among all the variables we explored, with a raw unweighted correlation of -0.76 (see Online Appendix Figure XIIa for the corresponding non-parametric binned scatter plot).

Again, talks about single parent families but the vast majority of those are fatherless families."
39,Men who proposed to SO and she said no. What’s your current situation with her?,"This happened to a friend of mine recently, they had been together for 6 years. The first time, she figured out that he was shopping for a ring and told him he should save his money instead. The second time several months later…she laughed at him and broke it off, and had a new boyfriend by the end of the week. I had a feeling that this would happen when I heard of her reaction the first time, but it still hurts to see him go through this."
40,"When it slowly dawned on you that a friend is mental, what did you do about it?","Depends on what you're talking about here. For some where they were just a bit _too_ out there, we slowly drifted because we weren't vibing anymore. For a friend who was genuinely psychotic and a risk to herself, I called up the proper authorities to get her sectioned."
41,"Men of reddit, what did you do when you realized you've fallen out of love?","Hard to make a LDR work after you realise you're falling out. She was much more emotionally vulnerable and physically comfortable with her best friend than me, kind of a deal breaker for me. Breaking up was good, she was a great one but the woman kind of lacked a sort of sense I can't quite explain."
42,What aspect of your life changed the most after having kids?,"I no longer lived for myself. I used to make decisions based entirely on how I would benefit from them. After kids, I now make these decisions with their interest. I sacrifice to help bring them better lives."
43,How do you stay motivated at your job?,"Compensation.

It used to go a lot further, even for shitty jobs.

If a job isn’t worth it *to you*, do something different.

There’s no shame in that."

47,"(Serious) Men who don’t wash their hands after they pee, why?","Wise mechanic once said ""Wash hands first or you have greasy dick."""
48,"Men who have been in a work rut and escaped, what changed?","I made a list of companies that I wanted to work for. I searched their job listings and started to pay attention to what they were looking for.

I took classes to learn what I didn't know. I expanded my network to meet people that may know someone. 

Basically whatever I could do to set myself up as a desirable candidate for the day I saw a listing that I wanted to apply for."
49,How do deaf from birth people interpret subtitles saying a certain genre of music is playing,"I guess, when it comes to say metal, you can read about metal and what kind of themes it usually represents, maybe read something about subcultures and what type of people metal usually is listened by. So then by reading a sub like ""happy metal theme"" they can assume this is something unusual.

But for something vast and varied like rock - no idea."
50,What’s the pros and cons of being in a relationship with a police officer?,"Pros. Access to handcuffs. 

Cons. The hours they work can suck"
51,"Young men of Reddit, Why is it fun to stay at YMCA?","there's no need to feel down
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man, 'cause you're in a new town
There's no need to be unhappy"
52,At what level do you set your phone volume to when listening through earphones?,Don’t have earphones on my phone. But i don’t usually go above 50% for sound anyway.
53,Never mind your V-card : how did your first kiss happen?,I was in the second grade. One girl held me down while the other kissed me…….been begging to relieve that moment as an adult ever since

55,"What unscented deodorant do you use with your cologne, why?","I use whatever one I can find. Sometimes Walmart will strangely not have any mend unscented deoderant. Sometimes I use a womens unscented, or an unscented from Whole Foods."
56,What's a quote or saying that will summarise you and your life?,"There isn't always a light at the end of the tunnel, but if you keep going, your eyes will adjust and you can get comfortable walking in the dark"
57,"Men of Reddit, what is something that you will just not tolerate no matter what?","Any type of abuse whether it be verbal or physical. I don’t let anyone yell, scream, or talk to me in a disrespectful way."
58,"Men aged 28-50, how long do you start to take the relationship more seriously while dating someone and what do you consider a LTR?",I’m serious about every relationship from the start
59,What are mistakes girls should avoid in the first couple months of dating?,"Be yourself.  No, seriously.  Don't set expectations somewhere the fuck else, and then they get committed to a version of you that never existed."
60,How was your summer on a scale of 1 to 5 and why?,"2 i'm an adult, working my shitty adult job, making my shitfy adult pay."
61,"Single men who aren’t on any social media, what is your reason?",it's fucking toxic and basically just a thirst trap
62,(Serious) What was your experience with a woman creep?,"I'm a dentist and a few times I've had ladies really lay it on. I've been sent multiple friend requests on Facebook, and then be pissed when I told her that our relationship is a professional one. I've had one write her phone number and give to my dental assistant to give to me. I've had several show up wearing very little/inappropriate clothing, which also progressed over time to wearing more provocative things. 

Finally, I had one young woman that the entire time I was working was staring deeply into my eyes. It honestly felt like she was looking deep into my soul. It was uncomfortable and strange. After a while I realized she was actually just watching the reflection of what I was doing in my glasses. Lol."
63,"Adding up all close friends, casual friends, acquaintances and work/business contacts, how many phone contacts do you have?","601 according to my iPhone, built up over last 10 years. 

I work so much that 2-3-4 all get blended together into a slurry of blurred lines. But that also means that I realistically have only a couple people that fit into category 1."
64,How do you add a healthy sense of power and agency to your life?,Try quitting a habit
65,How do you get your lady in the “mood”?,Apparently all I have to do is leave the house.
66,"if you are deaf, what language do you think in and are you able to phonetically pronounce it correctly?",The human body can feel sound waves. But without a working ear system it can’t be understood like people who can. So its possible that language is felt by them and probable will represent what they feel most. English will feel like english and other languages wont. But only if the deaf person is able to feel the language. Soft spoken or speaking away from them garnishes nothing.
67,What bad habits are you struggling to quit and why?,"This is pretty innocuous, but something I've been trying to work on. FWIW I have a stupidly overactive imagination and it bleeds into real life sometimes. 

I will embellish stories, or tell stories that never actually happened, but wanted to happen. More often than not it's just embellishing things to make them sound cooler than they were. I have no idea when I started doing this, I don't know WHY I do it, but I am working on it. 

I'm a boring human, that craves to do the things my imagination produces. It's annoying any tiring. 

It should be noted, I only do this on stories from my past, so it's not anything current or anything big."
68,What video game do you play (if any) after a long day of work?,Doom is always good fun
69,What are your non-negotiables in terms of maintaining friendship with another man?,"1. Being emotionally or physically abusive to others.

2. Making inappropriate or offensive comments about my family, friends or partner"
70,"Men who've used a professional matchmaker or matchmaking service, what was it like?","There’s routinely more women than men in these services so they’re almost always desperate for men to join. So it sounds like shooting fish in a barrel. The catch is that most of these professional women are extremely picky and still think they’re better than most of the men also using the service. 

So matching will still be hard unless you’re attractive. You do get some perks as they usually have in person events and you can use social skills to bypass a bit of their pickiness. But you’ll usually have to still aim down instead of up like women aim. So if you’re also a picky man or want an equally attractive partner you’ll most likely still end up frustrated. But it’s still a numbers game. Some of those women, the older they are, the more realistic they are."
71,What is the least 'Manly' thing about you?,"My passivity, I'm more or less unwilling to be all that proactive or assertive about anything important."
72,What are the best Sidequests you can think of?,"When on vacation, the things that bartenders and waiters tell you that you simply must do that you had not planned on doing.

When I was in Iceland, one waitress sent me to an abandoned warehouse area where all the buildings had been painted with amazing graffiti. I’d never get that out of a guidebook."
73,For what reasons would you tell your female friend about your dating life?,"If you can't talk to a friend, are they really a friend?"
74,What's your I was almost rich story?,"Friend was big into mining bitcoin in like early 2010, offered me to jump on board and help invest in a set up for 500 pounds. I don’t know exactly how much he has made out of it, but he was smart and sold some off, held some and sold a large chunk in 2021, all I know is he is mid 30s retired with houses in Mexico, UK and France, and I work 9-6"
75,Men who pee sitting? Why?,Because I clean my own bathroom
76,What shampoo do you often use? And how do you apply it?,I use Pantene shampoo and I apply it by rubbing it around in my wet hair

78,"men of reddit, what do you imagine period cramps feel like?",Like a diarrhea cramp coupled with getting punched in the gut all day
79,"What’s the biggest age difference you’ve hook-up, had a FWB, or had a relationship with? Any differences you noticed compared to your close-in-age counterparts?","I was 28, she was 40. Nice while it lasted."
80,What movie sequel is better than the first film (other than Shrek 2)?,Terminator 2
81,What is your preference on talking to your barber while they are cutting your hair?,My barber is the youngest person I know other than grandkids. I pepper her with questions about what the world is really like. She answers and then I leave my apology tip. It's not a lot to pay for intel.
82,How do you discretely ask a girl if they have a boyfriend?,"If she has a boyfriend she will tell you when you ask her out. ""I'm sorry but I have a boyfriend"". There is no reason to disguise your intentions."
83,"Men who used to fuck around, how did you realize you met the one and want to settle for her?","Ive had some severe commit issues, and never held a relationship longer than a month. FWB off and on for years with quite a few women. I always hated putting in effort to women, because when i had in the past. It felt wasted. 

3 months in, and the moment i realized i met the one was because I was doing things for her and it didnt feel like effort. Shes always done morning Crossfit classes and i always did the afternoon ones (minus saturdays which are 8:00am, its how we met.)

When i first stayed over, she made us iced coffee in the morning, I watched how she did it.

The next time and ever since then, I do it every morning for her before i leave. Little did I know shes an acts of service type and she immediately fell in love with me realizing i like making her life easier.

Apparently im the first man shes ever had who does things for her without her asking lol."
84,What's you favorite thing to be called by your SO?,"My fiancé calls me beans, because she came into the bedroom one day when I was napping and took a picture of me all wrapped up in the blankets and she said I looked like a little burrito 🤣 

I don’t know why it makes me so happy, but it does"
85,"Men of reddit, what insecurities do/did you deal with? How did you get over it?","Massive insecurity I had was how frail I looked. It made me intimidated and afraid of confrontation. 

7 years of powerlifting and 5 years of Muay Thai, Wrestling, and BJJ and I am not afraid of any sort of conflict. Not that it would resort to violence, but having that safety net in the back of my mind knowing that they can only get so mad makes it easier to embrace the conflict and work out resolutions"
86,What is something that you are good at?,[deleted]
87,Why do you think that boys/men struggle to find good role models?,"Society is on a rampage for attacking male role models lately.

The only ones I see get a free pass on social media basically worship women socially. Nothing else they do seems to really matter much.

That said I think a lot of guys do have men they admire they just don't discuss it online anymore because everyone knows it'll turn into a shitshow for the reasons mentioned above."
88,"If your son came to you and told you he was getting bullied, how would you handle it?","Lol this reminds me of when I was little and had a bully taking food out of my lunch

Dad: “Did you tell him to stop?   Did you tell a teacher?  And it’s still happening? 

…go get a milk carton, then dump it on his head in front of the entire school.”

Probably not the best fatherly advice but it still makes me chuckle 20+ years later."
89,"Men of reddit, how long do you spend on the toilet?",At home 5-8 min. At work 20 min.
90,What changes or improvements would you like to see in your community?,"For me personally, a truck stop near my house would be nice.

Generally speaking, it would benefit the whole community if someone just burned down the meth head neighborhood."
91,What is the weirdest compliment you've gotten or heard someone else get?,She told me I kinda look like a serial killer but in a good way.
92,What’s something you shouldn’t say while your wife is giving birth?,"From experience, basically anything."

94,When is the last time you begged for something?,2 years ago. I begged God to please bring my dad back. He had just died of covid.
95,What are ways to build attraction on a first date?,"The most important thing is appearance. Dress up nice, have a fresh haircut. Brush your teeth. No matter what anybody says, looks matter. 

The second thing is mutual interest. Ask things. I used to have a list of subjects in my mind of things I could ask. Where were you born, what sports do you like, what job do you have, what is your favorite travel destination, do you have siblings. And follow up on the answers. Why did you move there? Do you practice those sports or do you enjoy watching them? What job do you want to do in the future? 

And if asked, give answer consisting of more than one word. Questions are asked to get conversations going and to start to know each other better. So tell about yourself. 

And search for mutual interests. It's easier to talk about subjects you share interest in."
96,What's the coolest thing that you have ever done in front of someone?,Absolutely smashing on a Marimba
97,What is a period of your life that you wish you could relive just one more time?,"September 10th, 2001. The final time my NY family was still fully together with an evening full of banter and laughter."

5 x suits
4 x dress pants
13 x dress shirts
5 x dress shoes 

I rarely use the suits, but really enjoy knowing they are there. Honestly, I am looking for excuses to wear them more. The other clothing items are for dates and some work events. Admittedly, you can be functional without that many items but I love clothes and fashion.

And I’m glad you didn’t ask about ties and dress socks."
99,What’s the last thing you did or learned that genuinely surprised you?,That Russia has started installing flare and chaff dispensers on their cruise missiles.
100,"Men of Reddit, what's the worst/most cruel case of bullying you've ever witnessed, been through or took part in?","In third grade my classmates though it would be funny to undress me and kick me out of the classroom, so they grabbed and undressed me, all while laughing, i didn't find it funny, had to run home naked."
101,"To my fellow builders and tinkerers out there, what kind of projects have you been working on lately?",I have to replace some rotten timbers on the back porch at mom's house. And I'm strongly considering buying an old Suzuki DR250 that's for sale near me and turning it into a retro su'mo.
102,What country are you from and what is the norm there for how men greet other men?,American high schooler I’ve seen people say hi hello hey howdy sup fuckers nice cock bro and a lot more a greetings
103,At what time in life were you most most confident/self loving and how did you get there?,"I would say I'm at that point now at 36yo, but it probably started around 31-32.  

Prior to this, especially around late 20s-turning 30, I was in the lowest point of my life.  For me, it wasn't until I started hanging out with my girlfriend now that I started to change.  She saw me in the hole I was in and she was the push and pull that helped me out of it.  I wanted to be better for her, so I started working on myself physically and mentally, but at some point, after making some minor improvements, I learned that I was getting better for me.   

I just started chipping away at little things to make a bigger change.  Biggest example is my physical health.  I slowly started eating better, drinking less (even quit drinking for a year), working out more, and once I saw how much better I looked and felt, I started feeling better about myself.  Mentally, I saw a therapist who helped me with my overthinking and anxiety and low self esteem and that was a long process, too, that I need to chip away at on my own.  There were a lot of other improvements I made in my life that got me to be the most confident/self loving person I am now, but it took time.  

The thing you have to understand is it takes time to do it, but if you want to make a change, start now."

106,How many of you are likers of champagne? Opinions?,"I love champagne/sparkling white wine. The price gets me for the ones I love. There’s a few $20-$25 bottles I like, but the ones I really love are $50-$75/bottle.

Wife and I often share a bottle of bubbly. Chandon is a go to because Costco sells it at $16/bottle here. But my favorite is Tattinger which can be $80/bottle"
107,under what conditions would you leave your partner for someone else,Leave them FOR someone else? I wouldn’t. I would only leave if there were irreconcilable differences that impacted the relationship in a negative way. But to leave her specifically to be with someone else? No.

He got there found a hotel in a red light district where he spent the next two weeks knee deep in multiple prostitutes at a time, booze and drugs. His food was delivered to his room and he got to live out the most hedonistic debaucherous lifestyle imaginable.

As the two weeks drew to a close he realized that he didn't hate life, he just hated the life he had been living. Eventually he left Thailand, found a job he didn't despise and got into therapy."

113,How do you respond to a guy who thinks they are better/more worthy than you?,Honestly those people aren’t worth my time.  This guy doesn’t sound like much of a friend.
114,"People who stalked someone you liked, how did you overcome your obsession ?","I grew up. You get older, you get less impressed by things. You give up on the concept of “the one”. You quit writing scripts for people in your head. There was nothing that really to overcome, I think I just waited for my prefrontal cortex to finish developing. 

Granted I don’t want to admit I was a full blown stalker, I think I was more of an orbiter, but man that level infatuation with unrequited love was torture and I’m glad to be rid of it."
115,What would you guys do if you had 1 million dollars in cash?,Legally or illegally? Cause that’s gas and groceries for the next 20 years if illegal
116,"Men who had a much lower libido than your girlfriends or wives, how did you strike a balance?",I stopped working so much and took days off so I can be less stressed. I would be too tired to even think about sex after work. I also started taking care of my health more to increase my sex drive.
117,What are your inner demons?,"People like to say you ""recover"" from addiction, but you don't. For an addict, it's not necessarily the substance itself, but the neural patterns that push you into that behaviour with the given substance being just what you prefer.

I'm an addict through and through, just right now I'm managing to keep it focused on lifting and silly hobbies, but the spectre of substance abuse always looms large and I can feel it creeping in a LOT of the time."
118,MOD ANNOUNCEMENT - r/AskMen and TikTok Trends - DON'T DO IT!,"Yes, this is about the ""whEn wAs tHe LaSt TiMe YoU tHoUgHt AbOuT tHe RoMan EmPirE?"" questions that have been getting asked pretty much a couple times a day lately. And we know you guys are sick of them as much as we are.

I mean ngl, you guys ask some of the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life, especially questions that boil down to ""just talk to them bro"" or ones that think men are mindreaders. But let's keep this shithole at least somewhat more palatable instead of the same dead meme."
119,Spouse/partner is going out of town for 2 weeks. What’s your go to plan for when they are gone?,"Not two weeks but recently happened when wife took kids to friends to visit.
I did this.
Dropped them off at airport.

Went to Costco and bought a chunk of pork and beef slightly smaller than a small airplane.

Grilled and drank while catching up on TV.

Got pretty deep into TOTK.

On days off loaded up my newly purchased old explorer with some camping gear, food and about 5000 rounds of ammo and disappeared into the expanse of eastern Arizona. 

Drove about 2000 total miles on dirt and only saw about 2 people. Slept under the stars and bathed in creaks (one day camped near a waterfall) 

Basically exactly what I did before I was married. But in Arizona and not Pennsylvania."

I find politics sacred. I wanted to run for public office. But it’s very simple why it didn’t work out for me. 

I’m just not a like-able person. I asked for signatures to put my name on the ballot and nobody would sign it. Not even my father. People in my town just hate me for whatever reason."
122,What opinion have you heard someone express to you that made you want to distance yourself from them?,"I made an acquaintance through the local pub, he would be there regularly with friends and so would I, we would end up mixing groups a lot. That is until he started to express how: “it’s scientifically proven that Chinese people are genetically closer to orangutans than white people” 

And

“I don’t hate other races but we are different breeds, like dogs, you wouldn’t mate a chihuahua with a Great Dane” 

After telling him he’s a cunt we definitely distanced ourselves"

131,What makes a first date great?,"I’m still in favor of the seriousness of the date’s escalating as you go on more. 

1st date should be casual and honestly it’s allowed to be awkward and short. Verify what each other looks like, you speak the same language, and no one showed up wearing skin that wasn’t theirs. Date 1 exists to justify date 2.

Date 2 is where the romance and intimacy gets turned on. Bring little gifts like flowers. Spend a day together, pick each others brains, smile, laugh, touch each other and maybe kiss. 

Date 3. Repeat date two concept, but mutual attraction needs to be openly verified. If it’s there, the intimacy and personal discussions only increase from there. At this point sex is on the table for the near future."

152,Men with anxious attachment proclivities..how do you build a strong healthy relationship?,"Ignore the nay  sayers. You do, you just work hard at building a strong self esteem and talk yourself through the negative thoughts. If it gets really bad, you can confide in your partner, but be strong!! This can lead to always needing reassurance and it can drain a person and make them feel very disrespected. They won't see it as ""I'm afraid and don't know why i feel this way"" but ""you can't be trusted until you prove it to me"". When in doubt ask yourself ""has this person given me a reason not to trust them?"" It's unfortunate to say but you will never really escape the fears in my experience, you will only learn to make them smaller."
153,"Men who have dated single moms and it was successful, what was / is the relationship like?","Don’t expect him to become a father to your kids. Make this clear to him from the first date. Your relationship with him should be about your relationship with him, not about his relationship with your kids. This doesn’t mean how he is with your kids or how your kids feel about him isn’t important.

Don’t get overly excited about the idea of some fantasy future in which him, your kids, and you live happily ever after doing idyllic family stuff together. This can put a LOT of pressure on a guy and can come across as very needy. 

He should not be someone your family NEEDS. He should be someone YOU (an individual) WANTS. 

Be compassionate and understanding about his needs and his (lack of) obligation to your family unit. 

Do your best to support him and be compassionate in all of his interactions with your ex(es)."

I went into debt for University but paid it off pretty aggressively once I graduated. Took a few years. Paid for my post-grad through grants and savings.

I've had a few car loans over the years as well but those I paid off on time. 

I have pretty good credit from not missing any payments, keeping my credit utilization low, and my debt-income ratio in check. It's nice not having debt repayments to make on stuff that isn't providing me value any longer."

173,"Men of Reddit, as far as you know, how can you differentiate a woman’s real orgasm from a fake one?","When it’s real she’s usually too busy having an orgasm to worry about looking sexy while it happens. Ie weird facial expressions, odd noises, weird motions, shaking, etc. If it’s fake she’s probably still looking hot while “orgasming” bc at that point she’s putting on a performance."
174,What redline did you think you would never cross but ultimately did?,"Sleeping with a married woman. Never thought I would cross that line. And I definitely tried to resist. But one thing I can say is that when a woman wants you she will pull out some 5D chess moves on you lol. I think the karma for me is that I for real caught feelings for her, and she tossed my ass to the side like nothing when she was done. Had to pick my face up off the floor. 

Serves me right for crossing that line."

180,"Men of Reddit, what is your go-to subreddit for entertainment?",r/puppies
181,How do you actively work on improving your personality? Share your best tips!,"I took feedback that I kept receiving: I always made stuff about myself. 
In my mind, I was just looking for a way to relate to people, but it came off bad. 
If someone told me they were heartbroken over someone, I’d immediately tell them about a time I’d been heartbroken. 
I made the conscious decision to stop telling my story whenever someone told something, and instead of interjecting my own experience, I’d ask a question. 
Are you alright? 
How long ago was this?
If someone was telling me about going to London, rather than yak about my own trip, I’d ask:
What was your favorite part of London?
Did you travel alone?
Anything really.  
I think you have to consciously make genuine effort not to be liked, but to be a better person."
182,What role do you play at family gatherings?,"The guy people ask about because I am not there.

Half my siblings don't talk to the other half. My mom only talks to half.

I've been the peacemaker and go between since I was a teenager. I'm 30 now and outside of a few random memes to try and force a sibling GC conversation every few months (it never works) I'm sick of it."
183,What does it say about men who pursue married women?,"I'm not proud of it, but I used to fuck around a bit when I was younger and dumber so I'll add what I learned, just for perspective: 

It's basically an airtight guarantee that adulterers aren't gonna do any of the annoying shit an unattached partner does like bother you at weird hours or blow up your phone while you're at work or show up at your place unexpected or even talk about you with other people, honestly they rarely even text. This is because 1) they're busy and 2) it's in **their** best interest to keep you a secret, keep you at arm's length, and keep things extremely casual. They kinda have to, they have a LOT more on the line than you do. 

Married women (and, I assume, married men) are perfect FWBs: ultra discreet by default, and no strings attached because all their strings are already all tied up. Nevermind texting back promptly, you're literally not allowed to text them at all, ever. And they can't get mad at you for sleeping with other people.

None of these things were the appeal back in my reckless ho era -- nice legs were the appeal -- but all of these things became apparent to me after the fact. If you can manage to push any and all morality aside (which is frighteningly easy to do as an extremely horny young man) dating married women was way less stress/pressure/whatever than trying to maintain regular casual sex with an unattached partner. No matter how cool you try to be about it, it gets complicated. Married people, on the other hand, quite literally require it to be uncomplicated. 

Judge if you will, but for clarity I'd also like to add that in every one of the instances I experienced, it was the married woman who initially showed interest in me, not the other way around."
184,What's the male equivalent of trimming your hair whenever you are going through a bad phase?,Building muscle.
185,What do fellow walkers use to not smell like shit?,"I live in the tropics so I’m in a similar situation.

I trim my body hair every couple of months, wear deodorant daily (Gillette Clear Gel is my favorite) and shower twice a day. 

It’s enough for me, I commute around 1.5km everyday and don’t tend to sweat or smell."
186,What is your favorite hobby or activity to unwind?,Hanging out with my daughters is my favorite. Just being in the same room with them is all I need.
187,What do you wish your father taught you?,Anything.
188,What is your favorite band and why do you listen to them?,"Iron Maiden.

I always thought they are overrated. When I was going through a breakup, I used to play them in the background when playing League of Legends with a couple of my friends. I eventually got used to their melodies and Bruce's voice became so calming and the fact I was playing with my friends kept me distracted at the time, all of this made the band so comforting to me. For like a year and a half, I wouldn't listen to anything else at all and now, another year later, I still listen to them the most"
189,How many times a week do you hang out with friends?,"At most twice a week, sometimes I'll easily go a month without seeing anyone apart from my partner, family and coworkers though"

I don't really care if we even hit it off, we just never even tried. That's always the worst part. I'd rather fail at things in life than never try."
194,"Im worried about men’s mental health. Men, who do you confide in 100%?","No one.
Not even close to a 100%."
195,"Those of you who have lost your father's, how did it affect you? Also how old were you when you lost him?","I lost my dad in May 2017. I was 36 years old and my daughter was born just over a month earlier. We were never close when I was young, we had only learned a few years prior that we genuinely liked each other, and we had just begun working through all the baggage from everything involved with my tumultuous childhood.  He was learning to deal with and healthily relate his emotions, and I was learning to process the trauma of my past mistakes and the mistreatment I had suffered at the hands of my mother. 

In a fairly short time, he had become one of my best friends. Our bond went beyond that of son and father, weirdly due to the divorces we were going through at the same time.

And he's not here anymore. There's so much I never got the chance to tell him, so much we never got to do together, and so many things I still feel like I need to make up for with him.

On the opposite end, though, his death was the catalyst to my getting my life in order. I needed to do right by him, to make sure no one could think that he failed. I've lost weight, worked hard at my job, bought a house and cars, and even started taking college courses, and I would never have done any of those things had he not passed.

But, fuck... I miss him so much..."
