1,Askscience is featured in: PARKS! Part 4: Would flooding Death Valley offset sea level rise?,"Dean: Basically, he's saying that Death Valley isn't a rectangular box. But if it was, it would only be 355 square miles that are 70 feet deep, not 200-plus feet deep.

Ben: It's still pretty deep. But how much water would that hold?

Chris: About 4.5 cubic miles of water.

Amory: Not the amount of water that we probably needed to hold.

Chris: This would counter about a week of sea level rise."

3,Why are there volcanoes on Hawaii? It's nowhere near any fault lines.,"My comment may get removed since I don't know what I'm talking about, but my Google-fu brought up this:

Hot-spot volcanism - Volcanoes can also form above a column of superheated magma called a mantle plume. This may happen in areas that are distant from plate boundaries. It is also referred to as hot spot or intraplate volcanism.

Source: https://www.bgs.ac.uk/discovering-geology/earth-hazards/volcanoes/how-volcanoes-form-2/#:~:text=Hot%2Dspot%20volcanism,hot%20spot%20or%20intraplate%20volcanism."
4,Why is the suction limit 32 ft. And is it related to the 32 ft/s² ?,"Because you're not really sucking anything up anything. The outside pressure is *pushing* it from the outside. 

At sea level, 32/33 feet is as high as the atmosphere can push water up into a vacuum. Doesn't matter how thin or thick the space is, either."
5,How is location/orientation specified in space?,"You will often see a reference to 'sidereal' in astronomy. This means by reference to the 'fixed stars', the stars that are apparently stationary from our position. 

This can be used to orient yourself on a scale large enough to determine orbital angles for planets. 

Ultimately all reference systems are arbitrary and are going to be based on what you're measuring.

6,Why do bugs bite us?,"By ""bugs,"" I'll assume you mean any creepy  crawley and not just the group of insect called ""bugs""

One of 3 reasons.
1) Nutritional. They survive off blood. Bed Bugs, fleas, horse flies etc all live off blood so they're biting you is a form of predation/parisitism.
2) They are scared and perceive you as a threat needing to defend themselves from. Black Widows are highly skittish and will only bite if cornered or pressed on. And this applies to a great many bugs.
3) Aggressively protecting their territory, nest or personal space. Ants and Bees will suicidally protect their nest if disturbed. Centipedes will act like the local tough guy screaming, ""You wanna piece of me!?"" if threatened."
7,Feynman's Explanation of Light Travelling in a Straight line in QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter doesn't seem to make sense to me?,"One issue here is that experimentally we can't actually tell the path that a light particle travels, only where the particle starts and where it ends. Logically speaking though, for a light particle to travel the direct path, it must travel the same minimum distance as all other particles to reach the other side. This means that there's no room for the particle to travel more and become out of phase, so all the particles that follow the direct path must be constructively interfering with each other. As we consider particles that deviate more and more from this path, the more opportunities that the particles destructively interfere and hit the other side out of phase, though these non-direct particles can still arrive in phase with the direct route particles.

For your last question, I think you're partially dancing around the idea of light diffraction. There are other points that result in constructive interference that aren't the direct path of light. You can see this in single slit diffraction experiments."
8,"Why did all the other hominids die out, while Homosapiens are so successful? What explains this stark contrast?","In the big picture, I'd put this down to something called the [competitive exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle).  Basically, it's difficult to for species to coexist in the same niche in the same place.  If one species is a better competitor than the other, it will tend to push the other out.  There are exceptions to this rule, for a variety of reasons, but none seem to particularly apply to humans.  

Hominids have broad, overlapping niches, so it makes sense they would compete.  Often, species will divide up based on terrain.  You'll have related species that live in different parts of the world. But modern humans are extremely good at dispersing and moved into all the areas that other hominid species occupied, getting rid of this location-based partition of species.

I think this explains why it's not surprising that you would have one surviving species of hominid.  Given a bunch of related, directly competing species that all have overlapping ranges, it's reasonable that only one should come out on top.  And that could happen even if that one species were only slightly better at competing than the others.  Small advantages add up over time.  

Now the exact details of why humans specifically won out and exactly how they won out are murky  (despite being a very interesting question).  We don't have as much detail as we'd like about the behavior of various other hominid species.  There's a ton of speculation but I wouldn't say any of it is conclusive.  Also, when I talk about modern humans ""outcompeting"" other species, that's a very broad term.  It could mean anything from direct physical hostility to simply getting at the food more efficiently.  

We can, however, say that while there _was_ some level of interbreeding between different species, humans don't seem to have simply crossbred with other species until they disappeared.  The amount of nonhuman DNA in modern humans is low enough that it suggests that successful crosses were fairly rare."

10,Is Grass blade a Single Organism?,"https://forages.oregonstate.edu/regrowth/how-does-grass-grow/grass-structures

Usually several leaves are part of the same plant. There’s a central stem, and some leaves, and it can propagate itself underground to a new spot. The article linked above has a good illustration and gets really deep into it."
11,Why can't the Panama Canal be an open water way?,[removed]
12,Why does the hydrogen nuclei split in different states when exposed to an external magnetic field?,"The hydrogen nucleus doesn't split, it's a single proton (in fact any nucleus with odd proton number or odd nucleon number has a non-zero nuclear spin). The fact that it has non-zero nuclear spin means it interacts with an external magnetic field, and can either have its spin aligned with or against it. These two different states are not the same, energetically, and a photon of the right energy can bump a proton from the low energy state (""alpha"") to the high energy state (""beta"") by flipping its spin direction. A nucleus in the high energy state will, after some time, drop down into the low energy state by emitting a photon. The difference in energy between the two states is known as the splitting. The reason why this is useful for working out molecular composition is that this energy splitting is altered slightly be the chemical environment, i.e. electron density, that the proton finds itself in. Thus by very precisely measuring the peaks in absorption frequency (not really a resonant frequency of the molecule, rather each hydrogen nucleus), you can learn a lot about the different environments the hydrogen atoms in your molecule find themselves in."
13,Is the visible universe shrinking as the expansion of space speeds up?,"It depends on what you consider.

The distance to the farthest matter where we can see some of its light? This distance (currently 46 billion light years) will increase approximately exponentially.

The present or future distance to the farthest matter where the light it emits at a given date can still reach us? Equivalently, the farthest matter we can still reach. This distance will increase slowly to around 16 billion light years.

The *present* distance for the same? This distance is shrinking if we consider a later point in time. In other words, we can see more galaxies in their state 14 billion years after than the Big Bang than we'll see galaxies as they'll be 15 billion years after the Big Bang."
14,"Ask Anything Wednesday - Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science","Is there a reason or theory as to why Earth, Mars, Saturn, and Neptune all have a very similar axial tilt (23°-28°) or is it just a coincidence?"
15,How do you write the scientific name of animals with unknown hybrid ancestry?,"When it comes to naming animals with unknown hybrid ancestry, there isn't a specific standardized convention. As far as I'm aware of, use the genus name followed by the species name: In cases where the hybrid ancestry is unknown, you can still use the genus name followed by the species name to indicate the closest known relatives. For example, if the hybrid fish is a cross between Xiphophorus maculatus and X. variatus, you could refer to it as Xiphophorus sp. (where ""sp."" stands for ""species"") or Xiphophorus hybrid. This indicates that it belongs to the genus Xiphophorus but doesn't specify the exact species."
16,What is the average social/physical lifespan of a cemetery?,"Depends on the country.

The United States is only a few hundred years old, so I wouldn't expect to find any graveyards that predate that unless you're talking about ancient native burial sites.

In older European countries I wouldn't be surprised to find grave markers dating back to a thousand years ago. It really just depends on the culture and history of an area."
17,Burning plastic is often associated with “being toxic.” What exactly is toxic about it?,"All kinds of chemicals, including cyanide & such.  Nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and polycyclic organic matter (POMs). Burning plastic and treated wood also releases heavy metals and toxic chemicals, such as dioxin, mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls."
18,Are allergy pollen count forecasts accurate/useful?,"I actually study bio-particles in respect to air quality, so I’m happy to give you some context and answer any questions you have. 

First, how far apart are these conflicting sites? The differences you’re seeing reported could be due to the local density of ragweed in one region compared to another. The highest concentrations of pollen will be near the source. Wind patterns and convection will lead to more spread of the pollen.  Ragweed does enjoy travelling though so on windy days it could be anywhere!

If the sites are close together and not agreeing then they might not all be actively counted, but are modelled.  Look up their method for reporting pollen levels, if they’re actively counting pollen in air samples from the location then those results are accurate.  

Pollen does vary quite a lot day to day. A tip for you: morning time is the best for avoiding pollen levels. Plus you’ll avoid traffic related pollution too, which has synergistic effects on pollen allergies."
19,How does smell work on a molecular level?,"Up until *very recently*, I think your chemistry teacher would have been correct. However, in March of 2023, we got [our first look at an odor molecule bonding with an odor receptor](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00439-w), at the molecular level...so now, at least for *this one odor*, we know how smell works.

The researchers created a 3d image of the [OR51E2 receptor bonding with propionate](https://analyticalscience.wiley.com/do/10.1002/was.0002057017/), which contributes to the smell of Swiss cheese. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they were able to see the propionate bonding tightly with the receptor. 

This bonding was consistent with [the docking theory of olfaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_theory_of_olfaction), the leading smell hypothesis since the '50s, which proposed that odor molecules have distinct shapes which would uniquely fit into matching shaped receptors in the nose. And that is exactly what researchers saw: propionate molecules fit snugly within the OR51E2 receptor, and the act of ""docking"" caused a physical shape change in the receptor...which signals the cell to signal the nerve to signal the brain.

While it's unlikely that every smell receptor couples as tightly as propionate and OR51E2, at least now researchers have a tool they can use to begin documenting other physical interactions between odor ligands and their matching receptors."
20,Why are the extinction events in the Cambrian not considered mass extinctions?,"> There's a graph on Wikipedia (you can view it if you just type in ""extinction event"") that shows the extinction rate of marine genera over the last 550 million years or so, beginning at the Cambrian.

Always helpful to actually link to what you're talking about, i.e., [this graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Extinction_intensity.svg) that pairs with a [list of extinction events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinction_events).

>Do these extinctions have names

Yes, they are usually referred to as the [Botomian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-Botomian_mass_extinction) and [Dresbachian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresbachian) events (and they appear in the list of extinction events linked above as such).

> why aren't they counted as the major mass extinctions that they are?

They are considered mass extinctions and regularly discussed as such, e.g., they are included in lists of mass extinctions like Table 1 of [Bond & Grasby, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216306915). Presumably more what you're asking is why are they not either (1) considered part of the ""big 5"" (or maybe why isn't the ""big 5"" instead the ""big 7"" including them) or (2) why do they not represent the end of a geologic period (like the end Permian or end Cretaceous extinctions, etc.)?

The answer to these two questions reflect a couple of different things. One aspect (that is touched on in the short wiki entries for both of these events), is that the fossil record for these periods is pretty spotty so we simply don't know that much about these events compared to many others in terms of exact timing, potential causes, geographic distribution of the event, and more solid numbers on the percentages of genera that went extinct. Another important aspect is that the [geologic timescale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale), including the way it is structured and what divisions get which relative rank (i.e., is something the boundary between an era, eon, period, epoch, and so on) reflect kind of a weird mix of history (in the sense of past work) and lots of more modern work. What this means is that sometimes, major events that were recognized after the establishment of the geologic timescales basic structure might end up not being a major division in the timescale. While there is a lot of effort to better establish the absolute ages of the various boundaries using radiometric dating, there is a general resistance to wholesale change the divisions (in terms of say elevating something like an epoch boundary to a period boundary) because it makes dealing with previous work a real pain.

The two issues described above are also related in that given the relative lack of details known about these two extinction events (and especially their imprecise timing), *they don't make good major divisions for the geologic timescale*. What makes the timescale useful in part is that the hierarchy of divisions reflect (in a simple way) both the actual scale of changes that occur across that boundary, but also critically how easily it is *globally* recognize those changes within the geologic record (and where at the ""lesser"" parts of the timescales divisions like stages, end up being regional so it's pretty common to have different stages for different continents)."
21,Dose the increase of average global temperature cause the oceans to evaporate more?,"Yes. A liquid and a gas in equilibrium would be exchanging molecules of the liquid substance and the amount of molecules in the gas (a.k.a. the vapor) would increase exponentially with the temperature.

As the planet gets hotter, more water would be in the atmosphere causing continental masses to be drier in summers and coast regions to be more humid and rainy. Also hurricanes might become either bigger or more frequent, as the strength of a hurricane or typhoon is directly proportional to the amount of water that is evaporated right below it.

Please remember that everything about climate is probabilistic, so there would be local exceptions but an undeniable overall trend"
22,Why does detergent powder become hot in your hands?,"Some substances require energy to dissolve, such as urea. It makes the water icy cold as it dissolves in, ""using up"" the water's heat.

Other substances release energy when they dissolve, such as sodium hydroxide (lye). Dissolving sodium hydroxide in water makes the water heat up and can even make it start boiling if you add too much. 

The detergent powder has something like that 2nd case in it, which is releasing / generating heat as it dissolves in the water in your hands.

Search ""exothermic dissolving"" for more info."
23,Why are we not being constantly scalded?,"Same reason why you can flick your finger through a flame and not get scalded. Heat is just the jiggling of atoms. If part of your finger gets hit with an atom of high internal energy, the energy is quickly transferred to nearby atoms in your skin. It becomes a problem when too many high energy atoms hit an area of your skin. The energy can’t spread out to nearby atoms fast enough and reaches a point where it causes ~~atomic~~  chemical bonds to break down and your skin experiences burn trauma."
24,Is there an equivalent or similar number system that uses the logathrim as its extension rather than the sqrt?,"The natural log of -1 is i*pi, so in a sense it already is the same (gives you the imaginary, and by extension the complex numbers). If you want to get a little more precise, you could use the quantity e^pi for the base, approximately 23.14. The log with that base of -1 is precisely i."
25,How do young members of pack predators know they're old enough to join on a hunt?,"Many pack animals have a 'stay at home' phase and then a 'stay with the pack' phase. When they begin to stay with the pack if ambush is needed instinct or prior play/practice will keep them down, they may attempt to join in on the chase but chances are they will just fall behind harmlessly while they are young. As they get older, stronger, faster they stay in the chase longer and progressively learn to chase, then to attack, and finally to kill."
26,"How does a rock become effectively extinct, and unable to be mined?","So this is a question that would probably do well with a crossover with another sub, like /r/AskHistorians or maybe /r/ArtHistory. So with the caveat that I'm neither a historian or art historian, we can tackle the geological side of this question. Where a historian / art historian would be especially helpful would be providing some background on exactly what qualifies as a *species* of marble in this context. As a term, species (in a non biologic sense) definitely comes up in geology, usually in the context of describing a *mineral species*, i.e., a broad category of mineral (e.g., quartz) that will have a suite of varieties (e.g., amethyst, citrine, etc.). It's not as common (in geology at least) to discuss *species* of rocks, or at least, it's a term that does not have a clear definition in this context (which is a problem for answering the question). 

What I'm going to assume here is that *species of marble* in this context refers to a portion of a marble deposit with a very specific set of criteria, including color, patterning (e.g., from veins or [stylolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylolite)), texture, and other mechanical properties (e.g., how exactly it tends to fracture, how workable it is either in a mining or sculpture sense) etc. All of these details will reflect some mixture of (1) the composition and primary structures within the [protolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protolith), (2) the metamorphic conditions, i.e., the pressure temperature conditions and their duration, that transformed the original limestone or dolomite into a [marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marble) (assuming in fact the *species* in question is actually a marble, more on that in a second), and (3) any post metamorphic history that modified the rock volume in question (e.g., the formation of stylolites). Even if we just focus on the protolith, there can be *a lot* of variety because of primary depositional variations, i.e., the type of environment in which a limestone forms can impart a lot of [heterogeneity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone#Description) between, and even within, deposits, which will impart differences in a marble after metamorphosis. It's also worth mentioning, that outside a geologic context, the term marble gets used for rocks that are not actually marbles in geologic sense (sort of how any rock used for a countertop is referred to as a granite, even if it's not geologically a granite). For example, the deposit referred to as the [Red Verona Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Verona_marble) is not actually a marble, it's a limestone.

**The summary** from above is that the unique intersection of original material and geologic history means that you can end up with a lot of variety in marbles (or really, any rock). If a particular body of marble is prized for the very specific set of characteristics (which we assume constitute a *species*), then there will be a finite amount of that marble reflecting those unique conditions. Depending on how specific we get with those characteristics, there may be no other marble deposit on Earth with those exact characteristics, so we can consider that after we've mined out all of that deposit, that *species* of marble is *extinct*, in the sense that there is nowhere else we can find a marble with those exact characteristics. In the broadest sense, while we classify rocks by type (e.g., marble, granite, etc.) most any particular deposit/body of rock will be somewhat unique in some way (and a huge amount of geology centers on understanding the processes that result in, and significance of those, differences)."
27,Why is 12pm always during daylight hours?,"This is because there are two different definitions of a day, but normally we only call them a ""day"" instead of their full names, a [Synodic Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_day) and a [Sidereal Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time). 

A Synodic Day is 24 hours long. A Sidereal Day is 23 hours and 56 minutes long. What are these days? A Sidereal Day is how long it takes the Earth to rotate 360 degrees- make a full rotation. Notice this is a little less than 24 hours, what we think of as a ""day."" That's because a Synodic Day is how long it takes the Earth (well, any planet really) to complete a full rotation with respect to the star it is orbiting. That is, how long it takes until the same part of the planet is facing the star again. Since the Earth is orbiting in the same rotational direction as it is rotating, it has to rotate a little more than 360 degrees until the same part of the Earth is facing the Sun again. 

So you are correct, if we said a day was 23 hours and 56 minutes (how long it takes Earth to rotate 360 degrees), then the 12 noon would switch from being mid-day to mid-night as we orbited the Sun. But since we use the Synodic day as our ""day length"" it stays in sync."
28,Is there a point on Mercury that has higher local temperatures than on Venus?,"Because of its lack of atmosphere, the dark side of Mercury is really cold, about -200°C while the side facing the Sun reaches around 430°C.

Venus has average temperatures more like 470°C so its greenhouse effect is that powerful. Venus has minimum temperatures of around 430°C, comparable to Mercury's maximum."
29,Is the temperature in a vacuum cleaner 20% lower if the pressure is 20% lower?,"There are a few points you‘re missing:

1. Ideal gas law assumes thermodynamic equilibrium, but there is always going to be heat exchange (see point 2) and matter exchange (see point 3), so equilibrium cannot really be achieved inside the vacuum cleaner.

2. There is a motor running which heats up. Also, the vacuum cleaner isn‘t thermally insulated, so there is going to be heat exchange with the air outside of it.

3. The air that a vacuum cleaner sucks in doesn‘t stay in there but gets exhausted again after the dust and dirt have been filtered out. The air never settles, it is always moving."
30,"If a person who weighs 150 lbs eats 1lb of food and immediately steps on a scale, would they weigh 101lb, even if only briefly?","Yes, 151 pounds.  Imagine you walked on the scale and it said 150.  Then you picked up 1lb of marshmallows and held them as you walked on the scale.  It would definitely be 151.  If you then kept standing on the scale and shoved the entire pound of fluffy mallows down your throat, the scale would not drop to 150 because the delicious sugary marshed-mallows were eaten."
31,what is the bird that lays most eggs per year?,"Over a year No, it's selective breeding trait which has forced this trait/behaviour into the animal for consistently laying unfertilised eggs.

Though if you're talking about a shorter space of time they are easily beaten by birds with larger clutches, wild ostriches will lay 12-20 wggs in a clutch laying to 1 egg per day. then in reptiles you have pythons which can lay 20+ eggs in a day"
32,How exactly are bombs defused?,"Not an expert, but I was a combat engineer during my armed service. Your question is very broad, since there is an astounding variety of explosives. Very often (like with a non-rigged land mine) you just take the detonator off. Devices designed to last a long time can't afford to have actual electronics in most cases.

Demo charges for like clearing cliffs to build a road? Generally an electric wire is used there. Just cut the wire, there is no active current running through it. If you are near the explosive, you can probably just yank off the wire too. Due to the usage its not like they're designed to withstand sabotage.

Additionally, while not quite defusing, controlled explosions are a thing. Like smaller anti-personel mines can simply be shot from a safe distance. It's pretty cool, not gonna lie."
33,I read that we haven't had this much CO2 in the atmosphere since 5 million years ago. How much higher was the sea level back then?,"[Figure 1 from Miller et al., 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aaz1346) includes a paired record of global sea level and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere for the Cenozoic (i.e., for the last 65 million years). For the sea level curve, what looks like a lot of scatter is really more just fluctuations on shorter time intervals driven by [Milankovitch forcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles), but there is definitely uncertainty in these estimates. For the CO2 curve, there is a good amount of scatter reflecting differing sensitivity and uncertainties in the different proxy data used to construct the record. If we focus on the smoothed sea level curve in panel D and whats amounts to a smoothed CO2 curve in E (the red fuzzy line), we can see that we have to go back to about 20 million years before CO2 concentrations were solidly higher than today (i.e., > 400 ppm). At that time, sea level was broadly higher, ranging from just a bit above modern to 10s of meters above modern, but with a fair amount of variability. As an aside, if you want to see a much longer record of CO2, you can check out [Figure 4](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845/figures/4) from [Foster et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14845), but they don't display a sea level curve, so you'd have to sort of eyeball it with a similar length of sea level record, like [Figure 1 from Miller et al., 2005](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1116412).

At geologic timescales like these, it's also important to remember atmospheric temperature (and ice volume) are not the only drivers of sea level. For example, changes in mid-ocean spreading rates and thus the size of ocean basins can play large roles (e.g., [Müller et al., 2008](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1151540)), which is why for example, sea level was *extemely* high during the Cretaceous (with sea levels upwards of 100-200 meters above modern), in part reflecting *very fast* mid-ocean ridge spreading rates (and thus broadly shallower ocean basins). There are other controls on sea level as well (Figure 1 from Miller et al., 2005 is actually a nice schematic of the controls in the sense of their possible amplitudes and timescales), and all of this to say is that we *do not* expect a 1:1 correspondence between CO2 and sea level, so that's the relationship in Miller et al., 2020 is messy, is not really surprising."
34,Do fish need water to swallow?,"Most fish need water to get food in their mouth in the first place.  Most fish capture food by opening the mouth and enlarging the mouth cavity, which creates a current that draws in food.  Even when fish do bite and grasp prey with their mouth, they often use this method to move the prey fully into their mouths.

However, once the prey is down in the throat, a combination of muscle contractions and throat-jaws (and teeth) usually do most of the moving of the food during swallowing."
35,How do tree nut allergies work?,"*Tree nut* is one of the 8 common allergens.

There are six main tree nuts that all get lumped into together.  If someone is allergic to one, 50% chance they are allergic to the rest.  That is walnut, almond, hazelnut, pecan, cashew and pistachio.  For instance, cashew+pistachio and walnut+pecan tend to cross-trigger.

Coconut is not a tree nut.  It's a fruit.  For tax purposes it gets treated as a nut.  The vast majority of tree-nut sensitive individuals can tolerate a coconut YMMV.

Biggest real risk is *cross contamination*.  Those nuts ripen at different times of the year.  So my walnut factory is closed for the season, better re-open it to process all those pistachios coming in. Hence the reason your food packaging has the statement ""this product was manufactured in a facility that also processes dairy"".

Protein is what you are reacting to.  For instance, almonds have 6 different proteins that are known to trigger an immune response.

The main allergen molecule in almonds is named *[2S albumin storage protein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570561/)*.  That is one method the plant uses to store energy for later.  The same protein is also found in walnuts, sunflower seeds and peanuts.

Car analogy!  Maybe you are allergic to a mid-size SUV such as a Subaru.  A Toyota mid-size SUV looks close enough on the outside that you are also allergic to that one too.  Luckily, Toyota also makes econoboxes, sports cars, luxury cars, utility vehicles, etc, and you aren't allergic to those.

Much like you share a lot of DNA with primates, plants also share a lot of DNA with each other.  There are only so many methods to store nutrition for later.

[The 2S albumin storage protein is very inhomogenous](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8228421/) across different plant families.  The ""bones"" are very similar across species, but the decorations on top are very different.  

A senisitized person may be sensitive to that skeleton structure, so typical cross-sensitivity for all tree nuts.

Or, a sensitized person may be insensitive to the skeleton structure but sensitive to some specific arrangement of decorations on top.  The more unique cross-sensitivity to evolutionary distant plant families (e.g. almonds and sunflowers)."
36,What causes an insect to die of old age?,[removed]
37,Question from my 8 year old: Can insects die of old age?,"Some species of insect have evolved to die as soon as they've reproduced e.g. many crane fly species don't have mouths in their adult form so they'll just lay their eggs and keel over dead once they've used up their stores of energy.

38,"If humans originated and then migrated from Africa, did all other primates do so as well?","There's a couple of ways to interpret your question here.

Did the basal ancestor of all primates evolve in Africa?  The ultimate answer to that is ""we don't know.""  The other response goes into good depth on that.

Are there groups/species of primates that didn't exist in Africa, but evolved outside of Africa?  Yes, definitely.  As an example, the ancestors of the extant New World Monkeys (the Platyrrhini) made their way across the ocean to the New World during the Eocene (approx 56-34 mya.)  Later, the Platyrrhini split into a number of different Families, five of which are still extant.  For example the most recent common ancestor of all the tamarins and marmosets was somewhere around 20-14 mya.  So tamarins and marmosets never existed in Africa and evolved in their current geographical place.  Same for the capuchins, howler monkeys, douroucouli, and the uakari-titi-saki clade.

39,How do dangerous bacteria survive gastric acids?,"Stomach acid creates an environment (low pH) that accelerates digestion by protonating molecules of the food you ingest, which helps them react with water in a way that breaks them into smaller pieces. Even then, however, these reactions would be too slow for any meaningful digestion to take place, so the acidity also activates digestive enzymes, which greatly accelerate the reactions. It’s the action of these enzymes that would be lethal to bacteria in the stomach rather than the acid itself, and least in the short term.

Bacteria can temporarily survive this environment by having sugar, lipid, and protein structures on their surface that are resistant to rapid digestion by these enzymes. They can also have an increased chance of survival if they were inside a piece of food that didn’t (or couldn’t) get broken down entirely before it moved on to the intestine. It can also sometimes be a numbers game, where enough were ingested that even though 99.9% were destroyed, enough made it through to cause infection.

Another thing to keep in mind is that many bacteria can survive passing through the stomach, but not all cause disease. Many just don’t have the necessary virulence factors to cause an infection afterward. We notice bacteria like Salmonella and Listeria because they are equipped with what are essentially weapons that activate once they’ve made it through the stomach."

41,How to understand notation in thermodynamics?,">There are other ways to write this formula/law. One of them is dU = δQ - δW, which I don't understand. The ""δ""s in front of ""Q"" and ""W"" makes sense, since we are referring to infinitesimally small transitions of energy, as heat and work. But why the ""d"" in front of ""U""? This ""d"" has nothing to do with differentiation, so why not use ""δ"" here as well? 

They're both changes in energy, but heat and work are inexact differentials, while the change in internal energy is an exact differential. [Previous thread about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/521vz8/what_is_the_difference_between_heat_q_and/).

>Lastly, I've seen people use the term ΔQ in other equations in thermodynamics. Since ""Q"" is already a change of something (correct me if I'm wrong), what's the point of the ""Δ""? 

These are just notational differences, and you're right that heat, no matter how it's written down, is fundamentally a **change** in energy. To say that something ""*has* 5 Joules of heat"" doesn't mean anything; it only makes sense to say ""5 Joules of heat were *transferred* from one system to another"". Chemists, physicists, engineers, etc. decide to write that differently in equations, but they all mean the same thing. (Or if they mean something different, they're wrong.)

>They used it to reffer to ""change in the heat of the system"". I thought heat wasn't a property a system has.

You are correct, and that quote is wrong at face value. People often misspeak, or say it wrong, but speaking precisely, you're right. Heat cannot be ""had"", it can only be transferred."
42,Why can't hurricanes like Lee maintain it's cat 5 rating for extended periods?,"A category 5 hurricane is a heat engine hitting on all cylinders. Most any environmental disruption will lead to a throttling down of that engine. Among the disruptions possible out over the open ocean are:

  * Passage over cooler water
  * Upwelling of cooler water (beneath a slow moving storm)
  * Increased zonal wind shear
  * Entrainment of mid-level dry air
  * Eyewall replacement cycles^(1)


In the case of Lee, the hurricane began to encounter both moderate to strong wind shear and some dry air entrainment about 12 hours after its explosive growth to Category 5 on Thursday.  The wind shear regime has now been present for 36 hours during which Lee has weakened to Cat 3.

^1. An eyewall replacement cycle is a natural process by which an intense storm's eyewall contracts and some of the outer rainbands strengthen and organize into a ring of thunderstorms.  This new, outer eyewall slowly moves inward, starving the original, inner eyewall of needed moisture and angular momentum, weakening the storm.  After 12-24 hours, the outer eyewall may replace the inner one completely, and the storm may re-intensify."
43,Why do ice cubes stick to the side of the glass?,"It is due to the adhesion and cohesion of water. Water is sticky.

[https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/adhesion-and-cohesion-water](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/adhesion-and-cohesion-water)

Water usually prefers to touch more water or another solid than to touch air. This causes the water to form a meniscus anytime an ice cube gets anywhere near the side of the glass.

[https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/water-meniscus#:\~:text=What%20is%20a%20meniscus%3F,the%20inside%20of%20a%20glass](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/water-meniscus#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20meniscus%3F,the%20inside%20of%20a%20glass).

The meniscus wants to decrease the area it has exposed to the air, and it can do this by pulling the ice closer to the glass. This effect puts a small attractive force between the ice and the glass.

It also worth noting that anytime there are temperature differences in a liquid (and gravity), there will be movement in the liquid due to natural convection."
44,Kilograms measure mass and pounds measure weight: what does NASA use to talk about weight on the moon?,"This largely becomes a formal terminology/units thing vs the way we use words/units colloquially thing. Specifically, both [kilograms (kg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram) and [pounds (lb)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_%28mass%29) are units of mass, where 1 lb = 0.45359237 kg. More correctly, we should refer to a ""pound"" (as a unit of mass) as ""pound-mass"" to differentiate it from [pound-force (lbf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_%28force%29), i.e., mass x acceleration, but usually we just shorten ""pound-mass"" to ""pound."" [Weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight) on the other hand is a special type of force where the acceleration is that of the relevant gravitational acceleration, so if we're talking about weight, formally we should be reporting those in Newtons (N) or pounds-force.

Part of the confusion comes in that typically when we ""weigh"" something, we're using a scale (EDIT: and assuming we're using a spring scale or equivalent as opposed to a balance scale) that is calibrated for use in Earth's gravity so the conversion between force and mass is baked into the scale, i.e., when we put a 10 kg mass on a scale, you can think about it effectively measuring a 98 N force, but the scale is calibrated to read 10 kg, i.e., the mass, because we assume gravity is ~9.8 m/s^(2). Whether that scale reports units of pound(-mass) or kg, it's reporting a mass, which assuming we're on Earth, will be accurate. If we used that same scale on the Moon, it would report the wrong mass. In common usage, the terms ""mass"" and ""weight"" get used interchangeably, even though they shouldn't be. Similarly, most of the time, when we discuss ""weighing"" something, we should actually be talking about ""massing"" something (or determining the mass, etc.) unless we're actually using a scale that reports units of weight (force) (but again, typically we *are* actually measuring a weight, but it's being converted to and reported in mass units).

Another source of confusion is when you see things like ""What would you weigh on the Moon?"" and the answer is reported in kg (or lb). Here, what is usually being reported is actually the answer to a different question, specifically, ""What mass (e.g., in kg) on Earth would have the same weight (e.g., in N) on Earth as the weight your mass would have on the Moon?"""
45,"One of the basics when studying Bose-Einstein condensates is that condensation occurs in the momentum space (a k-space), what does the term “condensation” mean within this k-space?","This is my humble understanding:

Within the context of Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC), ""condensation"" in k-space (momentum space) refers to the phenomenon where a large number of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state, corresponding to zero momentum (k=0). 

In a Bose-Einstein condensate, when the temperature of a gas of bosons is lowered to near absolute zero, a significant fraction of the particles ""condense"" into the lowest energy state, due to the bosonic property of being able to occupy the same quantum state with no limit. This results in a peak in the momentum distribution of the particles at k=0.

To visualize it: If you plotted the number of atoms versus their momentum in k-space, for a BEC you would see a sharp spike at zero momentum, indicating that many atoms have exactly the same (and minimal) momentum. This is the ""condensation"" in momentum space."
46,What is the smallest gravitational force we have recorded?,"If it would be zero for an atom, why would it be non-zero for a collection of atoms?

Anyway: We know neutrons and individual atoms are subject to Earth's gravity. The force on a neutron is 1.6\*10^(-26) N. Everything substantially lighter is either too short-living to be tested, escapes without interactions, or has an electric charge (electrons/positrons) completely dominating its acceleration.

Source masses in the milligram range have been used, as well, with forces of the order of 10^(-13) N."
47,Will a dead body sunburn?,"The answer is actually yes, but you won't see it.  

When the body dies, it does so in stages.  Clinical death is the cessation of circulatory function.  Even though the heart and brain have stopped, some.of the cells of the body will remain alive for a period of time.  These cells can be damaged by sunlight, and technically yes, there will be a sunburn.  Due to the lack of circulation, there won't be the telltale redness due to inflammation or blistering in more severe cases, but the underlying pathology of a sunburn can still occur within a few hours of death."

50,"what is taste? (like, when you eat something and it tastes good, what is happening in the brain?)","This answer is kinda vague and other people can probably explain it better, but I thought I’d have a go because I find this stuff interesting. 
Whether you perceive something as good or bad is completely subjective. Taste and flavour have specific scientific meanings and are not the same thing. 
There are different tastes: sweet, salty, bitter, sour, umami. There are lots of chemicals for each taste that have varying intensities of said taste. E.g. sugar and sweeteners are all perceived as sweet, but to different levels. 
Flavour/aroma chemicals are the ones that give things their characteristic flavour when combined with the appropriate amount taste. There are 1000s of chemicals that can contribute to a flavour. I think coffee for example has around 800 chemicals that make up its flavour. 
The same flavour chemicals can be found in completely different foods at different concentrations and in countless combinations, and the way we perceive the flavour depends on the whole profile of chemicals that are there."
51,How do people that drink alcohol not kill off the microflora in their stomach?,"The key is concentration.  The ideal mix of alcohol to water for killing things off is 70% alcohol to 30% water (or other stuff).  

Hard liquor is usually 30-45% alcohol, so not in the most effective range as is, and when you factor in how much liquid resides normally in the stomach, and that the majority of the alcohol is absorbed by the stomach and small intestine, before it even gets to the key parts of our internal microflora, it's a pretty safe place for bacteria."
52,How did the first transatlantic message take 16 hours to cross via cable?,">*Can someone shed some light on how electricity can slow down to under 200 miles per hour?*

It didn't. The 16 hours was not the time for the propagation of electricity, but the time to send *the entire message*.

The message consisted of several thousand symbols, which were sent at a rate of about four symbols per minute.

Since the message was not correctly received from the first try, the recipient requested some parts to be re-sent, and this went back and forth several times, until the entire telegram was received correctly. This is why it took so long. (The [""Report of the Joint Committee Appointed by the Lords of the Committee of Privy Council for Trade and the Atlantic Telegraph Company, to Inquire Into the Construction of Submarine Telegraph Cables""](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Report_of_the_Joint_Committee_Appointed/76HmAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA232&printsec=frontcover&bshm=rimc/1) reproduces the complete exchange with the timestamps.)

The symbols were sent with so much space between them to avoid interference between the symbols. This relates to the signals of different frequency [propagating at a different velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_condition) and overlapping with each other:

>*Dispersion of telegraph pulses, if severe enough, will cause them to overlap with adjacent pulses, causing what is now called intersymbol interference. To prevent intersymbol interference it was necessary to reduce the transmission speed of the transatlantic telegraph cable to the equivalent of 1⁄15 baud. This is an exceptionally slow data transmission rate, even for human operators who had great difficulty operating a morse key that slowly.*"

Dust from the Sahara reaches the Amazon and sometimes central Europe, thousands of kilometers away. Does that count as wind from the Sahara reaching these places?"
57,Why are submarines and torpedoes blunt instead of being pointy?,"A pointy nose *isn't* the best shape for reducing drag.  Because it's longer than a blunt nose there's more surface area for friction to act on.  This is ""form drag"", and a teardrop shape with a blunt nose and a sharp tail does the best at minimizing it.  So that's the shape most submarines and airplanes are based on.  Check out a passenger airliner: the nose isn't very sharp.

Where a sharp nose does help is in pushing the air or water out of the way more gradually and less abruptly.  That means less energy gets lost in creating waves: surface waves in water, or sound waves in air.  And so ships that travel at the water's surface, and supersonic airplanes, have sharp noses to minimize ""wave drag""."

There are borderline cases like a jovian mass planet orbiting something that’s straddling between a planet and a brown dwarf (DH Tauri Bb), and there’s Kepler-1625 and Kepler-1708 where the moons are gigantic enough to be detected by transits. We also have a candidate found via the changes in transit timing of the parent planet at Kepler-1513 that may actually be quite Solar System-massed."
63,Do lakes have a minimum depth for a given surface area?,"In short, no. The average, minimum, or maximum depth of a lake will reflect the interplay of a set of different controls:

1. Shape of the basin containing the lake and the origin of that basin. The underlying shape (of the ""basement"" at least) will be different depending on tectonic setting, e.g., a lake basin might be very asymmetric in cross section if it forms in a [half graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-graben) whereas it might be more symmetric if it forms in a [graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graben). Also critical is the elevation of the lowest area containing the lake, i.e., the rim. The total height of the surface of the lake will be limited by the lowest point along the rim (if the lake fills above this point, it will spill into the adjacent lowland).
2. The combination of rate of sediment influx into the lake, which will largely be a product of the rate of uplift and erosion of the areas around the lake, and the rate of subsidence of the lake bottom. Together these control how much space there is for water, e.g., if sediment flux is very high but subsidence is very low then sediment will be filling up most of the space that could be occupied by water.
3. The combination of discharge into the lake and evaporation off the lake (and other forms of loss, e.g., groundwater infiltration). This will depend on the climate of the area immediately around the lake (mostly for the evaporation bit) and the climate of the catchment area of the lake, which depending on the details could be very different than that of the lake. E.g., consider a large lake like the Caspian where its catchment area is very large and the climates within the catchment area are pretty varied.

So, from above, we could certainly get an estimate of expected depths if we have values for all these parameters, but it's not going to be a simple proportionality between surface area and depth. We can see this with natural lakes, e.g., [Lake Baikal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Baikal) has a pretty small surface area but is very deep where as the [Caspian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea) has a pretty large surface area but is not that deep (in the modern at least). The differences between these reflect differences in the parameters above (e.g., the rate of subsidence in Baikal is very high whereas the rate of sedimentation into the Caspian is pretty high, etc). While simple averages for the various inputs will get you close for a given lake, pretty much all of these parameters vary through space and with time, so it gets messy, very quickly. 

If anyone wants a deep dive into some of these controls, there are a suite of kind of classic papers from the late 90's early 2000's covering the interesting dynamics of lakes (e.g., [Carroll & Bohacs, 1999](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/27/2/99/207139/Stratigraphic-classification-of-ancient-lakes), [Bohacs et al., 2000](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/aapg/books/book/1304/chapter-abstract/107164492/Lake-Basin-Type-Source-Potential-and-Hydrocarbon), and [Bohacs et al., 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/519/chapter-abstract/3801181/Lessons-from-large-lake-systems-Thresholds)). Several of these contain specifically plots of things like area vs maximum depth (e.g., Figure 1 of Bohacs et al., 2003) that show no meaningful simple relationship. You can kind of define relationships between volume and maximum depth or volume and area (the other panels of that figure), but they're pretty bad in terms of prediction with depth vs volume being the best, but with *a lot* of scatter.

**EDIT** To add specifically something about the aspect of the question with relation to whether there is a minimum depth where the lake would not persist and/or expectations for surface area to depth relationships as a lake dries up. This has less specifically to do with depth and more to do with the average precipitation/evaporation ratio. If this ratio is greater than 1, you would broadly expect the water volume to increase, if it equals 1 the water volume would stay roughly constant, and less than 1 the water volume would decrease until the lake drys up. The linked sources again have plots of P/E ratios vs a variety of physical characteristics (area, volume, depth) and again show effectively no relationship. Of course, for a lake with a P/E < 1, this by definition would be an *ephemeral* feature assuming the P/E stays < 1, so the depth of the lake will gradually decrease until it is zero. The way the average, max, minimum depth scales with surface area as the lake volume decreases will be a function of the shape of the basin containing the lake, so you would only expect a universal relationship if the bathymetry of all lakes were the same (they're not, so you do not expect a single relationship). More specifically, if we take a look at models used to estimate evaporative potential for a lake (and thus a control on the P/E ratio) like those discussed in [Morton, 1983a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169483901774), and [Morton, 1983b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022169483901786), you'll see that lake depth is not formally considered. In detail, it plays a role of sorts in that for ""shallow lakes"" (where what constitutes shallow is not made particularly clear in these papers) depth is not considered at all, whereas for ""deep lakes"", depth does play a role as you have to account for heat storage within the water column. Since OPs question is specifically about a minimum depth, the ""shallow"" lake case is probably more relevant and in these, depth is not necessary to consider in terms of evaporation, only climatological/atmospheric details.

**EDIT 2** For all of the people arguing about semantics, there is no formal definition in terms of physical dimensions that defines something as a *lake* as opposed to another name for a water body filling an enclosed topographic depression, so this is not a particularly useful path to go down in terms of trying to answer OPs question."
64,Where does the water go when we drink it? In stomach?If yes then why doesn't it react with HCL,"Water goes directly through the esophagus and stomach and gets absorbed through the intestine into the blood.

65,Does Hot and Cold weather affect birds and planes ability to fly? If so do they fly best in high or low temperature environments?,"Hot weather can affect aircraft performance due to decreased air density, which can reduce lift and engine efficiency. Cold weather can affect birds and planes if it causes ice formation. Because of this, both birds and planes typically perform best in moderate temperature environments."
66,"When an airplane accelerates, is the air pressure in the back of the plane higher than in the front?","Solving the hydrostatic equation for the air inside the accelerating plane, the acceleration and pressure gradient are related by 

ρa = ∇P.

If the plane accelerates at 0.5g, and the cabin is pressurized to an equivalent altitude of 5000 ft (ρ = 1.06 kg/m^(3)), the pressure gradient within the cabin is 5.19 Pa/m. If the pressure varies linearly along the length of the cabin, and the plane is 76 m long (approximate length of a 747), then the pressure difference between front and back is around 394 Pa. 

The standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 101325 Pa, so the difference calculated above is about 0.4% of that."

69,What does impact the day/night cycle of a planet ?,"That's \*basically\* it.  The day/night cycle is just asking when is a given point facing the Sun and when is it pointed away from the Sun.  Inclination of the axis is important because if you're on a part of the planet that's sufficiently pointed towards the Sun, then you'll never have night (and conversely for away and day), and if you're just close to that then you'll have really long days (nights)--this is what's going on with day length varying with the seasons.  Once you've got your tilt fixed, the only other factor is how fast you're spinning.

Now one factor that \*can\* kick in is the fact that you're moving around the Sun as well.  If the time it takes to spin is relatively close to how long it takes to move around the Sun, then it can change how long the day/night cycle is.  (For Earth, the two aren't really close, but it still makes a small difference--if you were measuring the Earth's spin relative to something like the distant stars instead of the Earth, you'd say the Earth made one rotation every 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4 seconds or so.)  So if you move your planet really close to its Sun, this could be a major effect.

Satellites won't affect the length of the day/night cycle outside of the above--tidal effects will change the rotation rate over long periods, but that's not going to be showing up on anything like a human timescale.  I suppose you could have frequent eclipses doing something \*like\* changing the day/night cycle."

72,How do you start and shutdown a nuclear reactor?,"To start the reaction you just have to put enough fissile material closely together. As a radioactive material the atomic nuclei are unstable and some randomly break apart emitting neutrons. These neutrons can hit another nucleus breaking it apart and creating a chain reaction.

To make this stable and more fuel efficient a moderating material is added between pallets or rods of the fuel. This material slows down the neutrons to increase their chance of hitting another nucleus.

To stop the reactor you insert the control rods between the reactor material to absorb neutrons. Once the chain reaction is slowed by the absorbing material and everything is cooled down you can start removing the fissile material and disassemble.

In principle you could also stop it by moving the fissile material farther apart."

* This wave function has positive and negative signs in different areas, kind of like a water wave has higher-than-average and lower-than-average areas. 
* The importance to chemistry of these areas comes when we add up orbital wave functions on individual atoms to make hybrid orbitals or bonds. Areas in the same phase will reinforce, areas in opposite phases will (partly) cancel out.
* Places where the wave function transitions from one phase to the other are called “nodes” and in general the more nodes an orbital has the higher the energy. 
* The actual probability of finding an electron in any given area is proportional to the *square* of the wave function’s value there. Since the square of a negative number is positive, electron probabilities start at zero and sum to 100% over the full volume of the atom. 
* The shapes you see in textbooks are basically balloons drawn to enclose most of the electron density. 

The above is a very simplified view. It’s not intended to be super-rigorous, but it is intended to be useful. Apologies to quantum-physicists who read this and regard me as a babbling fool.  I survived (barely) having to do the requisite calculations of Hamiltonian integrals in 3-dimensional polar coordinates, many years ago. Now I can just wave my hands and say “then math happens” and draw the cartoons. 

If there are serious inaccuracies in my description, though, I’m good for corrections as long as it sticks to the level required for sophomore organic chemistry…"
74,Has anything been found as to why nuclear-powered pulsars max out at 760 revolutions per second? Does gravity get more intense with greater speed?,"You're a little out of date -- [current theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond_pulsar#Pulsar_rotational_speed_limits) suggest they'd break apart past 1,500 revolutions per second, and gravitational radiation vs acceleration via accretion [suggests](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0307029) a cap at \~1,000 revolutions per second, not 760 (where's that number from?)."
75,"When we say ""10 seconds after the Big Bang"" - what frame of reference we are using here?","Any reference frame where the universe is isotropic, i.e. the same in all directions. If you choose a different reference frame then you would notice that most of the matter moves in a specific direction, or in other words you have chosen a reference frame that moves relative to all the matter in the universe. We avoid doing that."
76,Have any land plants returned to aquatic life like whales?,"Yes, probably the best example are seagrasses.  There are many species that live in the ocean and are completely submerged for their whole lifecycle.  

There are also semiaquatic marine plants like mangroves and various reeds, and a huge number of fully aquatic freshwater plants."
77,why don't small pieces of steel not held down by anything fly or at least drift northwards?,"You only get a net force on an object if the field strength increases in one direction. If you play with magnets on your desk that's often the case - the field will be stronger close to the magnet and you can easily notice a difference over e.g. 1 cm. Earth's magnetic field is as large as the planet, however. Its strength in one place and the strength a centimeter closer to the north pole is essentially the same. It's not *exactly* the same, but the difference is too small to lead to a measurable force on the magnet.

There is no net force on a compass needle - the needle as a whole doesn't want to move north or south. The north pole is pulled north essentially as much as the south pole is pulled south. You only get a torque, rotating it so the magnetic north pole of the needle is closer to the geographic north pole and the magnetic south pole is closer to the geographic south pole."
78,Why are poisonous animals colorful?,"This is an example of aposematism, and that's exactly how it works.

Generally predators are pretty smart. They have to outwit their prey. So they can generally learn to avoid the brightly coloured animals.

And also, exactly as you say, there are plenty of mimic animals that have the energetically cheap bright colouring without the energetically expensive poisons, so animals that have learned about the dangerous ones will leave them alone.

There are efforts ongoing in Australia to train quolls that cane toads are poisonous. It's fairly easy to train any individual. The question is can the trained ones pass this knowledge onto their offspring."
79,"If a tick feeds on blood from a person on medication, can that affect the tick?","Yes. This is how pet tick medications work. Once the drug reaches a sufficient concentration in your pet's bloodstream, a tick biting your pet gets a lethal dose of the drug within the blood it ingests. Ivermectin, for example, makes your blood lethal to mosquitos for about a month. Some versions of this strategy don't kill the parasite directly, but operate on the hope that the parasite will carry some toxin back to it's home colony for greater suppressive effect."
80,Why does the ocean floor sharply drop off?,"So what you're describing is the *continental slope*, which is the steep section oceanward of the *shelf break* between the *continental shelf* (the very gentle part near shore) and the *continental rise* (the slightly steep part sloping into the deeper ocean floor, or abyssal plain), e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#/media/File:Bathmetry.png). This type of bathymetry is what we see along [passive margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin), where there is a transition between [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust) and [oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust) that reflects the site of a former continental [rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift). Continental crust is less dense and thicker than oceanic crust so the average surface elevation of the former is higher than the latter (and also why we have continents and ocean basins in the first place). 

The continental shelf part of a passive margin is a flooded portion of the continental crust and the continental rise is oceanic crust, with the continental slope largely being a transition between the two types of crust. In terms of its bathymetry, the continental slope is steep largely because the transition between these two crust type is abrupt, represented by a relatively thin zone of *transitional crust* that you see in the diagram. As the name implies, transitional crust has a density and thickness between oceanic and continental crust and it's a product of the [original rifting process that split the former continent and started to form oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#/media/File:Formation_of_passive_margins.png). 

Many of these margins will be partially capped in some amount of sediment shed off the adjacent continent (which you can see in the [diagram of a passive margin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#/media/File:Passive_Contiental_Margin.jpg)), but these sediments tend to at least in part mirror that same abrupt transition because they effectively tend to be stacks of thin drapes of sediments. As an example, imagine draping a sets of thin sheets of cloth over the edge of a stair-step, the surface of the stack of cloth sheets will be end up a slightly smoothed form of the same underlying shape but with the location of the ""hinge"" a bit offset from the location of the hinge in the underlying stair-step (i.e., the transition in crust types in the real passive margin). Thus, some of the shape of a stereotypical passive margin is controlled by the geometry of the sediment packages that drape it (e.g., [this diagram](https://web.viu.ca/earle/geol201/passive-margin.gif)). Finally, it's worth noting the above is describing what we call a non-volcanic (or magma-poor) rifted margin, which is the most common type of passive margin, but there are other types which result in different bathymetries. For example, [volcanic rifted margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin#Volcanic_rifted_margin), as the name implies, instead tend to have the transition from continental to oceanic crust draped in a large volume of volcanic rocks, which still results in a similar shape, but where the continental shelf is usually narrower and the continental slope is steeper (e.g., the eastern margin of Brazil or Australia)."
81,What happens live attenuated virus from chickenpox vaccine after generating immune response?,"The live attenuated virus uses a very low amount of a weakened version of the virus. You don't actually get the infection, it is just enough of the weakened virus to produce a antibody reaction. 

From what I understand with Shingles, you actually need to catch chickenpox, the disease, and have a full viral load of the active virus in order to have the chance to get Shingles in the future."
82,"How were we able to know the gravitational force on planets like Mars, their weight, and distance from the Earth with very very limited technology?","We didn't know them until telescopes had been developed.

Relative distances in the Solar System are pretty easy to calculate because the orbital period and the distance to the Sun follow a known relation (Kepler's third law).

The next step is the absolute scale in the Solar System. There are a few methods but most of them rely on parallax: You measure the apparent position of things (Moon, Venus, Mars) from different places on Earth to find the ratio between your distance on Earth (with a known size of Earth) and the distance to the object. In case of the Moon you need another step to find the ratio Earth-Moon distance to Earth-Sun distance.

Mars has two moons, so measuring their orbital period and distance to Mars tells us the mass of Mars. Measuring the apparent size of Mars, combined with the distance to it, tells us the radius. Mass and radius (and the known gravitational constant) determine the surface gravity.

Venus doesn't have moons but its gravity still has a measurable influence on the other planets. That is much harder to measure, but still something we could do long before spacecraft were sent there. The size was known earlier, and with a size very similar to Earth people (correctly) expected that its density won't be that different, which leads to a relatively good mass estimate as well."
83,What determines the type of decay undergone by U-239?,">Does this mean it needs to be in an excited state (the gamma particle) for this to occur?

No.

^(238)U(n,Ɣ) just means that ^(238)U is capturing a neutron; it's how the ^(239)U is produced in this case.

^(239)U in the ground state decays approximately 100% of the time via beta decay. From excited states, there can be branches for other decays, depending on the excited state."
84,What is the mechanism of action of an alum block or styptic pencil?,"Alum blocks and styptic pencils work as astringents by causing proteins in skin cells and blood vessels to contract. Specifically, they contain aluminum sulfate, which forms bonds with proteins, tightening and constricting tissues. This constriction helps stop minor bleeding by sealing small blood vessels."
85,When was the far side of the Moon last visible from Earth?,"We dont really know but it would have been quick on the order of 10s of millions of years at most. 

To understand why this is not easy to know we can turn to the [tidal locking timescale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking#Timescale) which estimates the time taken for an object to tidally lock. A lot of these parameters are unknown such as the initial angular momentum but more problematic is the parameter Q known as the tidal quality factor. Q parameterises the amount of dissipation of tidal energy, in this case within the Moon. The present day estimate for the Lunar Q is 27 and using this one can estimate the depinning timescale as 10^7 years. Note that this is an e-folding timescale which means it is the timescale for the spin to reduce by a factor of e. Given we do not know the initial spin we can not really say how long it actually took to tidally lock but we can probably take this as a reasonable upper estimate. However, I would expect that the Moon was much more dissipative in its history than it is today and so it is likely quite a bit faster than this.

86,Are some genes more recessive than others?,"Yes, some alleles can be more recessive than other recessive alleles. It is possible to have a genetically determined trait with alleles such as B (dominant), b₁ (recessive to B dominant over b₂), and b₂ (recessive to both). Green/Hazel (G) often work this way, being dominant over Blue (b) but recessive to Brown (B). Hazel itself is dominant over Green with a separate modifier gene that adds more melanin (G with M = Hazel, G with m = Green). As I understand it, the M allele does nothing to blue eyes, so blue-eyed people may or may not carry it and there's little way to tell.\*

So if your father is bb GG MM (Hazel) and your mother bb bb mm (Blue), their children should always be bb Gb Mm (Hazel, but maybe not quite as dark as the father's if the melanin gene shows incomplete dominance, which I forget if it does). But it's also possible your father could be say, bb Gb Mm (still Hazel), in which case there's a 50-50 chance and both of you just ended up flipping a heads instead of a tails.

However, this is using only three genes, which is only an approximation of how it actually works. Eye colour in truth is a complex polygenic trait that is not a simple mendelian affair. Eye colour is affected by at least eight genes (and we haven't tracked them all down- only 85% of eye colour variation can be explained by models I've seen). It also is affected by environment (notable as eyes can change colour over time or due to injury, and twins with the exact same genes can have differences in eye pigmentation due to how the melanin actually ends up in the iris). As a famous example of how complicated this can be, although the simplified version using only those three genes says it's impossible, two blue-eyed parents can occasionally have a brown-eyed child.

Furthermore, many non-eye colour traits can also affect this (for example, asian brown eyes have a much darker maximum than european brown eyes), including sex- women are significantly more likely to have green eyes than men, while men more often had blue eyes than women, suggesting that there is an unknown gender-related factor that conditions 'edge cases'."
87,Why is that we only see one side of the moon?,"The short answer is that the Moon rotates on its axis exactly once for every time it orbits the Earth. When it has travelled half way around its orbit, it has also rotated half way, so it still shows us the same side.

The mechanism that has caused this is a process called tidal locking, which is a complicated interaction between the gravity of Earth pulling on the Moon and slowing its rotation until it matched the period of its orbit."
88,What is Venus’s tilt? Rotation? Is it “upside down”? How?,"**TLDR : The leading theory is actually atmospheric tides ([Correia and Laskar 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/35081000)). Essentially atmospheric tides have an opposite signed torque to solid body tides.**

Giant impactors of which we have no real evidence for, are not required. The dense atmosphere alone is sufficient.

Atmospheric (or thermal) tides come about due to thermal heating from the host star or some other source. This causes a redistribution of mass due to thermal expansion as well as through convective flows. Redistribution of mass away from a azimuthal symmetry (rotational symmetry) is exactly what convectional tides do. Essentially this then changes the gravitational potential of the object and can adjust its spin-orbit parameters.

The consequence of this is that the solid body tides act to try to reduce the spin to be synchronised with the orbit (approach tidal locking). As synchronisation is approached, the solid body tide becomes weaker. Essentially the transition towards a tidally locked state is an asymptotic one. At some point the atmospheric tide will then become of a similar order of magnitude (similar strength) and so starts to play a role. Since it has an opposite signed torque one would expect the ""tidally locked"" (I use quotes here because this is a subtle definition issue) to not quite be a spin-orbit synchronous state.


So I guess I should answer the question at hand. With the above in mind the leading theory as to the retrograde rotation means that Venus has not flipped but simply gravitational torques have settled the planet to have this tidally locked state (a one sided minimum energy state) which is not quite synchronous.

Edit - lets add something about Uranus since it has been mentioned in here too. We know a lot less about Uranus but recently it was demonstrated ([Rogoszinski and Hamilton 2020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14913)) that a few small impacts in combination with orbital resonances with Saturn/Jupiter are sufficient to tilt the planet. By small impacts I mean terrestrial planet size. A single giant impact is not sufficient to explain the tilting. A more recent alternative is by migration of an ancient satellite ([Saillenfest et al. 2022](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10590))"
89,When the earth's magnetic poles flip is it instant or would it be slow enough that compasses can follow it as it changes?,"It's definitely not instant on human timescales. In terms of geomagnetic reversals, these are not really ""flips"" in a simple sense, but more like a somewhat chaotic drift of the geomagnetic poles from being near one rotational axis to the other (e.g., [Channel & Lehman, 1997](https://www.nature.com/articles/39570)). In detail though, while we can still approximate the positions of the two magnetic poles (i.e., approximate the field as a [dipole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole)) during a reversal, in reality what seems to be happen during reversals is that (1) the overall field intensity is significantly diminished and (2) the non-dipole components (i.e., multi-pole components of the field) become more dominant during the reversal (e.g., [Valet et al., 2005](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03674), [Valet  & Fournier, 2016](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015RG000506)). 

With respect to the timescale of the reversal, we (geologists) often discuss geomagnetic reversals as occurring ""rapidly"" (in terms of how long it takes for the field to reverse), but the important thing to remember is that we're talking ""rapid"" in a geologic time sense, not a human timescale sense. Most records (and simulations e.g., [Coe et al., 2000](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2000.0578)) of reversals suggest that the intensity of the field likely declines for hundreds to thousands of years preceding the reversal and also takes hundreds to thousands of years to ""recover"" after the reversal. The compilation of several well preserved reversals by Valet et al. ([2012](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11491)) highlights that all of these can be described by a 3 stage process, (1) a precursor ""excursion"", (2) the reversal, and (3) a rebound ""excursion"". Figure 4b in there paper is the most clear about what this means, but basically, in the precursor phase the pole will drift from the original pole to close to the equator over the course of ~1250 years and then drift back to it's original location over another ~1250 years (so 2500 years for the whole precursor).  The actual reversal occurs ~1000 years after this precursor and itself takes ~1000 to complete, i.e., the pole drifts from its original location to its new location 180 degrees away. Then relatively shortly after the reversal, there is a rebound (similar to the precursor) where the newly reversed pole drifts back to the equator and then back to the new position over another ~2500 year period. 

The above appears to be the default behavior for a variety of reversals, but there is variability. The absolute fastest reversal we've ever found a record of skipped the precursor stage from above and the actual reversal took ~100 years and was followed by a more typical duration ""rebound"" (e.g., [Sagnotti et al., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/199/2/1110/618671), [Sagnotti et al., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/204/2/798/593407)).

**TL;DR** from paleomagnetic records of past field reversals, these are best described as drifts from one pole to the other (with both a precursor and rebound phases where the pole moves to the equator and then back to either the original or new pole location) with the whole process spanning ~8-10 thousand years and the main reversal taking ~1 thousand years. The absolute fastest we've ever found is a reversal that took ~100 years. So yes, definitely slow enough to follow with a compass over your entire life in the ""extremely rapid"" case or over the span of *many* generations in the more default case."
90,What is the post-spawn survival rate for landlocked salmon?,"Atlantic salmon post-spawn survival rates are *quite* variable by which river they return to, with [some rivers showing 0% and some rivers showing return rates as high as 26%](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/cjfas-2022-0126). The *average* is maybe closer to 5% than 10%…but all that to say that any analysis of landlocked salmon will be specific to their isolated population.

In one study of a specific landlocked Newfoundland population, [twenty percent of salmon returned multiple years](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eff.12279). That’s definitely on the high end, but it’s not the *absolute* largest number, and I don’t have measurements for other landlocked populations."
91,How do stallions and male zebras attract females to their harems?,"I think you're thinking about this the wrong way.

Females group for protection, shared young care, predator/prey spotting, and all the benefits of the herd.

Males then insert themselves to mate, and drive off competitors for as long as they can, until they are dethroned.  Sired sons are driven off or leave at sexual maturity.

This is true with lions, walruses, and elephants, so I dont see a reason why it wouldn't be true with horses and zebras.

Edit:  To clarify, the males come to the females, not the other way around.  Lone males are picked off by predators."

93,Is it coincidence volcanoes are in the North Cascade Range?,"The western margin of North America has been effectively an east dipping [subduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) zone (i.e., oceanic lithosphere to the west of North America is sinking underneath the western margin of North America) for several 100s of millions of years. For example. consider this [plate reconstruction animation](https://portal.gplates.org/cesium/?view=AgeGrid) which goes back 230 million years. Subduction zones (and other convergent boundaries) on this are denoted with blue lines with little triangular ""teeth"" where the teeth are in the side of the boundary that is on top (i.e., the side not subducting). If you watch that animation, you'll see there is some strangeness where the polarity (i.e., which side of the boundary is subducting) may have temporarily flipped, but since ~150 million years, the western margin of North America has been an east dipping subduction zone, essentially without interruption (until about 30 million years ago when the [San Andreas Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#Formation) began to form, converting portions of the boundary to a transform boundary). While the type of boundary has remained static for a while, this doesn't mean the boundary isn't changing at all. The rocks that make up Mount Shuksan referenced in your question are part of what we would describe as an [*accreted terrane*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrane), i.e., a small slice of crust that is ""accreted"" onto the edge of a continent when that slice of crust encounters a subduction zone and can't easily (or fully) subduct. When this happens, we typically think of the subduction zone ""jumping"" to the side of the accreted bit that still has oceanic lithosphere, i.e., the boundary stays the same type, but it moves its location a bit and the accreted terrane becomes part of (and moves with) the plate to which it was accreted. What this also means is that the western margin of North America is an amalgam of accreted terranes and [*arc volcanism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_arc) (like Mount Baker), which both are representative of the protracted history of east-dipping subduction along this boundary. Since  this boundary has stayed in approximately same location and same polarity for a while, much of this is history is superimposed on top of itself and all of it has been moving with the North American plate.

For the Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain, this is a very different feature and instead represents [hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28geology%29) volcanism. The simple idea with hotspot volcanism is that it typically represents material associated with a [mantle plume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plume), whose location is semi-static from the perspective of an external reference frame, with plates moving over this semi-static spot. In reality, things are a [bit more complicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/hawaii_seamount_bend/) since we don't think hotspots/plumes are actually 100% static in terms of their location, but for the purposes of this question we can largely ignore this complication.

**TL;DR** - in the simplest possible terms, you're comparing (1) a location (northern Washington) that has effectively been on the edge of the same plate for a long time and thus it (and the associated features on it) have been moving with that plate (i.e., their motion relative to each other is close to zero, but they and the rest of the plate has been moving relative to an external reference frame) to (2) a location (Hawaii-Emperor) that represents a semi-fixed location in an external reference frame but where the plates have been moving over it."
94,How do the fractional charges in quarks work?,"Before we knew (or even suspected) that quarks existed we defined the magnitude of charge Electrons and Protons have as 1 (negative and positive respectively).  There is no inherent reason it had to be 1 though.  We could have defined it as 3 or 300, its not like an Egg where we could count it, BUT it seemed like electrons, protons, and neutrons were the base particles, so lets make it 1.

Later on we discovered quarks and that protons (and neutrons) were made up of quarks.  Now there was a problem.  The charges on quarks had to add up to +1 or 0.  But they came in sets of 3.  So now we had to divide the elementary charge in thirds.  We could have simple redefined the elementary charge such that Protons and Electrons had +3 and -3 respectively, but that would have been complicated in its own way.  So things stayed the same for Protons and Electrons and Quark values were simply reported as fractions of that."
95,How many revolutions do hurricanes make in a day?,"Weather guy here.  First a little background, then on to your question.

Air is a fluid, it doesn't like being squeezed very much, and it can move up and down as well as horizontally.  Gravity holds it down, and it stacks up under it's own weight.  So, air is denser near the surface where it's getting squished by the air above it, and less so the higher you go.

Now let's start moving things.  Rising air expands (less squished) which makes it cooler as it goes.  Sinking air gets squished and warms up.  Now add water vapor to the mix and rising/cooling air can get to the point where the air reaches 100% humidity, so the water fall out.  Now the big trick -- That condensation releases heat, making the air warmer, so it wants to rise more, which releases more water, and bing, bang, boom:  Thunderstorm!  Yes, yes, major simplification here, but getting to the point of the question.

Next part:  Draw a circle.  The air goes round and round, but doesn't change position in and out.  Now draw a spiral moving toward a center.   Air at the surface following a spiral will get squished as moves along the line by the other air nearby.  This is called a line of convergence.   Draw several spirals in the gaps between the first spiral -- maybe 2 or 3.   Now you're starting to see the hurricane radar spiral pattern.

The low pressure area (and other mechanics - NVM those) in the middle attracts air from the outside and lifts it into the upper atmosphere.  A thunderstorm starts doing it's thing.   Now that the ball is rolling, more air flows in, rather, spirals in, and convergence lines develop, and more thunderstorms fire off.  Under the right conditions this whole system becomes very strong and widespread:  Hurricane!

So how many times does it spin, you ask?  Difficult question, because it isn't solid like a bicycle wheel.  The outer edge winds might be only 20 knots, while a hundred miles away, the center winds are 150 knots or more.  On top of that, the thunderstorms are not moving with the wind, they are moving with the impulses that form convergence lines, like a surfer riding a wave.  So there is no single thing (surfboard) to track while moving through the pattern (waves).

Let's take a medium storm and make a SWAG (Scientific Wild Ass Guess):  Eye is 20 miles across, eye wall winds 100 kts.  Circumference = Pi x Diameter, so the eye is 63 miles around.  A weather balloon floating along with the wind would circle the eye (ignoring rising air) 1.6 times per hour.  The further away, the slower the winds, so the fewer trips around.

Hope that helps!"
96,Why doesn't convection from a welding flame kill the welder?,"There's way less mass involved in welding, so the heated air is just a tiny fraction of what you'd have with a pool full of lava. Yes, the temperature is high, but high temperature on tiny mass equals small energy (heat)."
97,What happens to matter that falls into stars?,"The material that makes up the object would just behave like the rest of the star once it has been converted to plasma. So essentially it will respond exactly like the rest of the electrically conducting fluid. If we consider just some blob of the original material we could ask the question of where that blob might go. This essentially is a question of the efficiency of mixing processes within a star which is an active area of research.

Lower mass stars (by this I mean anything from the smallest star up beyond the mass of the Sun) have convective envelopes with efficient mixing. This means so material can be dragged down by convective downflows and lifted by buoyant plumes. In contrast high mass stars have stably stratified exteriors (no convective motion) and so mixing should be far less efficient and hence the material should remain closer to the surface. However, the question of mixing within stars, and in particular high mass stars, is tricky. Even in the absence of convection there are mixing processes such as internal gravity waves ([Rogers and McElwaine 2017](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa8d13/pdf)).

It is certainly possible for some of the material to leave the star from some event like a mass ejection or the likes."
98,"What does self-assembling, self-templating and self-propagating mean specifically in relation to proteins, in particular prions?","It means the prions themselves reshape other PRP proteins into prions.  

Basically, a prion is a specific kind of protein that gets misfolded.  Another protein of the same kind can stick on the end of one misfolded protein, forming a stick or chain of misfolded proteins that grows at both ends.  When it gets long enough and breaks, now there are two growing sticks, and then they get long enough and break and grow and break and eventually the cell fills up with tangles of protein sticks and dies."
99,"Why is the whole Martian surface mostly red, when the geology of earth has a wide variety in rock colour?","We'll start with the caveat that from the surface [Mars is less *red* than it is *butterscotch* and that there is some variability in color depending on area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_surface_color). Caveats aside, the lower diversity of rock colors - and in general the lower diversity of rock types - on Mars compared to Earth is primarily a reflection that Mars does not have plate tectonics (and likely never did, or at least not tectonics like Earth does). The variety of rock types (and corresponding compositions) we see on Earth, in large part reflects [igneous differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_differentiation) and [partial melting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_melting) wherein (in *very basic* terms) mantle peridotites are partially melted to make basalt/gabbros, basalts/gabbros are partially melted to make andesites/diorites, and andesites/diorites are partially melted to make rhyolites/granites. On Mars, we basically only see the first step (i.e., most of the surface is effectively basalts or sedimentary rocks made from weathered basalt) where the latter steps in the chain largely require active tectonic processes and the corresponding unique geochemical/thermal conditions in specific active tectonic environments. So, no active plate tectonics, no andesites/diorites or rhyolites/granites (again in *super simplified terms*). Basalt, as a [mafic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafic) rock is relatively rich in iron and iron bearing minerals, where the oxidation of iron rich minerals is a large part of the butterscotch/red color of Mars (i.e., rust, basically).

An intricately linked bit is the existence of large amounts of water, both in the form of hydrated minerals in the crust/mantle but also as free water on the surface (or correspondingly the lack of this on Mars for at least most of its history). Water is essential both to many aspects of the partial melting process and thus igneous differentiation, but also likely to functioning and persistent active Earth like plate tectonics ([see this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/tectonics_life/)). The large amounts of water, and the development of life, also allows for the development of other rock types that are not prevalent (or non existent) on Mars, e.g., carbonates, coal, etc. Carbonates are not always biologically mediated, and [there are carbonate minerals on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonates_on_Mars), but there is not evidence of large deposits of carbonates (e.g., from reef building organisms, etc.) on Mars like there are on Earth."
100,"Why does it seem earthquake ""feel"" has a directionality to it sometimes?","There are two relevant considerations:

**1. Earthquakes do have directionality.** In *extremely oversimplified terms*, you can think about an earthquake as like a portion of a fault progressively slipping, where the slipped area (i.e., the rupture) increases in size through time. Many ruptures also have a strong directional bias, i.e., it starts on part of a fault and moves along the fault plane mostly in one general direction as opposed to equally in all directions. You can very clearly see this in many earthquake simulations, [like this one of a M7.8 on the southern San Andreas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blTx92TuWHA). If you're ""upwind"" of the direction the earthquake is propagating, shaking will tend to be more intense than being downwind. Other details you can see from this simulation, when we report locations of earthquakes, we report the location of the epicenter, which is the projection to the surface of *where the earthquake started*, not necessarily where it had the most shaking (see also this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/epicenters/) about what epicenters do and do not represent and why we use them). Finally, what you can also see is that subtle changes in the geometry of the fault can dramatically change the way earthquake waves propagate along and near it such that locations that are relatively close to each other can experience *very different* amounts of shaking. To elaborate further on that point and add some additional considerations...

**2. Rock properties vary.** Shaking at the surface, both in terms of intensity and duration, depend in part on the rock properties of a given site, the geometry of the area surrounding the site, and the properties of the rocks that the seismic waves propagated through before getting to that site. Even if we imagine a completely uniform distribution of seismic waves (i.e., ignoring the directionality details from above), depending on what those seismic waves go through, different areas (at equivalent distances) can experience different shaking. This can be generalized as [seismic site effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects), e.g., seismic waves traveling through a sedimentary basin can effectively reverberate and increase shaking. Differences in attenuation (i.e., how much energy is lost as a function of distance) can also play a big role. Seismic waves traveling through very fractured rock attenuate a lot whereas seismic waves traveling through more intact rock attenuate less. This is why in the US, earthquakes of equivalent magnitudes are much more widely felt in the eastern US (where rocks are broadly more intact) than in the western US (where rocks are broadly more fractured)."
101,How does google immediately able to report earthquakes?,"I'm assuming you're asking about the Android based earthquake early warning system? All earthquake early warning systems operate using the same basic setup:

1. An array of widely distributed, always-on detectors exists and/or is establsihed
2. A portion of the array detects a signal that may indicate an earthquake and sends a message to some sort of central (automated) hub
3. The central hub collects signals from the array and quickly determines via algorithms / criteria whether the signals from the array are likely to indicate an earthquake and typically makes an estimate of the size and location of the event based on the information from the sensor array
4. The central hub sends a message to users that are connected to the hub and in regions close enough to where the system thinks there is an earthquake that might feel the earthquake and uses what is known about earthquakes (e.g., the speed of seismic waves in various mediums), the particular event (e.g., estimated size and location), and the local geology (e.g., types of materials and their seismic properties) to estimate when the waves might right reach them and some general estimate of intensity.

The above can work because the speed of seismic waves are slower than the speed at which the sensor array can communicate with the hub and the hub can send alerts, where the latter is effectively happening at the speed of light. The main difference between different early warning systems is largely what constitutes the sensor array. For early warning systems operated by governments (e.g., [ShakeAlert](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/science/earthquake-early-warning-overview) in portions of the US or similar systems in Japan, Mexico, Taiwan, etc.), the sensor array are sets of seismometers distributed throughout an area. A seismometer is effectively a specially housed, oriented, and networked set of very sensitive accelerometers. The [Android based early warning system](https://crisisresponse.google/android-alerts/) capitalizes on the fact that virtually every smartphone has an accelerometer in it and uses a crowdsourced approach in terms of monitoring the location and acceleration of lots of peoples smartphones and assumes that if almost all smartphones in an area start experiencing similar accelerations it maybe a sign of an earthquake (and from there, it largely functions as above). There are other ways to go about crowdsourced approaches as well, e.g., [LastQuake](https://www.emsc-csem.org/faq/lastquake.php) uses the location of people opening the app, going to their website, or tweeting with a few keywords (e.g., earthquake, shaking) - as opposed to direct usage of the phones accelerometers. 

It's important to consider a few common misconceptions about earthquake early warning systems. As described above, these are not detecting precursors to earthquakes, but the earthquakes themselves so these are not ""predicting"" events, but alerting us to in progress events. As such, the amount of warning provided will usually be short (seconds to minutes). This may not seem useful, but when coupled with automatic systems (e.g., systems to halt trains, etc.) and good training (e.g., individuals knowing where/how to quickly take cover), this short time can be invaluable. The limitation on these is that it comes down to a bit of luck (and/or sensor array design) in terms of the amount of warning because fundamentally for somewhere to get a warning;  (1) the earthquake needs to be far enough away from that location for it to be detected and for there a warning to be processed to be sent out and (2) there needs to be a sensor(s) near the epicenter of the earthquake (or at least closer to the epicenter than the location to get a warning). This latter point is where things like ShakeAlert can have an advantage over the Android system since arrays of seismometers are often outside populated areas (to avoid the ""noise"" generated by machines, etc) whereas the Android system basically requires some number of people with phones in an area to detect a potential earthquake. But even for the seismometer based ones, if the epicenter of an event is effectively in a populated area, that populated area won't get an alert (but other neighboring areas might). Finally, these systems can generate false positives. Especially for the seismometer based systems, a large earthquake effectively starts as a small earthquake and then builds. Thus, the system has to make quick decisions based on incomplete data whether the signals it's being fed is indicative of a small earthquake that won't be widely felt (no need to issue an alert) or the beginnings of an event that will be widely felt and strong (need to issue an alert). The ability for the system to make those decisions depends on the way it was programmed but also training data (i.e., the systems get better with time).

**TL;DR** earthquake early warning systems use signals indicative of an earthquake in progress in one area to warn people in adjacent areas that shaking from that earthquake is on its way. The Android (Google) system uses the location and acceleration of peoples phones as the signal. Other early warning systems exist as well using different ""signals"", e.g., arrays of seismometers.

**EDIT:** It's also worth pointing out that the Google based system is not without its bugs to be worked out, e.g., [it appears to have effectively failed](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66316462) in detecting/warning people in the large earthquake in eastern Turkey in February."
102,Why was South America so evolutionary isolated? And why is the wildlife in North and South America so different?,"Focusing just on large mammals, [North America had distinct megafauna very recently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene_megafauna#North_America), around the time humans first arrived (including ground sloths, tapirs, and camelids). So a partial answer to your question is ""most of North America's large mammals recently went extinct""."
103,Do clouds move with or independent of Earth’s spin?,"To a pretty good approximation, the atmosphere rotates together with the rest of Earth: 0 km/h at the poles, 1700 km/h at the equator. Deviations from that are what we call wind. Everything above ~120 km/h difference to the ground is called hurricane-force, even though it's not even 10% of the rotation speed of Earth at the equator, so the differences are pretty small. At higher altitudes wind can be stronger but it's still not getting anywhere close to 1700 km/h on Earth. Wind can go in every direction, too.

The rotation of Earth has an influence on wind patterns via day/night cycles and the Coriolis force, but that's a more indirect effect.

Clouds move with the surrounding air so what applies to the atmosphere applies to them, too."
104,Does sequential hermaphroditism exist in humans?,"Only in the Navy.

Jokes aside, no. Humans do not organically change sex. Human embryos show very little sexual dimorphism, so some people joke (or erroneously believe) that everyone ""starts female,"" and artificial physical (and social) sex reassignment is used as a treatment for gender dysphoria, which is highly resistant to other forms of treatment. But nothing that would qualify as ""sequential hermaphroditism.""

Intersex people also do not gradually shift from one sex to the other organically. When ""hermaphroditism"" exists in humans, it is generally stable across time."
105,Does vellus hair on the body regulate body temperature?,"Hair will have many effects on the skin. Only from a mechanical perspective I can think of 3:

-if naked: increasing the surface where sweat can stick to, so increasing the maximum cooling capacity if sweating heavily. (Cooler feeling on the hairy side)

- if wearing clothes over the area: separating the clothes from the body and creating an air layer between the skin. Less heat transfer, hotter in cold weather. Colder in very hot weather. (Feeling better in the hairy side).

- if really hairy: creating a layer of air between the skin and the hair. Better in extreme conditions, hotter in mild conditions.

Will these differences overcome the tactile difference (how the clothes or the sweat feel on the skin)?? No idea.

I'd like to know if the skin biology is able to detect if the hair is there or it's shaved.

106,How accurate are spaghetti models?,"To start with, someone with more expertise in meteorology and/or weather forecasting (e.g., /u/wazoheat) will be better equipped to provide a complete answer. In simple terms though, ""spaghetti models"" effectively represent suites of different model results, typically where each path represents the simulated path of a storm from one run of one particular model given a particular set of starting conditions. Because of the dynamic nature of the atmosphere, even with nearly the same starting conditions, running a simulation multiple times will tend to give different answers (and that are more different the further into the future you consider), and this is effectively what you're seeing in ""spaghetti models"" (e.g., see this [FAQ entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/predict_weather/) for more a discussion of some of these dynamics and additional considerations as to why our predictions diverge after a few days into the future).

Returning to the question, from a simple perspective, when more of the paths overlap over some portion of the track, this reflects that more of the individual runs suggest effectively the same outcome (i.e., we have a higher confidence that the storm will move in that way). Typically, you'll see the most overlap in the areas reflecting forecast locations in the very near term (e.g., < 1-2 days out) and decreasing levels of overlap, and thus increasing uncertainty the further in the future. This is also what you see when instead of seeing ""spaghetti models"" you see a ""cone of uncertainty"" that widens further into the future, which you can kind of think of an average and standard deviation of the location predicted by different runs at different times. In terms of an actual probability that the true track looks like any particular path within the cloud of individual runs, that's harder to get at and will reflect both the quality/density of the observations available to feed into the model, the model itself, and the number of model scenarios run. It's not as simple as saying ""we ran 10 scenarios, so there's a 1 in 10 chance that it will look like one of these"" because there's no expectation that it has to behave exactly like any of the 10 scenarios. The more scenarios you're able to run, broadly the better you can estimate the path (and you would expect more of the models to converge toward something like what the actual path will be), but there as discussed above (and elaborated on in the linked FAQ), there is a level of chaos to weather systems that even if we were able to run a massive number of models, there would still be uncertainty in the short term that increases further out in time."

111,"How did the ancient astronomers, and Kepler specifically, translate the observed positions in earth’s heavens of the planets into a model of their orbits around the sun?","The really short answer: trigonometry.

The slightly longer answer: Detailed observations of the sun and planets' position in the sky, especially when compared against standard times of the year (say, the vernal equinox) or standard orientations relative to Earth (for Mars, say, ""opposition"" when the Earth was directly in between Mars and the Sun) allowed them to basically triangulate the position of the planets relative to the earth/sun system. Trigonometry was already widely used to make it possible to navigate ships by the positions of the stars, so as long as you had multiple detailed observations of a planet's position in the sky, a mathematician could work things out. There were also some ""lucky"" assumptions made...Kepler (and Brahe before him) inherited a lot of wrong ideas and assumptions from Ptolemy, Copernicus, and the ancient Greeks generally, and some of those wrong assumptions remained unchallenged for a long time...but either accidentally pointed them in a right direction anyway, or were within the margin of error that their instruments were then capable of detecting.

121,"If “dark matter” is a hypothesis, how can we know it has an effect on ordinary matter?","We know that something is having an effect on ordinary matter and ""dark matter"" is our best bet for what that is.

From astronomical observations we know roughly how much visible mass there is in various galaxies and other structures. Simply by measuring the amount of light emitted and fitting that to our models. But we can also observe how these structures interact with each other due to gravity.

And the gravitational interactions don't match up with the amount of mass we expect there to be. Not by a long shot. So there is either a lot more matter than we thought there would be. And that extra matter doesn't seem to affect the matter we do see in any way other than through gravity. Or our understanding of how gravity works is completely wrong.

While that second explanation might be more appealing than the notion that most of the mass in the universe is stuff we have never actually seen, there have been multiple different and independent observations, measuring different astronomical phenomena that agree with the hypothesis of the extra, unseen matter. And observations and experiments on a more local scale have shown that our understanding of gravity lines up very well with what we observe.

All these pieces of evidence suggest, but do not prove, the presence of a large amount of matter that is spread across galaxies and that doesn't interact with other matter in ways that we can measure right now except for its gravitational pull. Locally, near a dense object of regular matter, say near a star, the amount of this ""dark matter"" is so low that it can be ignored, but adding it all up across a galaxy, it adds a large amount of mass.

So far there's no direct evidence of dark matter. We've not seen the particles that make up this mysterious substance. We haven't even narrowed down the number of potential explanations of what it could be to a single one, which would greatly help the search.

But most physicists consider the hypothesis of dark matter to be very plausible and searches are underway for the particles that could make up this dark matter. Until we find something, it remains a hypothesis. But we do know that we're missing something, because what we calculate and what we measure does not agree."
122,Why do we get goosebumps on our arms but not no our hands or face?,"It's because what goosebumps physically are is tiny muscles called [arrector pili](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0276/6956/1483/files/why_goosebumps_occur_480x480.jpg?v=1660112947) around each hair follicle [contracting to make the follicle's hair stand up](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/PilioerectionAnimation.gif/220px-PilioerectionAnimation.gif) and stick out from the skin more.

This physical reaction evolved at a time when human ancestors had a lot more body hair, basically fur (think of cavemen).

* When you are cold, the evolutionary advantage of getting goosebumps is to puff up your body hair into an insulating layer that traps more air and keeps you warm better.
* When you are in emotion-driven goosebump situations (adrenaline, fear etc.) the evolutionary advantage is thought to be puffing up your hair to appear larger and more threatening as a form of protection. Lots of other mammals do this, such as cats' and dogs' hair standing up when they're angry or threatened and getting into a fight stance. The actual mechanism of their hair standing up is literally getting goosebumps on their skin. When a human gets goosebumps, their ""fur"" would be bristling like an angry cat's back.

So to answer the original question from the title, your hands or face don't get goosebumps because those regions don't have body-hair follicles (facial hair is a different type and its follicles don't respond the same way).

125,"Does vasoconstriction need the heart to pump harder in order to increase blood pressure? Or does it increase it on its own? If so, how?","Blood pressure is controlled by several factors including vasoconstriction and heart rate. Heart and blood vessel size both factor into your blood pressure but can act independently of each other. If your blood vessels constrict and HR remains the same, then your blood pressure increases. If you've ever been spraying a hose and then put your finger over the end of the hose so the water sprays out harder, that's a similar concept. The decreased size of the lumen (IE your finger over the hose) forces the same volume of fluid to go through a smaller space increasing the pressure. When your blood vessels constrict, the same volume of blood is forced to move through a smaller space which increases the pressure.

 If blood vessels dilate and HR stays the same, your blood pressure decreases. Once you start changing multiple parameters (eg vessel constriction and HR depression) then things get more complicated and you'll need more information to determine the outcome. 

In addition to HR and vessel size, stroke volume (the volume of blood that the heart pumps each time it contracts), pulmonary resistance (blood vessels in your lungs), viscosity, and anatomical differences can all affect blood pressure. Some diseases can also affect blood pressure like valvular disease (eg aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation), atherosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels due to plaque build up), Parkinson's disease (affects the autonomic nervous system that controls vessel size and heart dynamics), etc.

126,Why does sedimemt develop in hot water tanks?,"> heating water increases it's ability to dissolve things

Good news!  Today you get to learn about *[retrograde solubility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility#Temperature)*, or things that are less soluble when they get hot.

Ironically, the classic example of something less soluble when it gets hot is hard water or calcium salts.  These are the white spots you find on a glass shower screen.

Both calcium phosphate and sulfate precipitate out of water when they get hot.  They will form teeny tiny little microscope crystals which grow and grow.  

They can form on the walls of the pipe or tank, but they can also form on little chunks of dirt.  That makes the dirt heavier but also changes the charges on the surface (think of little positive and negative magnets ""growing"").  That growth will trap a lot of stuff in the tank.

Galvanic cells are another thing can form, which is why your hot water tank has a sacrificial anode.  There are tiny chunks of sediment and metal in the water.  It's not much, less than parts per million, but your tank goes through a huge quantity of water so over a year, yeah, you get enough metal or metallic-ish stuff that it forms a galvanic battery with the metal pipes/tank/valves.  You will start to get rust/corrosion in the tank.  Those particles of rust are electrostatically charged and they will precipitate out on the walls, or just plain old settle out into the bottom of the tank.

There is always that fun day when you turn on the water tap and some unexpected grey flakes are in the bottom of your jug. That's your sacrificial anode falling to bits.

The next fun bit is when you turn on the tap and the first flush is red coloured.  That's your tank rusting away and about to leak all over the floor."

Afaiu, the core could only become critical when enough neutron reflectors (the Beryllium half-spheres in the 2nd incident) surrounded the Plutonium and reflected enough neutrons back into the core to be able to trigger an uncontrolled chain reaction.

Leading up to the second incident they placed the Plutonium core in a Berrylium half-sphere, and they were fine. They placed the other Berrylyim half-sphere on top of it (by hand!) but kept a screwdriver wedged in to keep the top half from falling in all the way. More radiation was detected, but not enough to be dangerous. Still fine. Lowering the screwdriver started to close in the top over the Plutonium sphere, and they could measure the corresponding increase in radiation. So long as they didn't let it fall all the way on they were fine. Slotin had done this experiment a dozen times or so, and was (over)confident of his ability to do so safely. On the second incident, he got distracted and the  top Beryllium half-sphere fell all the way onto the bottom, sandwiching the screwdriver and completely enclosing the Plutonium sphere. Slotin immediately realized his error and moved the screwdriver to separate the two half spheres, but it was too late. This was enough coverage for the core to go critical, and Slotin got a dose of 1,000 rad (10 Gy) neutron radiation and 114 rad (1.14 Gy) gamma radiation in under a second, and died nine days later from acute radiation poisoning."

We have extraordinarily accurate orbit propagators (aka- software which takes a current location of an object in the Solar system and predicts where it will be in the future), which account for the locations of all of the planets as well. So, for instance, we track Mars' orbit, and Mars' orbit is affected by the locations of the other planets. If there was another planet somewhere, that we just didn't know about, our predictions would be wrong.

This isn't really new either. [It was the method we used to predict both Neptune and Pluto existsted](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/physics/astrocourses/ast201/pluto_tombaugh.html). Sure, with our more crude measurements back then, we were a little off (Pluto was originally predicted to be 11 times larger than Earth, for instance), but its location was predicted just by looking at how Neptune was orbiting- even though even since Neptune was discovered, ~~it still hasn't completed a single revolution around the Sun~~ it completed it's first full revolution around the Sun just in 2011. It just wasn't moving *quite* right.  

On a side note, I first realized how important this was early in my career when I got to use the orbit propagator used to plan the Apollo missions. To plan the burns to go from the Earth to the Moon, the propagator had to know the locations of several other planets (it didn't actually care about all of them- the effects were still there, but smaller than the best control we could have, so we didn't bother). So yes, even though the effect was small, we would get different answers based on whether or not Jupiter was near or far from us during the mission time.

**Edit:** was corrected below about Neptune completing an orbit. My learned in college fact is now outdated."
130,Will an object free falling from high in the atmosphere be displaced by Earth’s rotation?,"In that scenario, the most important thing would be the spaceship's speed as it entered the atmosphere. Typically spacecraft move much faster than the rotational speed of the planet beneath them.

For example, spacecraft in low Earth orbit (like the International Space Station) move at 8 km/s (about 5 miles per second) and travel around the world every 1.5 hours. Compare that to the Earth which turns every 24 hours: the ISS is 16 times faster.

Astronauts on board the ISS see 17 sunrises and 17 sunsets every day.

If the spaceship in your story was travelling from the night side to the day side, it's entirely possible to see the sun rise in a few minutes.

The case of the Red Bull guy is very different. He didn't start in orbit — he started approximately stationary with respect to the Earth's surface, which means he was already travelling east at the same speed as the Earth was rotating. As he fell, he continued to travel east at the same speed as the surface of the Earth, so from the point of view of someone on the ground he was falling approximately straight down.

I say ""approximately straight down"" because he would have landed slightly ~~west~~ (edit: east!) of where he started due to the Coriolis effect."
131,"I've seen people pushing the alkaline water BS lately, but it's got me thinking: what's the highest pH that's safe to drink?","You can get a lot of answers about the chemistry side here. Practically there will be a pH (hard to test for as you can imagine) that will burn your esophagus and melt it and you will die a gruesome death. Some people choose to commit suicide this way.

Below that pH you will get esophagus and sever (chemical) burns that make you wish you were dead. If you survive you will have horrible adhesions and strictures for the rest of your life and it will predispose you to esophageal cancer.

Below these pHs, you arelooking at neutralization of your gastric acid, which can lead to terrible infections. And if done consistently it changes your bloodstream pH and can cause some kidney issues with stone formation in the predisposed population.

Last but not least, below all that, probably not too much cuz it is a BS hype. Your kidneys and respiratory system keep tight control over your bloodstream pH. So these people give themselves minor indigestion for no real reason. And someone makes a lot of money off them."

133,how similar is the distribution of elements on the surfaces of Venus & Earth?,"The surface rocks themselves - well we only have broad compositions  from the Soviet Venera probes:

Venera 8 carried a gamma ray spectrometer to record flashes of light produced by gamma rays. The results were that the rocks at the landing spot contained 4%  potassium, 2.2 ppm uranium and 6.5 ppm thorium which is similar to granites here on Earth.

Veneras 9 and 10 sent still images from the surface of the Venus which geologist believe are weathered lavas similar to those found on Earth. A gamma ray density experiment suggested the rocks had a similar composition to basalt here on Earth. Both of their gamma ray spectrometers recorded potassium, uranium and thorium concentrations similar to Earthly basalts.

Although Veneras 11 and 12 carried soil measurement experiments, they both failed.

Veneras 13 and 14 used drills to penetrate the surface and then used X-ray fluorescence to measure the composition of the samples.

Venera 13 landed in an area of 'melanocratic alkaline gabbroid' which means an igneous rock originally formed at depth made up of various silicates such as pyroxenes rich in iron and magnesium as well as plagioclase feldspar which contains sodium, calcium and aluminium; with very little free silicon dioxide. The rocks at the site were comparatively potassium rich by comparison with similar rocks found here on Earth. 

Venera 14 landing spot was made up tholeiitic basalt very similar to the ocean floors on Earth which contains iron-rich pyroxene and olivine minerals, plagioclase feldspar and essentially  no free silicon dioxide.

Soviet scientists thought that Venera 13 had landed on a comparatively old piece of the Venusian crust that had been repeatedly folded and faulted whilst the Venera 14 site was much younger, perhaps only a few million years old."

135,How close to the North/South pole before a compass turns around?,"Traditional compasses function using the horizontal component of the magnetic field. When the intensity of the horizontal component drops below certain thresholds, it's no longer strong enough to really move a normal compass needle, or at least not strong enough to move it enough that it points toward the magnetic pole accurately. These zones of low intensity are referred to as ""blackout zones"" and the specification used in the [World Magnetic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Magnetic_Model) is that when the horizontal component intensity is less than 2000 nanoTeslas, this defines the ""unreliable zone"", i.e., where the compass reading will not be accurate. They also define a ""caution zone"" of between 2000-6000 nanoTeslas where accuracy may be degraded. If we look at maps of this for the [north](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/Polar%20Stereographic%20Arctic%20Main%20Field%20Declination%20%28D%29.pdf) and [south](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/Polar%20Stereographic%20Antarctic%20Main%20Field%20Declination%20%28D%29.pdf) poles, we can see two elliptical areas defining these two zones with the darker gray being the ""unreliable zone"" and the larger lighter gray being the ""caution zone"". You'll notice that these are (1) not circular (reflecting that magnetic field intensity is not a simple function of distance from the magnetic pole) and (2) not centered around the *geographic pole* (i.e., the rotational axis), but rather centered on the current (or recent) location of the *magnetic dip poles* (i.e., the location where the magnetic field orientation is vertical). For a discussion of the differences between geographic poles, magnetic dip poles, and geomagnetic poles, and a discussion of the variability of the location of magnetic dip poles, I'll refer interested readers to [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/mag_pole_types/)."
136,How does brain surgery change skull pressure? Would the pressure change by itself become dangerous in any way?,"Intracranial pressure can be changed by a mass, bleeding, or just general swelling in the brain. In the case of surgery, the increase in intracranial pressure will depend on a number of factors like location, type of surgery, etc. 

As for the pressure becoming dangerous, the answer is absolutely yes. Intracranial pressures have to be managed very carefully postoperatively. It could be alleviated by lowering systemic blood pressure, but if it is lowered too much, the blood won't perfuse through the brain because it won't overcome the higher pressure there. It could be alleviated (somewhat) with diuresis, or reducing total blood volume through increased urination. One of the more extreme interventions is to remove a section of the skull entirely, and leave a skin flap covering the brain.

Beyond the risk of hypo-perfusing the brain during a period of high intracranial pressure, one of the greatest lift threatening risks is brain herniation. If the pressures become great enough, the brain can be displaced and partially pushed through an opening in the skull. Typically, this would be the brain stem in the base of the skull herniating through the foramen magnum. However, herniations can also occur through other openings in the skull in the case of trauma or partial skull removal. 

On the other end of the spectrum, a loss of intracranial pressure, such as from a spinal tap that drains some amount of spinal fluid, will generally cause migraine symptoms (nausea/vomiting, light sensitivity, positional headache, etc). 

Hope that helps!"
137,Why are astronomical impact craters symmetrical without regard to angle?,"When an asteroid hits a large object the speeds are huge, for Earth 11km/s or higher.

138,Are there any plants or animals that can be found everywhere on earth?,"Generally yes. The cheeky answer is that your species fits this qualification pretty well.

Naturally there are some common sense caveats, like orcas are considered cosmopolitan but obviously stay in the oceans, as well as some insects but vice versa: they live only on land and have no marine presence, but the diversity of their range is great enough that we don't consider them sequestered in certain geographic areas or biomes based of evolutionary specialization."
139,"Presumably, having a higher sex drive has been an evolutionary trait that keeps homo sapiens surviving. Is there a known hoistoric species similar to homo sapiens, or an animal species, that died out due to a low sex drive leading to low reproduction?","Your presumption is incorrect, we in fact have very good reason to believe that human population growth has been limited by resource constraints and infant mortality far more than reproductive drive for at least the last 100,000 years, and you'll find this is true for many more complex animals due to our expensive and often helpless offspring. For a non-human analogy that illustrates this a little more clearly, consider the famous Finnish clutch size experiments in kestrals (Korpimäki et al, 1986 until the mid 90's). Researchers altered the clutch sizes of kestral parents by adding or removing eggs from nests, and measured the impact to overall reproductive success (ie offspring that survived to adulthood and successfully reproduced). Naturally, removing eggs led to a decreased number of offspring, even through those offspring were larger and more robust, but adding eggs increases the rate of starvation in both the chicks and the parents, decreasing overall fitness even more than removing eggs. So, while natural selection certainly operates on variation in reproductive success, the picture is far more complicated than simply the number of offspring you can put out irrespective of your own survival and ability to provide for them.

For an anthropological take, you could check out the many indigenous societies around the world which have diverse and elaborate cultural practices whose origins are myriad but whose overall effect is to reduce and stabilize population growth, generally by increasing the inter-birth interval and antagonizing sexual activity. If reproductive success is improved by way of decreasing fecundity, then that gives us the signal that something else is the limiting factor on reproduction and pumping out more kids is just going to make things harder for everyone."
140,Are humans meant to eat meat?,"Virtually every archaeological site with Paleolithic human remains also contains the remains of butchered prey animals, starting from small game and likely scavenging in the Lower Paleolithic and increasing in size and technological advancement until you get to the characteristically large ""Ice Age"" megafauna like mammoths and other large ungulates. There is also the fact that extinctions of Paleolithic megafauna follow the arrival of anatomically modern humans into every geographic region we made it to, virtually without exception.

The argument as to whether animal foods are, are not, or can be a part of a healthy diet is not really appropriate for this sub because it's such a hotly debated and, frankly, tribalistic topic. But our genus *Homo* spent millions of years adapting towards increasing reliance on predation and cooking, and anyone who disagrees with this has basically the entire field of paleoanthropology to contend with. It's not really a debated topic anymore. That isn't to say our lineage wasn't consuming plants, even the surviving hunter-gatherer populations which have typically been displaced into less hospitable environments by the agricultural world consume many plants species, so we generally consider that most Paleolithic humans had similarly diverse dietary makeups and the evidence is in line with that. Unfortunately, plant foods and evidence of their consumption are far less durable, so there is a clear preservation bias in evidence of Paleolithic diets, but the question here isn't ""did they eat plants"", it's ""did they eat meat"" and that answer is quite indisputably that they did."

Even while HLA testing was still the norm, the similarity of inherited antigens made it practically impossible to distinguish the paternity to a potential father from the father's close relatives, especially brothers. A single difference between the HLA sequences of a father and child would not rule out a positive test result for paternity, since these antigens are numerous and are inherited from both parents. We still use HLA testing today, for compatibility between organ and bone marrow donors and recipients."
143,Are the tectonic plates in different areas on the planet now compared to millions of years ago?,"Some of the more basic aspects underlying your question are covered in various bits of our (pretty extensive) set of [FAQs related to Plate Tectonics](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/#wiki_plate_tectonics_and_earth_structure) (e.g., general drivers and properties of plate motion). Two of your more specific questions are not directly addressed, so we'll touch on those:

**1.**  If the plates are constantly moving, does that mean they are in different locations now when compared to where they where millions of years ago?

**Yes, in both a relative and absolute sense.** What that statement means is that the plates are in different positions both *relative to each other*, e.g., individual plates have moved closer to, further away from, and/or changed their orientations with respect to each other between the past and present, but also *relative to a fixed reference frame* like the center of the Earth which we discuss as an absolute reference frame, e.g., if we hold latitude and longitude fixed with respect to the rotational axes of the Earth the position of any given spot on a tectonic plate has (generally) changed its coordinates through time reflecting absolute motion of that plate. Also of relevance, plates are changing shape through time as well as portions of given plates are subducted or underthrust, created at mid-ocean ridges, and/or captured by / loss to other plates. Similarly, new plates can form through a variety of means (see our FAQ for a discussion) and plates can be completely destroyed. As an example, [this visualization](https://portal.gplates.org/cesium/?view=AgeGrid) tracks plate boundaries (and extent/age of sea floor) for the last 230 million years (easier to see if you switch to the ""2D Map"" option in the upper right). In this, you can see that creation, destruction, change of shape, and translation/rotation of plates in both a relative and absolute sense.

**2.** Does the extent of mountain formation of two plates colliding cover more ground than the exact point of collision?

**Also yes.** Almost all plate boundaries are better described as zones. While for all of them, we can identify a single structure that represents the plate boundary in the sense of ""on this side is plate X and on this side is plate Y"", if we consider the *deformation* associated with the plate boundary and plate interaction, then it's almost never a single structure (and which structure represents that transition from plate X to plate Y can change through time, i.e., move within the zone of deformation). The width of the zone varies depending on plate boundary kinematics and type of lithosphere involved (generally). Divergent and transform boundaries between oceanic lithosphere (i.e., mid-ocean ridges or oceanic transforms) are very discrete and may be pretty close to a single fault. Divergent and transform boundaries between continental lithosphere are narrow, but will typically be a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide (e.g., the [East African Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift) or [San Andreas Fault System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault#Fault_zones), respectively). Convergent boundaries between oceanic lithosphere are again relatively narrow (at the surface), but can span 10s to 100s of kilometers (e.g., [accretionary wedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretionary_wedge)). 

Finally, most relevant to your question, convergent boundaries between continental lithosphere (or oceanic and continental) tend to be very diffuse, e.g., consider the width of the topographic expression of the Andes, Himalaya, Arabia-Eurasia collision, etc.). Some of this width reflects distributed deformation within one or both plates (e.g., the modern plate boundary between India-Eurasia is effectively at the southern edge of the Himalaya, but active deformation extends all the way to the northern margin of Tibet). Some of this width also reflects that what is simplified as a single plate for lay audiences is actually better considered to be broken up into many [minor or microplates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tectonic_plates). For example, the Greater Caucasus lie > 1000 km north of what's considered the modern Arabia-Eurasia plate boundary (i.e., the Bitlis-Zagros suture in southern Turkey and northern Iraq), but in reality, the area between the Bitlis-Zagros suture and the northern margin of the Greater Caucasus effectively represent a suite of microplates that are moving independently of both the main Arabian and Eurasian plates (e.g., [Reilinger et al., 2006](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JB004051)).

As a technical aside, the two options above also sort of represent two general end-member views of how continents deform (or how we can describe their deformation through time), specifically, is it better/more correct to consider discrete plate boundaries between large plates but where the edges of those plates deform broadly (i.e., a continuum model) OR to subdivide edges of plates into smaller largely independent plate like features (i.e., a microplate model) - or some combination of the two. This debate has been going on in the tectonics community for decades (e.g., [Thatcher, 1995](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB03064)). The extent to whether it's resolved (and the ""right"" answer) depends on who you ask (personally, I largely consider it a timescale issue, i.e., continuum models work better for long-term generalizations but microplate models are appropriate for shorter-term (few million years) generalizations)."
144,Why can't the wheels of EV cars charge up the battery while driving?,">  I'm sure I'm not the first person to think that 

True.

> so there must be a good reason,

There is.

> any ideas??

The first law of thermodynamics. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed. If you want to put energy into charging a battery, you have to remove that energy from somewhere. And that somewhere is the kinetic energy of the car. In other words: it's speed. And to make sure that the car doesn't slow down, the engine has to use additional energy. In an idealized scenario with no losses, the energy recovered to charge the battery would be exactly the same as the additional energy used to maintain the speed of the car. So you wouldn't gain anything.

But the reality is never ideal and we have to deal with losses in all steps of the process. Friction, charging inefficiencies, etc... So you would spend more energy maintaining the speed of the car than you'd recover with this system. Which mean that all it achieves is to drain the battery more quickly.

So that would make for a terrible system right?

Well, only if you leave it active all the time. Because there are moments when we don't mind our car slowing down. And that's when braking. So if we were to activate this energy recovery system only when braking, we recover some energy that can be used to charge the battery.

Such a system, also called ""regenerative braking"" is present in essentially all modern electric and hybrid-electric vehicles (in hybrid-electric cars that can't be plugged in it's even the only way to recharge the battery).

The added benefit of regenerative braking depends a lot on how you drive. An hour of highway driving at a constant speed will get you practically nothing. But in busy urban traffic you'll be doing a lot of slowing down, making the potential gains quite significant."

146,Do different positions around the globe have distinct and unique magnetic conditions? Could those be used in place of GPS? Would they at all impact native wildlife?,"> Do different positions around the globe have distinct and unique magnetic conditions?

Broadly, yes. The combination of differences in *declination*, i.e., the angle in a horizontal plane (i.e., tangential to the surface of the Earth in the given location) between a given location and the magnetic dip pole (see this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/mag_pole_types/) for a discussion of magnetic dip pole vs geomagnetic pole), *inclination*, i.e., the angle in a vertical plane (i.e., normal to the horizontal plane in which declination is measured) between a given location and the magnetic dip pole, and *magnetic field intensity* would be largely unique for any given place. For example, if we consider maps of [declination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Dcolourful.jpg), [inclination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Icolourful.jpg), and intensity (which we can break into [horizontal](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Hcolourful.jpg) and [vertical](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/Zcolourful.jpg) components), we can see that we can just measuring declination and inclination would probably give you a pretty exact location and if we added intensity, we could potentially increase precision and accuracy.

> Could those be used in place of GPS?

Technically, maybe yes, but it would be pretty annoying/challenging to do so. The first thing to consider that you would need pretty precise measurements of the inclination and declination of a location to distinguish it from nearby locations. From a practical standpoint, if we look at those maps from above, lines of constant declination and inclination (or intensity) are pretty 'wiggly' (for lack of a better term), and thus not nearly as intuitive as traditional coordinate systems that we use. I.e., it's pretty intuitive to understand what is implied by a difference in X degrees latitude or longitude (or X meters east or north in a projected coordinate system) and similarly mathematically simple to calculate distances between points in those coordinate systems, but less so if we were thinking about X degrees of magnetic inclination or magnetic declination because lines of constant inclination or declination are contorted.

 More problematically, because of [geomagnetic secular variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_secular_variation), for a given location, values of declination, inclination, and intensity change on relatively short timescales, e.g., maps of the rate of change of [declination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dDcolourful.jpg), [inclination](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dIcolourful.jpg), [horizontal intensity](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dHcolourful.jpg), or [vertical intensity](http://www.geomagnetism.bgs.ac.uk/images/igrf/dZcolourful.jpg) give you a sense that you'd be having to constantly adjust your coordinates for anything of moderate precision.

 Now, depending on the details of the traditional geographic coordinate systems used (and the locations considered), there is also ""drift"" in coordinates because of absolute and relative plate motions, but these are generally smaller rates of change and thus necessitate less frequent updates to coordinate systems than if we used a magnetic position/intensity based coordinate system."
147,How does sewing veins together work?,"We do artery-to-artery anastomoses as part of cerebrovascular bypasses for things like Moyamoya syndrome or large, untreatable aneurysms. We use suture that is finer than human hair by orders of magnitude and do it under extremely high magnification. Generally, you want to get about 6-8 sutures between the vessels, which are usually about 2-3mm in diameter. You’re looking for a water-tight anastomosis, which is usually completely possible if your suturing is on point. Then, the vessels heal themselves to each other relatively quickly, rendering your sutures unneeded. It’s extremely fine and meticulous work, but it’s certainly not out of the realm of possibility of human performance."

It is estimated that the blight killed between 3 and 4 billion American chestnut trees in the first half of the 20th century, beginning in 1904.[6][7][8] Very few mature specimens of the tree exist within its historical range, although many small shoots of the former live trees remain."

But I attended a talk from someone who worked on LIGO, just after the gravitational waves phenomenon it was built for. I remember they were talking about the insane precision of the instrument, since they needed such an order of magnitude of precision to measure gravitational waves. The mechanism that holds the mirrors and lasers in place has to be able to cancel out the vibrational energy from the crashing of the waves of the ocean on the Pacific shores, 500 km to the west. That vibrational noise, the waves from that were on the order of 10^-12 to 10^-15, and they needed upwards of 10^-22 of precision.

152,How do stars form compared to planets?,"The formation pathway for stars is the gravitational collapse of a [molecular cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud) via the [jeans instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans_instability). The cloud will be in [hydrostatic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium#:~:text=In%20fluid%20mechanics%2C%20hydrostatic%20equilibrium,by%20a%20pressure%2Dgradient%20force.) which is essentially that the desire for the cloud to collapse due to gravity is in balance with the gas pressure which holds it up. If there is a kick (perturbation) to the cloud then this can trigger a runaway collapse which will form one or many stars. There are many sources of kick to the system but one example is due to a nearby supernova.

&nbsp;


Unlike stars, which are born from molecular clouds, planets form from secondary accretion (primary being that which is related to the formation of the star) within a [protoplanetary disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk). At some point after the proto-star has formed there will be left over matter which does not fall into the star (essentially because when the star turns on it produces a thermal wind which inhibits accretion) and, for angular momentum conservation reasons, forms the protoplanetary disc around the star. There are two formation pathways for planets within a disk.

&nbsp;

The first is the bottom up accretion. Essentially, if you can clump together enough mass then its gravity will then attract more material and thus grow larger. Typically this method assumes that the initial mass is made up of ices which freeze out of the disk and clump together via collisions. Later, once they reach a large enough mass, they will rapidly accrete gas. It is thought that gas giants are the earliest formed planets in a system (also location location location is true for planets as the available mass for a planet within a protoplanetary disk is a function of the distance from the host star. Although migration is also important, but we will ignore this) and hence became the gravitationally dominant object within a large region of the disk.

Bottom up accretion is not fully understood (not that any of the other formation pathways for stars and planets are...) and as far as I am aware (it is not my field but closely related to it) we have not solved the coagulation problem. This is essentially that enough dust/grains need to accumulate to reach pebble size where run away accretion can occur. However, at small sizes grains often bounce or simply fragment when they collide rather than stick together. This does not invalidate the theory of accretion, just something we have to better understand through observation, models, and experiments.

&nbsp;

The second planet forming pathway is gravitational instability of the disk. This can only occur for the most massive protoplanetary disks and only very far from the host star. As such it is only really likely for high mass stars. Essentially the way it works is if the self gravity of a local patch of the disc becomes dominant over the gas pressure and differential rotation. The second part of this is worth mentioning more on. Protoplanetary disks are differentially rotating due to Keplers laws, so further out orbits slower than closer in. This produces a radial shear in the disk which is important because shear flows frequently become unstable/turbulent (e.g. [Kelvin-Helmholtz instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_instability)) and there are a whole zoo of disk instabilities ([magnetorotational instability (MRI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorotational_instability), [zombie vortex](https://www.eas-journal.org/articles/eas/abs/2019/01/eas1982038/eas1982038.html), etc.). This is not what the gravitational instability is, just an important aside as it means that protoplanetary disks are turbulent fluids. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_JgwlWDL3aw) is a nice video of what the gravitational instability looks like. You can see at the outer regions of the disk bright patches which could become planets. Although it should be noted that it is unlikely a disk would be this efficient at planet formation.

It is worth noting that the gravitational instability can only form very massive planets and low mass brown dwarfs. It has also never really been observationally confirmed as a gas giant will look the same from the outside by either pathway. However, the inside will be very different. Regular accretion will result in more dense ices in the central core of the planet (which may or may not be discrete, for example Jupiter has a mushy core) while one formed from gravitational instability will be more homogeneous throughout.

153,"At what point is an invasive species no longer considered invasive and is considered part if the local biome, or does that never happen?","European starlings have been in North America for over a hundred years. They're everywhere, but they're still considered invasive.  Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have been in North America for ~500 years, and are still considered invasive by many. 

This might be more of a history question - species may not be considered invasive if they invaded prior to our knowledge or written history."
154,How do you find the habitable zone of a star?,"The current standard is in [this paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab8fa/meta); it talks mostly about the outer limit with a methane greenhouse but the formulas in section 3.2 also include the most up-to-date numbers for a CO2 greenhouse, which is what ""habitable zone"" usually refers to. The inputs are star luminosity and effective temperature. As you can perhaps tell by the fact that there are several different boundaries there, these shouldn't be taken as strict boundaries, and the nature of the planet itself can also have a significant influence."
155,Can someone explain dating methods (in books-for-dummy’s) style between common modern methods such as carbon dating to radiometric?,"Carbon dating is a form of radiometric dating. ""Radiometric"" pretty much just means ""measuring using radiation"".

All radiometric dating works the same way. At a basic level, you just look at the amount of a certain radioactive isotope in an object and use the known half-life to work out how long it's been there.

This only works in situations where the supply of radioactive material is cycled through and kept relatively constant. When the cycle stops, you don't get any new radioactive material coming in, so it just sits and decays.

Using carbon dating as an example: most carbon is carbon-12, which is stable. But about one carbon atom in every trillion is carbon-14. While an animal is alive they're constantly eating and breathing and absorbing new carbon to replace what they lose in waste products, so the amount of carbon-14 in the animal stays about equal with the overall amount of carbon-14 in the world. But when they're dead they don't eat or poop as much, so the carbon that's in their body stays there - including the carbon-14.

Half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of an amount of radioactive material to decay into something else. Carbon-14 has a half-life of 5730 years, thereabouts. So if you stumble upon this dead animal and you notice that only one in every two trillion atoms of carbon are carbon-14, well it's a pretty good guess that it used to be one in every trillion but now the amount has been halved, meaning it's been about a half-life since the animal stopped taking in new carbon. So you can wager that it died about 5730 years ago.

You can do this quite far back. If you're down to one in every four trillion, it's been halved and halved again, so two half-lives, or 11460 years ago. You can keep going down and down, getting smaller and smaller fractions and working out how many half-lives you'd need to get there. The limit is how accurately you can measure how much carbon-14 there is.

So to get around this precision problem, if we need to look further back, we use isotopes with longer half-lives so that the amounts are bigger and easier to measure. Uranium-235 and potassium-40 are common ones. It's not even really multiple methods when you use different isotopes like this for radiometric dating, it's one method with a different lenses.

In general you'll also want to try with a bunch of different isotopes and cross-reference the dates with each other to get a more precise answer. If your carbon dating says it was 15,000 years ago and potassium dating says it was 15,100 years ago, you've got a pretty good ballpark estimate.

It's important to note that precision is limited because of how random radioactive decay is. You can never place it exactly, but you can get to within a pretty small fraction of a half-life, usually a decade or two. Which on the grand scale of history is approximately the blink of an eye."
156,Why European Apes(Dtyopithecini) does not survived in Europe and died out around ?,"The Wikipedia site for the genus Dryopithecus says that changing climate and the associated decline of warm - climate forests might have been the reason.

157,"Can inbred genes be ""fixed"" by stopping inbreeding and starting breeding outside of the gene pool?","It's important to recognize that the ""badness"" of an allele is nothing inherent about it's actual nucleotide sequence, but rather the effect it has on fitness. This might sound pedantic but it's important to recognize because the next step in understanding this is to consider that inbreeding does not and fundamentally cannot *create* bad (aka ""deleterious"") genes. Only mutation can do that, and mutation is random in its occurrence and its distribution in the genome. Therefore, we don't consider known deleterious alleles to be ""inbred genes"", since they arise from mutation no different than any other allele. And since we already know that deleterious genes will (by definition) face selection pressure which reduces their frequency in the population, we see that the force that reduce deleterious alleles in an inbreeding population is exactly the same as the one that reduces them in a non-inbreeding population: natural selection. It is also important to note that populations in many species are heavily inbred with no clear detrimental trends to their fitness.

So, how do these facts all coexist? The answer is that inbreeding can only alter the expression of deleterious alleles which are already in the population, and generally only those that are recessive. In a larger, non-inbred population, there are typically a strong majority of people who do not carry these hypothetical recessive alleles, and so their dominant alleles almost always silence the expression of the deleterious ones for heterozygote carriers. As you decrease the supply of these dominant alleles (usually via cultural behavior like restricting marriages to kin groups), you increase the likelihood that two parents will both be heterozygous carriers of a given recessive allele and produce a homozygous child who expresses the disease. The degree to which this impacts the fitness of that child is of course based on the severity of the disease and how it affects reproduction, but in human societies we sometimes do strange things like effectively cultivating inbred lineages and populations based on wealth, social hierarchies, and out-group exclusion. If a previously inbred population with a trend of recessive genetic disease is suddenly exposed to a larger, non-inbred reproductive pool of partners, you will see those deleterious alleles decrease in frequency commensurate with the magnitude of their impact to fitness. This magnitude reaches its apex in diseases which render the expressing individual sterile, since obviously that lineage is effectively extinct.

There is also the role of a concept called antagonistic pleiotropy, which is where a given allele can have a beneficial effect at one point in the lifespan, but a detrimental effect somewhere else. For example, if we imagine some recessive genetic disease which perhaps makes you resilient to influenza during childhood, but causes severe (or even fatal) respiratory disease in your 40's and onward, this could potentially calculate out to a strong selective advantage because reproduction in the fifth decades and onwards is rare for most humans, whereas infant mortality from infectious disease was almost universally rampant among human populations up until just a few decades ago. In this way, genetic disease can persist in populations because it presents a benefit to fitness at some point in the life history of the carrier which outweighs its cost, and this can even happen across different lifespans in a lineage. Sickle-cell anemia is the classic example of the latter scenario: it is a severely deleterious allele when two of them end up in the same person, but this happens uncommonly enough that the benefit it presents to heterozygotes (substantial resistance to malaria) in the same population outweigh the detriment to these individuals who sadly express the disease."

160,Where does rain in the Midwest USA come from?,"Most comes from the west without having fallen yet in more western locations. Some comes north from the Gulf Of Mexico. Less than that comes south from the Arctic Ocean including Hudson Bay.

Both of those are more common in more eastern locations, but also, the more eastern your location is, the more often you also get water from the Atlantic Ocean, following a clockwise path: first west/northwest/north from the ocean onto the continent, then northeast/east from the continent back out to the ocean.

The jet stream is not the only major air current in this picture. The northward & clockwise movements sometimes coming from the Gulf Of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean are influenced by a southern band of flow, like the jet stream but going the opposite way, called the ""trade winds"". The interaction between that and the jet stream causes large systems to move in paths that keep steering to the right (clockwise). This is also why hurricanes generally hit the Carribean islands first, then hit the southeastern USA, then sometimes turn north along the continent's eastern region, before going back out to sea far north of where they came from.

I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Predicting the weather was practically always a matter of watching what was happening to the west and expecting it to be over us 1-3 days later, but our biggest storms were always when there was something coming from the west combined with something from the GOM arriving at the same time."

162,"'Pound for pound,' do young trees scrub more or less CO2 from the atmosphere than a single, large, older tree?","Considering that large older tree is possibly part of a forest ecosystem, the answer is not quite as simple as looking at just the trees. A forest is so much more than just trees with intricate webs of nutrient cycling in and between all its organisms (shrubs, understory plants, mosses, lichens, soil fauna, microbes, etc), and carbon is stored in the soil as well. The soil will also be prone to decomposition and carbon might be released to the atmosphere, due to changes in ground surface temperature, water availability, aeration of the top soil. The degree of decomposition following tree harvest is largely dependent on the degree of disturbance, i.e. the harvesting/ground preparation methods.

If this single tree was standing alone in somebody's yard, the disturbance to the ecosystem might not be as drastic, but that tree would have likely still kept the surface around it cool, and the roots would be left to decompose.

Another point to consider is the location/ecosystem where new tree is being planted. While forests do store large amounts of carbon, some ecosystems, e.g. mires, lose carbon when planted with trees, due to disturbance in their hydrologic regimes as well as chemical and microbial composition of the soil.

If you just look at cutting and conserving a single isolated large tree and planting a new tree, then yes, the younger tree will bind more new CO2 over it's lifetime than the older tree would during that same period. But nature is rarely that simple."
163,"If a woman with Swyer syndrome (XY chromosomes) had a child with an average man (also XY chromosomes), could the child have YY chromosmes?","No. X and Y are not mirror images of each other, the X chromosome is comparable in size to the larger autosomes and has around a twelve hundred genes, all of which are essential for life. The Y chromosome has a tiny amount of genes which are seemingly only involved in male sex determination and development. Roughly half the population lives perfectly fine without Y chromosomes, whereas not a single human being has ever been documented without an X chromosome, so a YY karyotype would be incompatible with life."
164,Can you get electrocuted by putting a fork into a USB port?,"While a USB port technically can deliver enough current to give a lethal shock, it is only 5 volts and it would be difficult to contrive a situation where your body resistance was low enough for a 5V source to push lethal current through you.  I semi-frequently touch 24VAC wires connected to a 100VA source and unless I'm a bit sweaty I won't even get a tickle sensation.

Less than 30 volts is generally not considered a lethal risk.

It's not literally impossible but it's very unlikely unless there is also a component failure causing the USB port to have much more voltage on it than should be there.  A short to the source power, for example.

Still, don't stick forks in electrical things."
165,Why are fog lights yellow?,"Because an analysis by some French researchers in the 30s about the appropriate color for fog lights erroneously used the Rayleigh model to determine yellow worked better than white.  Yellow became popular for fog lights.  Now of course we know that the Wei model is appropriate for fog, and the Rayleigh model is not.  According to the Wei model both white and yellow work equally.  Now white is more popular than yellow For fog lights."
166,How does remote sensing of soil moisture work?,"Globally this stuff is done using satellites. Now, there are two general categories on how to do this. Passive and active remote sensing.


**Passive** remote sensing of soil moisture simply involves measuring the brightness temperature using satellites. Basically, the satellites have microwave cameras and based one the amount of microwave light received you can measure temperature within the wavelengths band your sensor can measure, based on black (or grey) body radiation. You then need to come up with a model that can turn the measured radiation into the moisture content. This generally involves two steps. You need a radiative transfer model, that deals with the interaction (absorption, reflection, scattering) in the atmosphere and a dielectric mixing model. The water in the soil will affect the emissivity and dielectric constant, so with these model you can invert them (i.e. see the inverse problem) to get the moisture content from your satellite measurements.

**Active** microwaves send pulses of microwaves which are reflected back by the soil. Water strongly interacts with the microwaves (i.e. that's why microwave ovens work) so the moisture content in the soil will change how the signal is reflected. You again need to come up with some inverse model to retrieve the soil moisture. 

It is important to remember that any measurement has errors. So, to get more accurate estimates you can combine different measurements, i.e. use multiple wavelength bands and both active and passive remote sensing. For example, least squares methods can be used to combine the different measurements.

167,Does exercise make medicines carried in the blood work faster/more effectively?,"Aerobic exercise can change the *pharmacokinetics* of some medications.  

* some work faster, some slower (intensity changes)

Heart failure drug *digoxin* decreases concentration in the blood but increases concentration in skeletal muscle (FYI turns it into a slow release drug, which can be good or bad on the circumstances).

[Blood thinner *warfarin*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4735233/) reduces concentration in the blood and patients that are known heavy exercisers require higher dosages (and the opposite for sedentary patients).

168,Does the transfusion of young blood for rejuvenation in humans have any scientific backing?,"There are serious ethical concerns involved to these questions. Most likely because the initial blood rejuvenation in mice wasn't objected by means of blood transfusion - their circulatory systems has been fully joined (parabiosis).

In addition to that - an significant percentage of mice in parabiosis died quickly - for reasons the scientists could not explain.

Thus, the initial assumption of rejuvenation effects in mice is already questionable, at least by the means of parabiosis. It may be the foundation of the assumption that rejuvenation effects could be achieved my means of blood transfusion. But this couldn't be objected in reviews of studies on the effects of young donor blood in whole blood transfusions. Those showed either no effect at all, or in contrast to assumed rejuvenation, that the risk of death for recipients of young donor blood is slightly increased."
169,"Ask Anything Wednesday - Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science","Question:

Let say 6 people are placed 100 miles above the earth surface, one at each pole, and the other 4 equidistant around the equator.  We tend to think gravity pulls them toward the earth.  But I've been told that that it is the warping of spacetime that actually warps the larger mass towards them.  If that is true, it seems the earth and maybe everything with mass is expanding?

Unless something is pulling those 6 people towards the larger mass, how can the mass eventually crash into all 6 who are all in different directions?  Am I wrong is something pulling them?  Or is the larger mass pushing toward them?"
170,"If we have the human genome mapped, do we know what each gene does?","Some stuff to pick apart here.

First, the vast majority of genes in the human genome (and probably all eukaryotes) do not code for any proteins. In humans, about 1.5-1.6% of the total genetic sequence is composed of genes which produce actual proteins.  We split up the non-coding regions into a few categories and some that do have other functions, but it is complex and much of it is hotly debates and/or poorly documented. Just last year a project called the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium led by Karen Miga at UC Santa Cruz published the most complete human genome sequence ever, adding 99 identified coding genes and a couple thousand candidates to be further studied.

But, as you can probably guess, knowing that a gene produces an mRNA transcript and eventually a protein is like 1% of the entire picture. You then have to trace that protein through the biological context and see where it goes and what it does, which is nightmarishly complex. Even for the most well-studied genes that produce the biochemical molecules of apex importance like dopamine, insulin, ferritin, etc, we are finding new places where they exert influence all the time.

Regarding the CRISPR and AI stuff, I'm not an expert in those areas so I can't comment with any confidence, but I would strongly suggest that there's quite a lot of hype and poor understanding of both of those things in the public space. For example, CRISPR only works on cells that literally in the midst of a certain phase of mitosis, which makes it a pretty poor candidate for tissue-scale gene therapy. With regard to the anti-aging stuff, it's not at all a consensus that things like grey hair and eye aging are the result of genetic changes which could be reversed with gene therapy. Further, thinks like skeletal development are certainly strongly influenced by the genome (sometimes even deterministic), but they are also following a developmental trajectory through time which is generally solidified against further changes. Lastly, the human genome (like all genomes) is a complex and immensely interconnected network, and haphazardly pulling levers to try and crank a certain trait up or down is almost guaranteed to cause harmful side effects."
171,How does the body filter which liquids go into the body and which liquids turn into pee?,"It all goes into your blood, and your kidneys are responsible for filtering out excess water to your bladder.

Urine is used to flush out various toxins from your body, so you need to drink enough water that at least some gets filtered out. The more you drink, the more water gets filtered out and the more dilute the urine will be."
172,Why did it take so long to discover the Kuiper Belt?,"Small, distant from the sun, not very reflective and no one was really looking for them. Pluto and Eris the largest Kuiper belt objects are only 2,376.6 and 2326 km in diameter. Things much further away tend to be much larger.  Most the other objects are also stars or made of stars which shine with their own light not the reflected light of Kuiper Belt objects. While some stars are smaller that light generation make a vast difference. Many of those further away things are entire galaxies of star hundreds of thousands of light years in diameter. 

After the discovery of Pluto we essentially stopped looking in that area for objects and the ones that existed were small and faint enough to avoid accidently discovery. Having large telescopes with plenty of time to image them was required.  Taking multiple phots of a single area and comparing them was required, and because of how slow they apparently move those photos need to be separated in time by quite a lot to see the motion. With film this was highly impractical. Only after CCDs came to be the primary method of astronomical imaging did it before more practical to attempt.  By 1992 there were more large telescopes and they were using electronic imaging and someone cared to look. Few professionals with access to those large telescopes had gone into minor object discovery because there was no place for them to work and no work being done. Even when we started looking it took [David C. Jewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_C._Jewitt) and his team 5 years to find the first one."
173,Is clear ice always pure water?,"Ice could be completely clear and still be full of lethally toxic levels of clear poison for example.  The ice in the ice machine is made from water from the tap, and freezing it does not do anything to anything that might be in the water.  Being clear is no indication of anything other than not having suspended solids in it. 

Surely the water from the tap that you strangely then distill is also clear before you distill it? 

Having said that, if you live in a first world country then it's still all fine, but you probably know that since you describe yourself as being weird about drinking water.    Why don't you just get a water filter?"
174,"I keep reading comparisons of todays weather to previous time periods, where it says that its the hottest month since some years ago. So was it just as hot or hotter before? If global warming is the cause today, what caused it to be that hot a 100 years ago? Why is today so much worse?","When you read that July 2023 has been the hottest month of July since measurements began in 1880, it doesn't mean July 1880 was remotely as warm as July 2023. It means that we were not measuring temperature everywhere systematically before 1880, so we don't have the data before that, that's it.

So we have to use other methods to go further back in time. Some model may be used to model historical climate and say that the hottest day this year was hotter than any other day in the past 100,000 years. Again, this is due to the limits of the model that was used, it cannot go back in time further than that. It doesn't mean that 100,000 years ago there was a super hot day...

That's it really. Unless you go back in time far enough to reach a point at which the poles had a tropical climate, millions of years ago. But plants and animals were completely different back then, so it doesn't tell us much about our possible survival.

175,Do species ever evolve themselves into a corner over time and go extinct because of that rather than environmental change?,"Evolutionary suicide or runaway evolution is a theory that exists.

For example, individuals might be selected to destroy own food (e.g. switch from eating mature plants to seedlings), and thereby deplete their food plant's population.

[*Parthenogensis* (e.g. asexual reproduction or self-cloning) has been linked to extinction events](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113917/#:~:text=Parthenogenesis%20is%20ecologically%20advantageous%20in,rates%20of%20reversal%20or%20both.).  It seems like it should be more popular but is relatively rare, because it is not long term sustainable.  A species of lizard can reproduce either sexually or asexually.  There is a short-term population explosion from the asexual group, they outcompete the sexual group, expand beyond their normal range, eat all the food and then go extinct.

> The relatively young age and small number of parthenogenetic vertebrate species suggest that asexuality is evolutionarily disadvantageous in the long term.

The other examples of self-destructive traits are linked to effect that are frequently gained and lost, or the trait is reversible.  Examples include salt tolerance (increased extinction rates or high trait reversal) and self-pollination in plants (high trait reversal) and colour polymorphism in birds (increased extinction rates)."
176,Is there any working theory of what preceded the Big Bang?,"One theory championed by Roger Penrose is called the [cyclic conformal cosmology ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology), where the universe is technically infinite in both past and future.

Essentially the idea is that as the universe expands, well eventually reach a point where everything is so spread apart that the universe is basically empty. Penrose argues that there's actually a certain kind of equivalency between this infinitely spread out state and the state of the Big Bang.

Essentially the idea is we go through a cycle of Big Bang followed by expansion until everything is fully spread out, at which point another big bang happens, and the cycle repeats.

The wiki article explains thing far better than I ever could, although it is technical. Still, it's a fascinating idea from a truly incredible man. Even if he's ultimately wrong, it's a really interesting concept.

Oh, there are also some YouTube videos out there. [PBS SpaceTime](https://youtu.be/PC2JOQ7z5L0) covered the idea in a pretty accessible way. [the IAI](https://youtu.be/ftjwnjR0apY) has a slightly longer lecture by Penrose himself talking about the idea for a general audience (it's somewhat more technical than the PBS video, but still quite accessible)."
177,"How did increasing brain size (or rather genes for a large brain/higher complexity/intelligence) of human ancestors get ""selected"" over time?","Why would an early hominin with a larger brain be at greater risk of predation?

It is important to not conceive of every trait as arising from a single gene with a single, clear cut positive or negative contribution to fitness. For example, a large brain requires a large cranium, which is exquisitely dangerous to the hypothetical mother going through delivery, and yet clearly it is the case that it was strongly advantageous across millions of years of hominin evolution. You'll find that many, if not most, evolutionary trends like these are a mixed bag of tradeoffs in already highly complex animal biology. Whether they persist and approach fixation depends on the rest of the selective landscape. In the case of our lineage and it's shifting environmental experience, a large brain clearly paid for whatever negative costs it imposed on the individuals along that evolutionary trend.

It's also important to note that not all traits have an adaptive history, and its easy to run afoul of what we call ""just so"" stories, which is basically inventing adaptive histories for any conceivable ""trait"" without any good evidence to support that they *actually* occurred and aren't just plausible explanations. Of course, hominin brain size is certainly not an example of a randomly produced trait without any contribution to fitness (called a spandrel), but it's good to remember that these exist so you can temper the need to find clear cut adaptive histories for every trait with the understanding that evolution is really a landscape of shifting pressures and environmental experiences rather than big, discrete arrows pushing some trait in a given direction."
178,Is there any way to estimate the age of Sag A*?,"it's very hard to estimate the age of these massive objects, because we don't exactly know the mechanisms of how these forms. Do they form when the first galaxies are created and then merged? Or do clouds of hydrogen gas collapse into seed blackholes? Or are there new physics to accelerate the collapse of these objects in the beginning?

The best way to estimate this is probably just infer from the age of the Milky Way, this is done via more complicated steller dynamics that I'm not familiar with (paper: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04496-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04496-5)). The answer is that it's almost as old as the Universe itself, probably close to 13.6 billion years.

Another other way to estimate the age of our black hole is probably to try to go outside of our galaxy to see the oldest / farthest supermassive black holes and then maybe extrapolate ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03179](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03179)). Although these are super bright quasars that aren't exactly the same as Sag A\*, and the fact they need to be bright means that galaxies have formed around them, so the numbers probably won't differ very much from just the age of Milky Way. This also gives something like 13 billion years."
179,"Is heat death the ultimate end of the universe or are there any other theories that are more ""likely""?","The other likely ""end"" was that gravity overcomes expansion and everything eventually crushes back down into a single point:  The Big Crunch.  More recent observations of timespace expansion have made the general consensus see this as less likely than heat death, but it's still possible.

If it makes you feel better, both possibilities involve you not existing long before either happens."
180,Is it possible for relative velocity to exceed the speed of light?,"Whenever asking or answering a question about relativistic speeds, you always have to include one last piece of information- from who's perspective?

So, let's say there's two people on rocket ships, Alice and Bob, and Eve is on a planet watching them. If, as measured by Eve, Alice and Bob both accelerate to 55% the speed of light and fly right at each other, then as measured by Eve, Alice and Bob will have a closing velocity of 110% of the speed of light. And that's OK. Eve is measuring two objects, both are moving less than 'c' and everything is fine.

But what does Alice see? Well, let's skip the acceleration portion, and get to the point were Alice and Bob have finished accelerating (special relativity with accelerating reference frames is really hard). In this frame, Alice is ""stationary"" (she's not accelerating, so it's an inertial frame), then Alice will see Bob moving towards her at [0.844c](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=velocity+addition+0.55c+%2B+0.55c&assumption=%7B%22FS%22%7D+-%3E+%7B%7B%22VelocityAdditionRelativistic%22%2C+%22V%22%7D%7D&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22VelocityAdditionRelativistic%22%2C+%22u%22%7D+-%3E%220.55+c%22&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22VelocityAdditionRelativistic%22%2C+%22vprime%22%7D+-%3E%220.55+c%22). Now, some people will say ""it's because in special relativity velocities don't add and you have to use the [velocity addition formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula)"" but I find that answer to be a little unsatisfying. While it's true, the velocity addition formula is what you use to solve it, where does it come from?

It comes from the facts of [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) and it's for some reason less popular cousin of [length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction). Time contraction says Eve will see Alice's clocks running slowly (Alice will of course see her clocks running at just the right speed), and length contraction (which is just as fundamental, but doesn't seem talked about as much), says Eve will measure further distances between objects than Alice will. So, both of these things will lead to Alice measuring a slower velocity for Bob, and if you combine both of these effects, you will end up with the velocity addition formula."
181,What are the names of the forces holding wet clay so that it can me molded and holds shape?,"Capillary forces. The strong interfacial attraction between the water and the clay, the water surface tension and the small distances between the clay particles all lead to capillary forces which push/ pull the particles together.

Essentially, the water wets the clay surfaces due to favorable clay-water interactions. When the particles are close enough, water forms curved water-air interfaces bridging between the particles. These are always curved concave into the water phase because of the favorable clay-water interactions. These curved interfaces lead to a lower pressure inside the bridges between the particles and so the particles are pushed together.

You need the water-air interface. Note that when you saturate the clay with water (no more air) it loses its strength.

Edit: spelling"
182,How do we know that the sun has burned half of its fuel?,"The sun does convert mass into energy, but it is a really small fraction of its mass.

What it is really doing is fusing hydrogen into helium (which does destroy a tiny bit of mass and turn it into energy). It will also fuse helium into other elements at a much lower rate.

So astronomers can look at what the sun is made of now, estimate what gasses and dusts would have come together to form it, and look at the differences in composition to see how much it has already fused."
183,Are there any pre-industrial cases of solar power that didn't involve combustion?,"[Pliny the Elder](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D37%3Achapter%3D10) wrote about intrepid Romans mining giant natural crystal from the Alps while suspended on a rope, then polishing it into a lens, then using focused sunlight to cauterize wounds and light fires. 

It is unclear if Archimedes really used solar power as a weapon against the Roman Navy, but he would have understood enough optics to try. Imaginative recreations have lit mockup Roman warships on fire provided the enemy is covered in flammable pitch and chooses to cooperate by holding still close to shore."
184,"In materials science, are strength and other properties also calculated at the atomic level?","The challenge is that the relationships between the atomic level and macroscale properties are complex. Take your example of yield strength for instance. For a pure metal (to keep things simple), it is not so difficult to calculate the stress necessary to displace a layer of atomic bonds. But if you do this calculation, you'll find that it dramatically over predicts strength. 

In fact this exact observation led to the theoretical development, and later direct experimental observation, that crystals deform by [dislocations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation). The subfield of materials science related to mechanical behavior is now largely the study of dislocation motion, and strength in a crystal goes up if things block them (like precipitates or even other dislocations, which is essentially what work hardening is).

So you can see that it isn't about understanding just an atomic interaction, but about the collective behavior of a very large number of atoms. This behavior tells us a lot about how a material performs and lets us design better ones, and because of this materials scientists are constantly studying these atomic interactions. But it is very challenging to go directly from atoms to macroscale properties even in simple cases. So often, the most direct way to get useful information is just to measure it at the macroscale directly."

186,How do we know about Milky way?,"You're right, we don't have any actual pictures of the Milky Way. We're inside it, and nothing we've ever sent into space has ever come anywhere close to leaving it. So any ""picture"" of the Milky Way you have seen is a model or illustration. Basically we can look out from inside it in all different directions and measure what all the features are and how far away each one is, and in which direction. From combining these observations you can model what the whole thing must look like if *could* see the whole galaxy at once from outside of it.

Note that that means these ""pictures"" are not exact, and may be missing features that are distant and have been blocked from our lines of sight from here."
187,Are there any other species of homo alive today besides sapiens?,"Probably not.  Otherwise we would have seen genetic variations consistent with intermingling in DNA checks when they happen.  Otherwise, we would find places that run afoul of infertility to where we would check what’s up only to find genetic differences.

There may be more genetic remnants in isolated and protected populations of people, but it would still be very unlikely.

Humans are everywhere, and our genome is consistent enough that a species difference would be easy to spot from phenotype or genotype."
188,"If the stars and galaxies are pictures from the past (because of their distance,) can we tell by their shape and brightness and other properties if they are still there or have transformed into other stellar objects? What are some examples? Thanks.","If a star is 10 million light years away from us, then we can only know what that star was like 10 million years ago. The only information we get from stars is light, so all of our information is 10 million years old. We can try to guess what the star is like by categorizing into a class with other similar stars, but we can only know for sure what the star was like 10 million years ago."
189,How do we know and have a picture of Milky Way galaxy if we're in it? And who took the picture?,"You're right, we don't have any actual pictures of the Milky Way.

For example things that are on the far side of the galactic core from our point of view. The core is too dense and bright to look through and see all the details of the faint edges on the opposite side from us. So we just look at the side we can see, and out at other galaxies similar to ours, and estimate what the far side of ours looks like for the sake of any rendering or model of ""The Milky Way"" that you've seen."
190,How does the sperm DNA gets shuffled ?,"Chromosomal rearrangement, also known as DNA crossover, occurs during Meiosis I. During the first phase of meiosis, the chromosomes line up in pairs, since there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells. Before the chromosomes separate, corresponding sections of the chromosomes can switch, or cross over, between the pair. This process occurs with the help of enzymes called recombinases. The rearrangement of the genetic material in the reproductive cells leads to genetic diversity, since the child will not inherit an exact copy of the parent’s genetic material. Copied from: https://sciencing.com/rearrangement-meiosis-21044.html"
191,Rivers form as freshwater moves from a higher elevation to a lower elevation. How come we don't see rivers that haven't reached the ocean yet?,"For the quick way of interpreting your question, [endorheic basins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin), i.e., internally drained watersheds where rivers flow into lakes instead of the ocean, are definitely a thing.

Another way to interpret your question is ""Why don't we see 'in progress' rivers where a river forms and starts flowing toward the ocean but hasn't reached it yet?"" The short version is that (1) it requires a *very low* slope for water to start flowing, (2) once water starts to flow on an erodible substrate (i.e., soil, regolith, rock), it starts to channelize pretty quickly, (3) the timescale for growing topography is *much longer* than the timescale for a channel to begin to form, and (4) even in the event of a ""new"" river forming somewhere on growing topography, it's not as though this river will chart a new course to the ocean, it will flow downhill always effectively toward the lowest local point (and so on until it reaches *baselevel* whether that's the ocean or an internally drained lake) and almost always, flowing toward the local lowest point means this ""new"" river will connect to an existing river system *long* before it reaches the ocean. Thus, when we think about new topography forming, we pretty much always think about it forcing a *drainage reorganization*, i.e., it reorders existing river networks to reflect the new way water flows, but mostly in the area with new topography (though there can be downstream effects, depending on the details).

Finally, we do kind of see rivers where the water doesn't always reach the ocean but sometimes does. Specifically an [ephemeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River#Permanence_of_flow:_perennial_and_ephemeral) river is one where the channel exists, but water continuously flowing in it does not, usually because the catchment for this river is in an arid location and only sporadically or seasonally receives enough precipitation for their to be runoff and channelized flow in the river. In an ephemeral river, it's definitely possible for the channel to be dry and for there then to be a large storm event that generates a flood pulse where you can see the ""front"" of the river moving down the system and eventually reaching the ocean (maybe, depending on whether there's enough water to make it to the ocean before it evaporates and/or infiltrates) over the course of hours/days/weeks depending on the size of the system."
192,"Since we no longer have tails and that has been that way for a very long time, why do we still have tailbones?","Having a tailbone doesn't impede us or interfere with our daily life in any way, so there's no reason for it to have evolved away. There are some ultimately useless evolutionary remnants (aka. vestigial structures) in our bodies, but as they don't actively make our lives and survival more difficult, there's no evolutionary impetus for them to go away."
193,Can sparks form in space?,"Yes, but they would take slightly longer to cool until they hit the surface.

Sparks aren't generally caused by the rock/metal burning as it's sawn (most rocks can't even oxidize any further), but rather shards of the material just being *really* hot because the saw is using kinetic energy to break the bonds in it, and that energy (both from the saw and the broken bonds) must go *somewhere*. They'll stay hotter a bit longer because there's no air to conduct heat away from them (though they will radiate heat). Once they hit the surface of the moon, they'll cool off and stop glowing very quickly (like they would on Earth) as they dump their heat into the regolith.

Even some oxidation sparks (like from fireworks) would work\* in a vacuum, ~~and they might even work better~~. Black powder has its oxidizer mixed in, so it doesn't actually need air to burn and would keep going just fine (once lit). It will go out if you douse it with water, but that's because the water cools it off, rather than smothering it. ~~So black powder may burn even faster in a vacuum (though it would vary with composition\*\*, so it's hard to say~~). Edit: It would probably be slower or equal for most applications because the air is either mostly absent already (when densely packed) or acting to transfer heat.

&#x200B;

\*As was pointed out [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15nmagi/comment/jvp8ihh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): the lack of atmosphere would also make it harder for heat to transfer from one grain of powder to the other, so this also depends heavily on how the grain is packed. A fuse would still burn, but loose powder or a firework might not (or at least, not well). I was thinking purely from a chemistry standpoint, from which black powder is a bit like rocket fuel in that it brings its oxidizer with it, but the physical configuration of actual black powder devices (made by packing individual grains) is important."
194,Why is the smallpox vaccine administered using a bifurcated needle rather than through injection?,"On top of what was said, it was also designed for practicality and cost.  Imagine having to inject billions of people with a typical syringe. It’s too slow, costly, and requires skill. The bifurcated needle was cheap as dirt, delivered the perfect amount of vaccine, required little skill to use, and could be rapidly used to administer the vaccine to billions of people. One of the greatest medical devices ever invented in the history of man, imo.

EDIT - I found the source I’ve read before about smallpox eradication, so to put this in perspective further:

* the bifurcated needle delivered the vax at the ideal depth with rapidity 

* it only cost $5 for 1000 needles

* use of the bifurcated needle allowed vaccinators to deliver 100 vaccinations from a single vial

* pulling this off in real life is harder to comprehend.  India was extremely difficult. People there had more transportation and ability to move large distances very quickly (lots of rail, buses, etc.), so by the time they learned of a smallpox case, the person infected could already infect dozens more due to transportation. In order to eradicate smallpox from India, WHO had the goal of trying to visit every village and door in the country *in only 10 days*.  There’s no way they could have pulled that off unless their huge  volunteer army consisting largely of lay people and untrained medical professionals had the right tool to deliver the vaccine. That’s why it’s such a remarkable device."
195,Why can humans eat chocolate but other animals will die?,"Its the Theobromine and it's also poisonous to us, just at a larger dose.

All things we consume have a LD50 value, that is how much of it consume leads to the death of 50% of the species.

The LD50 for chocolate for Dogs is 300 mg/kg, Cats 200 mg/kg, for humans its 1000 mg/kg.  Given dogs and cats are smaller than us and a need a 3-5x less to be poisonous, a normal serving that is safe to us, may not be to them.

Now, some animals can eat even more chocolate than we can kg for kg.    Rats LD50 for theobromine is over 1200 mg/kg."
196,What does water expand for?,"The water molecules in ice sit further apart than they do in water (on average). So ice is less dense.

This is because water forms only 4 bonds with other water molecules in (some) ice crystal structures. So each water molecule has 4 nearest neighbors. In liquid water the molecules are much more free to move about and on average exist closer to one another, with more nearest neighbours. The 4 bonds in the solid phase is quite different to many other materials, for example metals. Metals in their solid crystals phases pack closely together. Typically metal atoms in the solid phase have 12 nearest neighbors and are so much more densely packed.

The 4 bonds for water arises because of its tetrahedral structure (and because hydrogen bonds are viable). This behaviour of less dense solid phases can be found with other tetrahedral structural materials such as some silicon allotropes and silica.

Why does liquid water have a density maximum at 4 degrees C? This requires a different more in-depth explanation."

198,Don't animals require a diverse diet like humans do? Is giving dogs/cats/pets one type of food unhealthy?,"In the wild a diverse diet is not necessary for survival. Food is scarce enough as it is and animals can not be too picky when it comes to what to eat since any missed meal could be their last for quite some time. 
Animals that are too picky with food sources end up dying off when that food source is gone. 

Remember the end goal for all life is to survive long enough to produce viable offspring that can survive and pass down your genes. As long as whatever diet availeable can help them survive long enough to reach that goal then they still succeeded.

Kibble was created to provide an inexpensive food that can be stored long term at room temperate without going bad and be fortified with the essential macro, vitamins, and minerals needed.

Animals usually follow a whole prey diet and because dogs and cats got scraps through out human history unless they caught their own food they were not getting complete nutrition anyway so kibble was made to solve this problem. However as production increases quality decreases to meet the increased demand as more and more fillers and substandard meats gets used.

Treating our pets like family members and giving them human grade food is a recent development and people priortizing real and raw whole food for pets is a new thing. So while kibble is still crap the quality of pet food is improving."
199,"Have I missed something, or are there some cosmic coincidences in Earth's seasons?","These are both coincidences / over-simplifications and both things that change through time.

> I just see no reason why the two extremes of distance with the sun should correlate with the two extremes of our axis of rotation relative to the plane of our orbit around the sun.

They don't, or at least, they don't exactly. The [solstices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solstice) and the timing of [perihelion/aphelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis#Earth_perihelion_and_aphelion) are offset by about 2 weeks at present. More importantly, this also reflects a current snapshot of the system as the timing of these relative to each other vary as a function of where the Earth's orbital parameters are in the various [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles). The period of the cycles related to obliquity and eccentricity are not the same, so the relationships between the timing of solstices and perihelion/aphelion will change through time. Changes in the relative timing of these do certainly have climatic effects. For example, the [African Humid Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_humid_period#Causes) (also sometimes called the ""Green Sahara"") reflected a time where the northern hemisphere summer solstice corresponded to perihelion.

> Nor any reason why the southern hemisphere should have more water than the north to conveniently(!) moderate the intensity of the summer experienced in the south.

This is again coincidence, but one related to tectonics. Plate tectonics (and in a related sense, supercontinent cycles) move the plates around, including the continental crust portions. There have been various times when the majority of land is in the southern hemisphere (e.g., the [Late Carboniferous](http://scotese.com/late.htm)) or times where there's been a more equal distribution between northern and southern hemisphere (e.g., the [Jurassic](http://scotese.com/jurassic.htm)).

So for both, you're looking at the current state of several things that change independently (though obliquity and eccentricity are not truly independent) and seeing a particular pattern. How those things do or do not line up at this moment in geologic time is purely coincidental and would be / have been different in the future / geologic past. I.e., it's like looking at a series of pendulums swinging at different rates and arbitrarily assigning meaning to the instants where they're all at a particular position."
200,What happens to a molecule when one of the atoms radioactively decays?,"I'll answer this for minerals specifically. The atoms that make up an individual mineral grain are arranged in an [ordered lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure) where a specific ""site"" within the lattice accommodates a particular type of atom, where the easiest (but overly simplified) way to think about it is that the ""correct"" atom for that site will be a function of both ionic radius and charge. If we consider a site occupied by an unstable atom, for example a ^(40)K atom within a potassium bearing mineral or ^(238)U within either a uranium bearing mineral or a mineral for which uranium can ""substitute"" for one of the normal components of the lattice (e.g., uranium substituting for zirconium in a zircon crystal), when a decay happens we can consider two different effects: **(1)** there may be some amount of ""recoil"" (depending on the type of decay) that can damage the crystal lattice and **(2)** typically the radioactive product is not the right fit for the lattice (either in terms of charge, ionic radii, or both).

**For the recoil effect**, the general idea is that in decay types where the result is the ejection of a particle with some mass, then some of the energy of the decay is converted to kinetic energy that can damage the lattice. During an [alpha decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay) (e.g., which occurs multiple times during the decay of a single atom of ^(238)U to ^(206)Pb), an alpha particle (He nucleus) is ejected from the atom. This imparts a small amount of recoil (just like the kick in firing a gun), but because the mass differential between the emitting atom and the alpha particle is usually quite large (think a big heavy cannon shooting a tiny little BB), there is only a small amount of movement of the emitting atom, whereas the alpha particle is shot out pretty fast (and sometimes may actually be shot out of the crystal). The alpha particle is light and small enough that it typically does not damage the lattice, but the small shift of the decaying atom can distort the lattice a bit around the site where it sits. 

This recoil effect, and the damage it causes the lattice, can be much more extreme in [spontaneous fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_fission). As the name implies, this is a decay mode where an atom suddenly splits into two usually somewhat equal (but not necessarily exactly equal) massed atoms. In this case, both products have a good amount of kinetic energy and have enough mass/size that they can significantly damage the lattice, leaving behind what you can kind of think of as little bullet tracks, i.e., [fission tracks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_track_dating#/media/File:%C3%87jkgfmj.jpg). For natural materials, isotopes that occur in any real abundance and are heavy enough to undergo spontaneous fission are ^(232)Th, ^(235)U, and ^(238)U, where the vast majority of fission tracks are created by ^(238)U. Spontaneous fission events are rare compared to ""normal"" decay of these isotopes, but they do happen (and we can use them to [date a mineral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_track_dating)).

Collectively, the small recoil effect from alpha decays and the much larger recoil effect and resulting fission tracks from spontaneous fission are referred to as ""radiation damage"" within crystals and in terms of the lattice, they represent ""defects"". Defects in crystal lattices can actually move around and/or be closed and effectively ""heal"" themselves over time, but it's a temperature dependent process. At high temperatures, individual portions of the lattice can easily move (through the propagation of [dislocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation), etc.) and this radiation damage is quickly (in a geological sense) healed. At lower temperatures, the processes allowing crystals to heal are less efficient so radiation damage is effectively permanent (unless the crystal is heated up again).

EDIT: It's worth explicitly stating that other decay modes (e.g., beta decay, electron capture) would not be expected to cause any damage to the lattice.

**With respect to the decay product itself**, as described above, these are often atoms that are not ""happy"" in the lattice, i.e., they have the wrong charge or size for the spot they're in within the lattice. Through somewhat similar processes as the healing of the radiation damage, these ""impurities"" tend to diffuse out of the crystal, but again this is a temperature dependent process. At high temperatures, this diffusion is relatively efficient and these products can often move out of the crystal easily. At lower temperatures, these products, even though they're unhappy, can't effectively move out of the crystal and get stuck because there is insufficient energy to allow them to move (or to allow the lattice to deform enough for them to move). This rate of diffusion is mostly temperature dependent, but will also strongly depend on the type of atom in question (e.g., what is the radioactive product), the type of lattice (e.g., what mineral is it in), and other details (e.g., grain size of the crystal, the rate of temperature change of the crystal, etc.). For a given type of crystal and type of radioactive product, we can consider that there is a [closure temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_temperature) for the system, where above the closure temperature diffusion is efficient enough that the radioactive products easily leave the crystal and below the closure temperature, diffusion out of the crystal is very inefficient to the point where we can consider it a ""closed"" system. The radiation damage from above can also play a role here as lots of radiation damage can make a crystal ""leaky"" and allow certain radioactive products to diffuse out more easily (which effectively changes the closure temperature). 

As an aside, we actually use this idea of a closure temperature to great effect in radiometric dating. Specifically, for a system (i.e., a mineral and particular radioactive parent and child isotope pair), if the closure temperature is near or above the crystallization temperature we can use that as a [geochronometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geochronometry), i.e., the time when the system becomes closed reflects when the mineral formed. If instead, the system has a closure temperature well below the crystallization temperature, then we can use it as a [thermochronometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochronology), where the time since the system became closed reflects when the crystal cooled to a specific temperature range.

**TL;DR** Considering a crystalline solid with an ordered crystal lattice (i.e., a mineral), some decays do damage the lattice. Specifically, alpha decays can impart small amounts of damage and spontaneous fission will leave clear tracks behind tracing the path of the two decay products. This damage can heal at high temperatures. The decay product usually is not the right size or charge to be stable in the lattice so will tend to diffuse out, but this is also temperature dependent. At high temperatures, broadly these decay products will easily diffuse out, but at low temperatures, there is insufficient energy for them to diffuse out of the lattice and they remain stuck."
201,Why does the Moon cause a water bulge on the far side of Earth?,"The far-side bulge is less intuitive. Since gravity's force decreases with distance, the gravitational pull on the far side of the Earth (the side away from the Moon) is less strong than the pull on the side of the Earth that's directly facing the Moon. In essence, the gravitational force is pulling the solid Earth more than it is pulling the water on the far side, effectively ""leaving behind"" a bulge of water on the opposite side. This effect, combined with the Earth's rotation, causes a second high tide on the side of the Earth farthest from the Moon."
202,"If the Earth is constantly gaining mass from picking up space debris, was the gravitational pull of Earth always 1G for as long as life existed?","The mass change over time, even vast lengths of time, is negligible.

From astronomy.com  
""Current estimates place the loss of hydrogen and helium at 6.6 pounds (3 kilograms) per second. That works out to just a tad more than 100,000 tons (90,700 metric tons) per year. When you compare that to the estimated mass of meteoric material that falls to Earth each year (approximately 50,000 tons), indeed, our planet does seem to be on a weight-loss program.
Don’t worry, though. If that diet remained constant over a billion years, our planet would have lost only eight-billionths of its total mass.""  
  
The mass loss is mostly from solar winds removing mass from the atmosphere."
203,How did Argon gas come to be present in the air? Did it arrive on a comet or is it a product of volcanic off-gassing?,"Almost all argon in the atmosphere ([>99%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_argon)) is ^(40)Ar and is thus the product of decay of ^(40)K. It follows then that the relative abundance of argon in the atmosphere reflects that potassium is a pretty common element in the crust (~2% by weight percent), though a relative small fraction ([~0.01%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_potassium)) of that is radiogenic potassium (^(40)K) that will decay to argon (or ^(40)Ca since decay of ^(40)K is a branched decay). The next most common isotope of argon, ^(36)Ar that represents about ~0.3% of all argon on Earth is also in part a product of decay of the cosmogenically produced radiogenic isotope [^(36)Cl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine-36), though given the abundance of ^(36)Ar in the sun (and thus presumably the solar nebula that formed our solar system), not all of this ^(36)Ar reflects in-growth from decay of ^(36)Cl. Small amounts of the third most abundant and stable isotope of argon, ^(38)Ar (~0.06%) can also be produced through reactions of ^(37)Cl with thermal neutrons, but these are relatively rare and don't contribute much to atmospheric argon (e.g., [Eikenberg et al., 1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0016703793900404)).

[Ballentine & Burnard, 2002](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/rimg/article/47/1/481/235410/Production-Release-and-Transport-of-Noble-Gases-in) provide a thorough discussion of production and transport of noble gases, including argon, within the solid crust to the atmosphere. Drawing from this work, if we focus mainly on ^(40)Ar and think about how it gets from a mineral in the crust (or mantle) to the atmosphere after it is formed via decay of ^(40)K, the first step mostly reflects it either diffusing out of a potassium containing crystal or leaking out of the crystal from fractures. Once the argon is outside an individual crystal / at the grain boundary, the primary mechanism for it reaching the surface is through being dissolved in a fluid (e.g., groundwater, magma) and then outgassing to the atmosphere when this fluid reaches/nears the surface. Some amount may diffuse through a rock volume toward the surface, but this is still largely reflecting dissolution in pore fluids and effectively is tracking diffusion through semi-connected pore fluids. Locations where magmatic fluids (e.g., volcanoes) or groundwater (e.g., springs) reach the surface are thus the primary sources of outgassing of argon (and other noble gases)."
204,How do you find deep oil deposits on land and under the see?,"There will be somewhat unique processes for most any reservoir, but the general steps would be something like:

1. Identification of the possibility of petroleum deposits via surface geology. This can take a lot of forms. At its simplest, it's recognizing that there is oil seeping out of the ground (and this can be the case for offshore deposits as well, i.e., oil seeps out of seabed and floats to the surface). More commonly, it's characterizing rocks exposed at the surface and recognizing that (1) a potential source rock exists, i.e., a rock with a dense organic content that if buried to the correct depth to reach the correct temperature would produce petroleum, (2) that a potential reservoir system exists, i.e., ideally a permeable unit with lots of porosity that lies above the source rock and is capped by a relatively impermeable unit to allow oil to accumulate in the reservoir, and (3) know enough of the stratigraphy (i.e., the rock types, how they're stacked, their basic geometries and lateral extents) and structural geology (i.e., how rocks are deformed by faults and folds) of the region to be able to project where the source rocks may have reached the ""oil window"" (i.e., the depth where the temperature is right to form petroleum) and whether there are likely any ""structural traps"", i.e., features like folds or faults that may allow for large concentrations of oil to accumulate in one relatively confined place. For many fields, there is some starting position like this based on the known surface geology, but once a proven field is discovered, a lot of work may be just looking for lateral equivalents.

2. Characterization of a reservoir by seismic imaging. This is really where we start to see what a reservoir looks like. This typically done via an active source seismic approach, i.e., an array of receivers are placed out on the surface of the earth (either land or via ship on the ocean) and we generate seismic sources through a variety of means. The depth range we can see to roughly scales with the energy of the source. For really shallow seismic surveys (few meters), the seismic source will likely be something very small and simple like hitting a metal plate on the ground surface with a hammer. For petroleum surveys, the sources will be *much larger*, i.e., explosions. This is all in contrast to ""passive source"" surveys where we use earthquake waves to image things. In active source, we can basically image things through the way seismic waves bounce off things in the subsurface (i.e., [reflection seismology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology)). This is not unlike the idea behind radar or echolocation in animals. From the seismic data, we can image the structure of our potential reservoir and look for the ""traps"" discussed above. From detailed analysis of the waveforms that bounce back, we can also make estimates of things like the fluid content of particular layers (i.e., is there likely petroleum in potential traps). 

3. The final stage of exploration is exploratory drilling. Once we think we have a good idea that there is an economically viable amount of petroleum (i.e., from our geology and seismic work, we think there are locations that have a lot of oil that would be worth extracting to recoup the money we've already spent to look for it and what we would have to spend to get it out), we have to start drilling to see if the oil is actually there, i.e., that the reservoir is ""proven"" to some extent. The drilling itself also provides a lot of data as we can take cuttings that come up as we drill to better characterize the geology down the hole and we can run instruments down the hole to measure various properties (e.g., [wire-line logging](https://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~earpwjg/PG_EN/CD%20Contents/GGL-66565%20Petrophysics%20English/Chapter%205.PDF)), both of which allow us to refine our model (and the way we interpret the seismic data) of the reservoir. The test borehole(s) ideally will find that there is petroleum where we think there is, but this improved characterization we get from drilling may also cause us to refine our reservoir model in such a way that we now think oil is a new place (requiring a new borehole, and so on). Ideally (for the company doing the exploration), we eventually find that there is viable petroleum where we think and we can start production.

It's worth noting that every-step of this process is progressively more expensive. The ""boots-on-the-ground"" geology is dirt cheap (from an oil company perspective) and largely not done by the oil company, i.e., they rely pretty heavily on geology done by academics or national/state geologic surveys to provide enough detail for them to start looking for oil. Seismic surveys are moderately expensive (again, from the perspective of an oil company, large active source seismic surveys like those done for oil exploration are usually out of reach financially for academics except in very large projects etc.), but the cost really depends on the details. Surveys at sea are a bit easier since you can just move your boat to wherever you want (but requires the infrastructure of a boat built for the purpose). Surveys on land can be trickier cause you generally need access (roads) and there can be all sorts of things in the way of setting up an ideal survey so they often take longer. Typically, because of the freedom afforded you by being on a boat, you can get better seismic data when you're on the ocean (e.g., a lot the 3D seismic data comes from offshore, as opposed to onshore because getting enough overlapping surveys to build 3D volumes from on-land surveys can be pretty hard, especially when access is not great). Drilling is typically the most expensive and will only be done if the previous steps give you a relatively high confidence that you'll find something when you drill."

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5546212/

EDIT: but not from, say, _H. habilis_ to chimps, that's too big a time gap.  As a general rule, you tend to see hybridization between groups separated by no more than a few hundred thousand years, the division between chimps and humans is more like 6 million years, and even Australopithecus is only known back about 4 million years, which leaves a good 2 million year gap."
206,How do plants create starch?,"Short answer: photosynthesis 

A plant uses the energy of light to combine carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The oxygen as ""waste"" is expelled, while the glucose monomers are being chained to long macromolecules, that we then call starch and are saved within storage compartments."

But Studies show uniform stimulus will result in a varied pain response- even in the same individual."
209,What makes phosphorus glow?,"When photons of the right energy hit an atom, an electron in that atom will become ""excited"" and start orbiting in a different pattern (more energetic electrons generally orbit further away from the parent atom and the [orbital](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics#/media/File%3ASpherical_Harmonics.png) often has a different shape. 

However, there are certain rules that the electron must follow when moving from one energy level to another - these rules involve ""quantum numbers"" which define the identity of the electron within the atom and can only take very specific values. These quantum numbers must change (or not change) by specific amounts when the electron goes up or down an energy level, but sometimes the electron gets a bit stuck. It might get hit by a powerful photon and go up many energy levels in one big jump, and then ""cascade"" back down the energy levels one by one, but then once it gets near the bottom of the energy ladder, it finds that it has the wrong combination of quantum numbers! It can't get down to the original energy level without breaking the rules, and so is stuck in what's called a ""metastable"" state until another separate (and slower) process frees it.

In phosphorus and other phosphorescent materials, this metastable state can last many minutes (instead of the normal hundred millionth of a second, which is nuts!), and so the material continues to glow long after the light source is removed."
210,What is the difference between the suffix -ose and -an in biochemistry?,"Glucose, fructose, sucrose and the like are specific small sugar molecules. The ones ending in “-an” refer to larger polymers, and describe classes of compounds rather than a specific molecule. Dextrans are made of 1-6 glucose linkages and can vary in size. Glycan refers to any number of carbohydrate polymers. Cellulose and chitin are glycans, as are the carbohydrate chains found in fungal and bacterial cell walls. Glycans may also contain compounds in them other that plain sugars, such as peptidoglycan, glycosaminoglycan, and chitin."
211,Why don't humans feel blood flowing in their vessels?,"The short answer is that there are few or no nerves to feel blood circulation in most places.

212,Does solar power capture heat that would otherwise have been reflected (as light)?,"According to Forster et al. the power of solar radiation reaching  the earth from the sun is on average 340 W/m². 100 W/m² are reflected. hence I will calculate with 240 W/m².

The surface of the earth is 510,000,000 km² = 5.1 \* 10^(14) m².

Hence the total power absorbed by the earth is 5.1 \* 10^(14) m² \* 240 W/m² = 1.2 \* 10^(17) W.

Radiative forcing by greenhouse gases is in the order of 1 W/m² hence total 5.1 \*10^(14) W 

Thermal Power of a nuclear power plant is below 5 \* 10^(9) W. This is only one hundred thousandth of the radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. All 410 nuclear power plants produce still well below 1 % of heat compared to greenhouse gases. 

Solar power: the sunlight is absorbed nevertheless by the surface. You will increase the albedo. But compared to the surface of the earth ...

Wind power: kinetic energy of the Wind is already converted radiative energy. Through absorption/friction with earth surface, trees, ... this energy would nevertheless be converted to heat.

&#x200B;

Whatever you do the effect is negligible compared to the radiative forcing by greenhous gases.

213,Does a metal box act as a Faraday cage?,">Does a completely enclosed metal box with solid walls act as a Faraday cage? 

Everything depends on the size of the hole. It has to be smaller than any wavelength you're considering. At 1 GHz the wavelength is 30 cm and a good Faraday cage can be easily built. If you're trying to block EMPs it's harder.

If you think about it, a mesh or a cage is basically a box with known holes with a fixed size. They are easier to ""apply"" than boxes. Imagine shielding an entire room. With a metal box you'd have to enclose the whole room in the box. A mesh is easier to apply and can be moved.

Whatever you do, you also have to remember that some metals oxide, and if the shielding material weakens, the Faraday cage becomes less and less effective."
214,Is there a natural system that can capture phonon energy similarly to photosynthesis?,"The other responses about heat are not precisely correct. Phonons are collective excitations of atoms in a lattice. Heat is the random motion of particles within a material. A baseball doesn't heat up when you throw it, and the air doesn't heat up the instant you blast music through it. Ultimately, that energy is dissipated as heat, because the collective motion becomes randomized by collisions. But the collective motions are not the same as heat.

In principle, phonons can couple to any other energy carrier. There are some restrictions based on symmetry, also known as Curie's principle. Phonon-electron coupling is piezoelectricity.

Edit: now I see OP's clarification about interest in biological systems. Plenty of biological materials are piezoelectric, but no energy metabolism based on piezoelectricity is known to exist. So there may be tiny currents in cells due to the effect but ATP isn't generated from it like it is from the electron transport chain, for example."
215,"How is quantum entanglement different from a controlled experiment in which a pineapple is thrown at a high speed to a symmetric object, scattering it into pieces, and measuring one of its piece in air to determine the properties (speed, spin) of other pieces in air?","You are asking one of the big questions in quantum physics. 

First, your understanding of entanglement is good, to a point. It is best to think of quantum entanglement as ""conservation laws on the atomic scale."" [This discussion from a few years back goes over this in more detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/jca8bg/am_i_properly_understanding_quantum_entanglement/), but basically, yes, entanglement and conservation go hand in hand. The pop-sci idea of entanglement, where once two particles are entangled, they stay entangled, and if you move one the other moves is not true. 

But, tacked onto the end of that linked discussion, but is more of the heart of your question- is how is quantum entanglement different from classical conservation laws. And as you touch on again- the big difference is wave-function collapse. So, using the most simple form of quantum entanglement, a spin 0 particle decaying into a spin up and spin down particle (so, total angular momentum is conserved), but we say both particles are in a superposition until measurement. That is, we say ""it's not that the particle is spin up and we just haven't measured it yet, it's that the particle is neither spin up nor spin down until we measure it, and then after we do, the other one instantly collapses to the opposite state.""

So, how do we know that this is the case, and not, as you propose, that it's deterministic, and we just don't have a way of measuring it yet. And the answer is, we don't quite know. But we do know something. And what we know is either it is not determined until measured (aka- classic wave function collapse) or the variable that determines whether the particle is spin up or spin down is not local to the particle that decayed and to the decayed particles, but instead if a global variable, connecting all of the particles in the universe. We currently do not have an experiment which can differentiate between these two possibilities, but most physicists feel a lot more comfortable with the wave-function collapse explanation than the global variable one. (If you want to Google this to learn more, you won't find much on global variables [other than learning about bad programming practices], instead you want to Google [local hidden-variable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden-variable_theory) which is the opposite- that is, there is a variable, that we just haven't measured, which determines if the particle is spin-up or spin-down. And what we know is, there is no local variable that makes this determination).

So, now you might ask ""how do we know this?"" The most straight forward explanation comes from [Bell's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem). And I wish I knew an intuitive explanation of Bell's Theorem, but it's pretty non-intuitive. But essentially, it goes like this. We set up the classic entanglement experiment- a series of particles of spin 0, that decay into spin up and spin down. We then have two people, each with a a polarizing film and a way to measure the spin of the particle, and each person randomly orients their polarizing film in one of several, pre-determined orientations. He's what we know. When we just so happen to have the films aligned parallel we must get opposite answers, and when they're anti-parallel we must get the same answer. But when they're so other orientation, we can predict the probability that the two people make opposite or the same measurements. And if you assume a classical model, that is- there is a defined spin and you just have to measure it, you get a different answer than if you assume there is not a defined spin, and measuring it collapses the wave function. And we have run this experiment (and many variations of it), and time and time again, we get the answer we expect from the non-classical, quantum mechanical prediction."
216,How did the shuttles that landed on the moon take off from the moon and come back to earth?,"The shuttles? They never touched down on the moon. 

 The craft that landed on the moon were specialised, designed for the express purpose of landing on the moon... Here, let me throw you a link. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module

This module was delivered to lunar orbit attached to another module, called the Command and Serice Module. When lunar orbit was achieved, the crew climbed from the CSM into the lunar excursion module (LEM), and decoupled the LEM from the CSM, and the LEM had onboard propulsion for two purposes. First, the propulsion system was designed to allow controlled descent of the LEM, onto the moons surface.

The descent stage, as mentioned, was for the landing, and the second stage, the ascent stage used the descent stage as a platform to take off from, in order to get back into lunar orbit, and rendevous with the CSM. At that point, after crew and samples had gone back aboard the CSM, the lunar module, a non aerodynamic craft, was jettisoned, either into lunar orbit or into a crash landing trajectory with the moons surface.

Heres a link to the CSM...

217,Why is Lithium concentrated in some places?,"Not specific to lithium, but for almost any economically viable deposit of metal the answer is segregation processes, e.g., [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/ore_veins/). For lithium, the two largest types of deposits are pegmatites (a type of intrusive igneous rock characterized by very large crystals, often associated with granites) and brines (e.g., [Kesler et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136812001539)). For the concentration of lithium in pegmatites, igneous segregation processes (like in the linked FAQ) are basically the explanation. For brines, these are remnants of lake environments that evaporated down to the point to concentrate a variety of minerals/metals (including lithium) within the remaining fluid and/or evaporitic minerals. Neither of these are in anyway associated with asteroid impacts.

In terms of impacts, there are some examples of impact melts that have produced economically viable metal ore deposits, most notably the Subury impact and the associated Ni-Cu-Platinum group ore body (e.g., [Keays & Lightfoot, 2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00710-004-0050-8)). To be clear, this has nothing to do with the composition of the asteroid itself (i.e., these are not metals from the asteroid), but rather *where* the impact hit and that it had sufficient energy to generate large volumes of melt in a location where, you guessed it, igneous segregation processes within those melts produced a concentration of metals and/or metal rich minerals. Ore deposits associated with impacts are relatively rare and I at least am not aware of any that specifically have viable amounts of lithium in them, but economic geology is not my specialty so maybe someone will provide an example. Suffice to say, even if there is an example, *virtually all lithium ore deposits are not impact related.*"
218,Same face of mountain evolves from arid to jungle-y... how?,"Questions like this are hard to answer definitively without detailed work / recent history of a given area. At the generic level, a non-exhaustive list of explanations for patterns like this could be:

1. Contrasts between a burned and unburned area. I.e., the more vegetated area has not burned recently and the less vegetated area has burned recently and during recovery, hosts a different set of vegetation (e.g., more scrub and grasses) that may have different seasonal behaviors than the vegetated / tree dominated area. If this was the case, you'd expect to see *some evidence* of a past burn (e.g., burned stumps, etc.) in the less green part of the landscape.
2. Contrasts in bedrock. The nutrient availability for plants is largely set by the soil which in turn depends a lot on the mineralogical makeup of the bedrock weathering to form the soil. In areas with a contact between different rock types, it's not uncommon to see changes in vegetation as the nutrients available (and potentially other aspects of soil, e.g., thickness, etc.) may vary between rock types and thus the vegetation that can be supported by that soil may vary. You could test this by looking at a geologic map of this same area and see if the contrast in vegetation is mostly coincident with a change in the underlying bedrock.
3. Microclimates. While given the scale and location of the topography in question, a rainshadow effect is definitely not likely, that doesn't mean there couldn't develop some persistent microclimate where certain hillslopes tend to get more rain than others. This is not a particularly likely explanation, but precipitation patterns can get pretty strange in rugged topography. This would be hard to test without meteorological records (i.e., weather stations) in both locations.
4. Hillslope aspect. There's a variety of observations and data highlighting that broadly, we often observe differences in vegetation and the shape of hillslopes depending on whether they face north or south (e.g., [Corrao et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.4114)). This is likely the result of a bit of a feedback loop where differences in vegetation (in part driven by differences in the amount of solar radiation they receive) influence the soil properties and details of water availability, which in turn further accentuate the differences between the north vs south facing hillslopes and the vegetation they host. Looking for consistent patterns in vegetation on north vs south facing slopes in the same region and/or actually quantifying the topography (i.e., are there measurable differences in hillslope angle, etc. along with changes in vegetation) would help to clarify this.

Of the above, if I had to guess, the hillslope aspect one actually makes the most sense. If we look at the [satellite imagery for this area](https://www.google.com/maps/@-13.1794312,-72.5487187,8596m/data=!3m1!1e3?entry=ttu), broadly the north facing slopes are the less vegetated/browner and the south facing slopes are the more vegetated/greener (though it's definitely not a clean pattern). This is basically exactly what you'd predict for a southern hemisphere location considering controls on hillslope aspect. E.g., [Yetemen et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015WR017103) demonstrate that generally in the northern hemisphere, you expect north facing slopes to be more vegetated than south facing slopes and the pattern is reversed in the southern hemisphere, i.e., south facing slopes are expected to be more vegetated and north facing slopes less so. 

This is not definitive and like I said in the beginning, you'd need to know a lot more about the local conditions and history to answer a question like this definitively, but it fits relatively well with expected differences in north vs south facing slopes."
219,Air quality alert levels compared to BBQ/kitchen/bonfire?,"Local sources of particulate matter can massively increase pm. A stove, even with only a little visible smoke, can easily reach 300ppm in a kitchen. A bon fire is better, because the high heat and it being outside generally gets the particles away from people. 

There are other pm sources too. Chainsaws, quads, etc. small engines are pretty bad due to incomplete combustion. 

Basically, yes. The average pm rating in your area is being reported because it's the baseline for everyone. But it's very easy for individuals to have very different exposure from that baseline, depending on where you live and what you're exposed to. In many cases, indoor air quality is worse than outdoor, even when the outdoor aqi is high."

221,Is it possible that Earth could be a captured rogue planet? Why or why not?,"No - there are a few things we could expect to see from captured rogue planets which are not true of Earth:

* Highly eccentric orbits. Earth's orbit is very close to circular, and if it came in from outside something would have to have circularized it, and there's nothing obvious that could or would. 
* A random inclination relative to the rest of the solar system and Earth's spin. Earth's orbital plane closely matches the rest of the solar system, instead of being at something like a 60^o angle which is far likelier for a captured object.
* Being far from the Sun. A rogue planet has to lose some of its energy to stay captured, otherwise it's like a golf ball hitting the cup too fast and popping back out. The closer to the Sun you are, the more energy you need to get rid of to stay there. The Earth is much, much closer to the Sun than you would expect from a rogue planet. 
* Different chemistry. You'd expect a significant difference between the composition of Earth and other planets or asteroids if they didn't form from the same nebula.

I'm sure there are others as well I haven't mentioned."

224,"How the old telephone secure line work, specially between countries?","It depends on just how old you are talking, and exactly who is talking to whom.

One of the very earliest methods of ""encrypting"" (quotes are there for a reason) telephone conversations was to use a frequency inversion scrambler. [This was a device that went over your telephone handset and garbled your voice by making the low pitched sounds high pitched and the high pitched sounds low pitched.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_inversion) if someone on the other end had the same device, they could turn it on to unscramble your voice. If you've watched some old movies or spy shows, in the early days where people would say things like ""enable security"" over a telephone line and then flip a switch, this would have been the kind of thing they were theoretically turning on. Another way to do this would be to literally have a record player with a special record of loud noise. If both people had the same record and they turned it on, it would make their voices completely incomprehensible, but if you knew what the noise was,you could use phone circuitry to subtract the noise. Either way, it would make it difficult or impossible to understand what was being transmitted over the phone line unless you had the appropriate technology to undo it.

For many decades, though, actual encryption has been used. Generally this is accomplished by encoding the voice signal digitally, then using an encryption algorithm to change it from something that is understandable by humans to something that sounds like random noise. But again, the concept is the same: if you're talking to someone with the appropriate hardware and the necessary encryption keys, they can decode it back into understandable speech. To anyone in the middle, it just sounds like noise. And with more modern encryption, it really is noise in the sense that you genuinely can't decipher it without having the key. If you know what a modem sounded like with the beeps and hisses, it would sound like that.

The advantage of this system is that as long as the two two people at either end have the encryption equipment, you can just send the encrypted data over a normal phone line and nobody who's in between and tapping the line will ever be able to understand what's being said. So it's not difficult to establish a secure phone line: it's just a regular phone line, and you make it secure by enabling this equipment."

226,What is happening on a microscopic and subatomic level when welding metal?,"You generally melt the two sides of the weld, and then either try to get the flow fronts to join into each other or your introduce a filler material to make up the gap. The alloys (both the ones being welded and any filler material) are designed in such a way to prevent the different heat treatment on the weld line (and nearby, known as the Heat Affected Zone). The weld schedule (speed; power used; width, depth, and temperature of melt pool; etc) is also highly alloy dependent.

Once the material has melted and been stirred together, it's allowed to cool off and then solidified back into a metal. It's at this point all the clever alloying comes into play to make sure you get the properties you want from the phases you can grow."
227,Why does the mushroom cloud of atomic bombs only shoot straight up and not in all directions (like a sphere)?,"It does expand spherically initially.  The size of the explosion is determined by the size of the device/amount of nuclear material, of course.  Once energy is expanded/the chain reaction stops, the cloud moves upward due to convection; the extremely hot air of the explosion is much warmer than the air above it.  Therefore, it is more buoyant than the air above it and rises, like when you hold a beach ball or something under water. As it rises, colder air from above rushes down to fill the area left behind by the hot air.  So the cloud rises upward, leaving mainly clear air below it."
228,Do we know why bed bugs can’t spread parasite transmitted diseases such as Lyme disease and Malaria?,"At least part of the reason is that the respective carriers for Lyme (Ixodes ticks) and malaria (Anopheles mosquitoes) are *biological* vectors - meaning that the organisms (Borrelia and plasmodium, respectively) are dependent on being able to replicate in the insect vector for transmission. No replication in the insect, no transmission - it's why Lyme disease can't be transmitted by mosquitoes, and malaria can't be transmitted by ticks.

Some diseases have mechanical vectors, where there's no replication in the insects, they serve more like a dirty needle than a host. Bedbugs could, in theory, serve as mechanical vectors for some agents.

E: I'm not exactly sure *why* bedbugs don't serve as vectors for anything (that we're aware of). They seem to have the potential. Lice, for example, can spread diseases like trench fever (Bartonella) and typhus (Rickettsia). A medical entomologist might know :)"
229,Can we do cold welding in space?,"I think people in this thread are answering a question that you aren't quite asking. Cold welding as an *undesired* effect in space, yes, real problem. Using this to make strong welded parts is a different matter. Cold welding doesn't just happen when you have two parts in contact with each other; testing here on earth has shown that you can't reproduce cold welding with static contact of clean surfaces in vacuum under low load, even if you hold them there for several days. The cause of most cold welding failures in spacecraft is from vibrations and a kind of surface wear called fretting, usually during launch or orbital maneuvers.

Fretting happens when two metal parts are in direct contact and experience some kind of vibration or oscillating load. The repeated surface deformation at the interface can create a mechanical bond between the two surfaces, since each object's surface roughness gets kind of smooshed into the other. Fretting doesn't usually cause strong connections on earth because there's always an adsorbed layer of gases and water vapor, plus oxides on the metal surfaces. In space, once those surface layers go, they're gone. 

The adhesion forces between these surfaces are not usually strong. One European Space Agency study showed that adhesion forces as low as 0.3 N were enough to cause cold welding failures. Not kilonewton, 0.3 Newton. This is obviously not enough for a structural weldment. To make a structurally useful weld you need a lot more pressure. Cold pressure welding is done on earth to join things like wires, but the pressures become prohibitive for anything stronger than 7xxx series aluminum."
230,Is it possible for meteor impacts to create volcanic hotpots at antipodes?,"Plagiarizing a bit from previous answers I wrote - there's generally a consensus (and demonstrable evidence) that impacts cause melting and that sufficiently large impacts can produce similar volumes of melt to Large Igneous Provinces (e.g., [Elkins-Tanton & Hager, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X05005844)) and further suggestions that they might be able to initiate some amount of prolonged melting after the impact that would look similar to a plume (e.g., [Jones et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X02008245), [Jones, 2005](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article/1/5/277/137590/Meteorite-Impacts-as-Triggers-to-Large-Igneous)). Critically though, these are arguing for melting / LIP formation *colocated* with the crater (and basically obliterating/filling the crater), *not* antipodal or even significantly displaced from the impact site. By the time you're at an impact with sufficient kinetic energy to induce melting on the other side of the planet, you're basically at the scale of the moon forming impact where the entire crust and large portions of the mantle of the Earth were melted (i.e., to induce melting on the other side of the planet from the impact, you'd basically need to induce melting everywhere between the impact and the antipode). Following that, it's also worth noting that the ability to generate large volumes of melt depends a lot on the details of both the impactor (mainly its kinetic energy, so a mixture of its size, density, and velocity), but also the target (e.g., lithosphere thickness, mantle temperature, etc) and generating large volumes of melt is not common (e.g., [Ivanov & Melosh, 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/31/10/869/29143/Impacts-do-not-initiate-volcanic-eruptions)). For example, the Elkins-Tanton & Hager paper highlights that large volume of impact melting was likely more common earlier in Earth history both when impacts (some very large) were more common, but also the Earth was generally hotter and the vast majority of LIPs that are preserved today are not explainable with impacts.

I'm going to guess this question is inspired by the oft (misunderstood) hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact influenced the Deccan Traps eruption? With reference to this, the beginning of the Deccan Traps eruption cleary predates the impact by ~250,000 years (e.g., [Schoene et al., 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaa0118)) so the impact was not the cause of the Deccan Traps (or the plume that generated the Deccan Traps). There has been the suggestion that the impact may have led to a temporary increase in its eruptive activity (e.g., [Renne et al., 2013](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1230492)), but the evidence for this remains a bit enigmatic and depends on the precise timing of the particular eruptive phase relative to the impact. In terms of these details, there are some challenges related to mixing of different type of geochronometers (e.g., [Schoene et al., 2021](https://gchron.copernicus.org/articles/3/181/2021/)) that make conclusively rejecting or accepting the hypothesis of a trigger of an eruptive pulse in the Deccan Traps by the impact pretty hard."
231,How Does Rain Shadow Work in Cold Climates?,"There are a few requirements for generating a strong rainshadow. [Galewsky, 2009](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2008JF001085) provides a nice overview. In summary, if you have a dominant wind direction of sufficient average velocity oriented perpendicular to the average orientation of a mountain range with sufficient relief (difference in height between the crest and the lowlands), then a rain shadow can develop. This can be expressed with a simple equation *Nh/U* where *h* is the relief, *U* is the average wind velocity, and *N* is [Brunt-Vaisala frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunt%E2%80%93V%C3%A4is%C3%A4l%C3%A4_frequency). If *Nh/U* is greater than 1, you'd expect a rain shadow to develop, whereas if it's much less than 1, you won't get a rainshadow, which could reflect that either the windspeed is too great, the relief is insufficient, or the Brunt-Vaisala frequency is too low (or some combination thereof). In terms of your hypothetical, this would suggest you want the relief of your mountain range to be sufficient to generate an ""orographic barrier"", where empirical results suggest that relief of ~1.5 km is sufficient for this purpose (e.g., [Bookhagen & Strecker, 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL032011)), but this is not necessarily thinking about variations in *N* or *U* from above. Of these, the parameter we'd expect to vary with temperature is *N* as differences in this will reflect differences in [potential temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_temperature), so broadly we'd expect potential temperature to be positively related with average temperature (i.e., lower average temperature will mean lower potential temperature), but Galewsky discusses that even for values of *N* assuming an average temperature of below freezing, you still can get conditions where *Nh/U* is greater than 1 (and thus a rain shadow can develop), it will just depend on the other relevant details. 

If we assume a climate and relief where (1) conditions exist to generate a rain shadow and (2) where those conditions dictate that most precipitation will fall as snow, this does has some important effects as this implies that the precipitation can be carried further ""downstream"" (i.e., higher and deeper) into the range than rainfall (e.g., [Anders et al., 2008](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/36/6/479/29774/Influence-of-precipitation-phase-on-the-form-of)). If we consider examples of locations with either modern or past conditions of relatively cold climates (i.e., a lot of precipitation will fall as snow) and rain shadows, another prominent effect is that the windward side will tend to develop glaciers whereas the leeward side will have much more limited glacial activity. Good natural examples of this are the Olympic Mountains, Patagonian Andes, and Southern Alps in New Zealand. 


Finally, most natural examples and experiments considering the development of rain shadows considers linear ranges (though Galewsky, 2009 does briefly consider a circular, volcano like range). In your hypothetical of a ""ring"" mountain range, presumably one side would be facing the predominant wind direction, so this side would have the most extreme contrast between a clear windward and lee side. You would broadly expect that the sides of the ""ring"" parallel to the wind dominant direction to have a precipitation gradient both parallel to the wind direction (i.e., it decreases in the direction of the wind) and perpendicular (i.e., it would be dryer on the inside of the ring than the outside). An example of a precipitation gradient along a (linear) mountain that's roughly parallel to the wind direction is the Greater Caucasus, where this also is reflected in a gradient in the amount of glacial activity with more where it is wet and less where it is dry (e.g., [Forte et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16303004)). One unknown for your hypothetical would be depending on the size of the ring and other details, whether you'd expect to get some sort of development of weather systems within the basin. I think you'd have to try to model this to really answer that question."
232,How long does a queen live?,"Former bee researcher, queen vs worker development is a lovely example of epigenetics.

TLDR: since we haven’t solved immortality and all aging-related genetics or biology, it may be easier to explain WHY.. queens live longer because it is beneficial to their function as the center of stability and continuation in the hive. Workers live shorter lives as they serve both as the expendable high-risk resource gatherers and a work-force adaptable to changing environmental factors.

- Genomics: what genes an organism possesses and the specific variants of those genes.
- Epigenomics: which genes are “available” or “locked down” when it comes to biological activity. Biological activity in this case being expression via transcribing into RNA, eventually into protein, and doing activities.
- Transcriptomics: what RNA is being transcribed and in what levels from the genome.

This progresses down through protein (proteomics), how it effects metabolism (metabolomics), and several other fields that get bucketed as “-omics”.

So back to what the epigenetics effect. Do queens get royal jelly during development? Yes. Do workers? Also yes, just a different amount. Were the eggs different before this developmental signaling? In limited ways or not at all. So the genetics must be the same/similar. Epigenetics!

In the wild, worker bees raised during the summer survive for ~40 days. The first day as an adult, they can even be handled easily since they can’t effectively sting (limited musculature for the stab) and haven’t stored up much venom yet. Younger bees complete nursing behaviors (stay within the hive, don’t fly, care for queen/young/hive) and process the bee foods: bee bread (from pollen), honey (nectar), and royal jelly. Fat little buzzies as well, with a nice layer of adipose tissue that supports the glands they use for food processing (hypopharangeal glands). After ~3 weeks, the bees thin down, ditch the adipose layer, do an orientation flight to learn how to find their home, and get to foraging: find food, relay location/quality information to others via dancing, etc. This is a rough lifestyle, however. Foraging massively increases mortality risk by predation.

I didn’t study the winter bees as much, but the workers raised for this time survive for months. Ball up around the queen to keep her warm/healthy, ball moves through the hive to access food stores, fly out during warmer parts of the winter to expel waste and keep the ball hygienic.

So there isn’t one universal worker bee, they change over the seasons. Their death and turn over allows adaptation to changes.

Yet a queen can live for years. She’s typically bigger, has a non-serrated stinger (can sting repeatedly without risk of it ripping out and killing her), and expresses a queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) to signal whether new queen(s) should be raised via gradient: the older/sicker the queen and/or bigger the hive, workers get less QMP and will raise more queens by changing up that food ratio for the brood to set some eggs down the queen path rather than the worker path. New queens will either fight/supplant the current queen, or split off retinues of workers as swarms to go found new hives.

So all of this covers background, but what’s the difference? Signaling of genes that were already present when the egg was sitting, waiting for food ratios to direct the path of queen or worker: epigenetics. Queen development puts selective pressure on longer lifespans while worker development only has some pressure on lifespans during winter."

235,"Is there any suspected link between the ~50,000 year old meteor impact craters on Earth?","So first off, let's be precise with the ages. 

For Barringer crater, there are three different age estimates from three independent cosmogenic exposure ages, 49.7 ± 0.85 ka (thousand years), 49 ± 3 ka ([Phillips et al., 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001670379190387K)), and 49.2 ± 1.7 ka ([Nishiizumi et al., 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001670379190388L)) - which all overlap within uncertainty. However, these ages were all done in the pretty early days of surface exposure age dating and we've significantly refined the production rate estimations for these cosmogenic isotopes. Revisiting this data and applying more accurate production rates suggests the age of the crater is 61.1 ± 4.8 ka ([Barrows et al., 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maps.13378)).

For Xiuyan crater, dating is spotty. [Liu et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168583X12005691) could only constrain that it was older than 50,000 years from radiocarbon (i.e., it was beyond the functional limit of radiocarbon dating). The upper limit of the age is really poorly constrained but broadly considered to be ~5 million years (e.g., [Indu et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21004153)).

For the Yilan crater, radiocarbon dates suggest an age of 49.3 ± 3.2 ka ([Chen et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/maps.13711)).

Finally, the Lonar crater is really all over the place. Radiocarbon dates suggested a wide range of 1.79 ± 0.04–40.8 ± 1.1 ka ([Maloof et al., 2010](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/gsabulletin/article-abstract/122/1-2/109/125471/Geology-of-Lonar-Crater-India)), fission track produced a pretty ugly estimate of 15 ± 13 ka ([Storzer & Koeberl, 2004](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/1309.pdf)), thermoluminescence dating of impact glass suggested 52 ± 6 ka ([Sengupta et al., 1997](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Debashish-Sengupta/publication/287763263_Lonar_Formation/links/567929dc08ae6041cb49ed7a/Lonar-Formation.pdf)), a Ar-Ar date suggested a much older age of 570 ± 47 ka ([Jourdan et al., 2011](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/39/7/671/130623/40Ar-39Ar-age-of-the-Lonar-crater-and-consequence?redirectedFrom=fulltext)), and a combination of cosmogenic exposure and radiocarbon suggests 37.5 ± 5.0 ka ([Nakamura et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014GC005376)). Suffice to say, it's not clear which one of these dates is correct (though Nakamura have a reasonable explanation to rule out the anomalously old Ar-Ar date), but the majority of these do not overlap with the ~50 ka range of interest or more importantly with the ages of any of the other craters we're talking about.

In summary, of the four craters mentioned only really Barringer and Yilan have similar ages and *only* if we use the original (incorrect) ages of Barringer. **Ultimately, none of the ages of these craters overlap within uncertainty**. I'll also just point out a good resource in the form of a compilation of terrestrial impact ages from [Osinki et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825222001969) and a corresponding [website](https://impact.uwo.ca/)."

237,What exactly is a microstate?,"Discrete counting of microstates makes sense in a quantum context, where the energy states are quantized. In this case, given a macrostates, you can compute the number of microstates consistent with that macrostate. So in a quantum mechanical treatment, you can count everything just fine in principle. In practice though, we often typically course grain over everything and don’t necessarily count things discretely. So we’ll use something like the density of states etc. to help us. 

In a purely classical context, of course, we don’t have discrete counting of microstates for the reason you mention. If we wish to resolve this in a purely classical sense, we typically define entropy in a different but analogous way. 


For discrete systems, the general Gibbs entropy for non-equilibrium is defined as

     S = - k \sum p ln(p)

where p is the probability of any given microstate and we sum over all microstates. From this you can obtain the Boltzmann formula S = k ln(Omega) (the argument is that equal probabilities for each microstate maximizes the entropy). 

Now, for a continuous system, we define it very similarly. For something like a classical gas, we can just use something called the distribution function, which is solved via the Boltzmann or Fokker-Planck equation. The distribution function essentially tells you the probability density of any given microstate. As an easy example, the Maxwell-Boltzmann kinetic distribution function is

      f(x, v) = n (2 pi m / k T)^3/2 exp(- m v^2 / 2 k T). 

Here, n is number density, and the density and temperature are functions of position. The number of particles within a certain volume d^3 x and a phase space volume d^3 v is 

      dN = f d^3x d^3 v 

(In stat-mech we typically use momentum as a coordinate, but in kinetics we typically use velocity as a coordinate.) So if we want to calculate the total energy, we could count up the energy of every particle:

      U = \int 1/2 m v^2 dN 

(We can also compute the average energy per particle instead and so on.) 

We now define the entropy. The entropy for a non-equilibrium distribution function is given by:

      S = -k \int ln(f) f d^3x d^3v

(This is ignoring factors of Planck’s constant and so on, because we’re working in a purely classical context.) This is the entropy as defined in Boltzmann’s H-theorem. Importantly, S is a *functional*: it takes a function f as input and outputs a scalar. One can show via Lagrange multipliers that given the constraint of constant number of particles and constant energy (with 0 net momentum), the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is the function that maximizes the entropy. This is how we know the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is the classical equilibrium distribution. 

Notice that the formula is essentially the same as the -k ln(p) p formula, we’re just using the distribution function and integrating. One can make this connection more precise if you realize that course graining the quantum system will lead to a similar expression as the classical one (with appropriate factors of Planck’s constant and so on). 

For more information, I would read up on the Boltzmann H-theorem.

To put more concretely: in general non-equilibrium, entropy is a measure based on the probability  distribution of microstates. Essentially, S is the average of - k ln(p). For discrete states, you perform a discrete sum over all states given the discrete probability distribution. For continuous states, you perform an integral over all states given the continuous probability distribution."

243,Has the use of nuclear weapons have a noticeable effect on the environment up until now?,"I suppose it depends on what you consider as ""the environment"".

But nuclear weapons tests have had an impact on the practice of carbon dating objects.

Carbon dating is done on organic matter (for example: wood). The carbon in our atmosphere consists of different isotopes. The most abundant one, carbon-12 is stable. There's also carbon-14, which has a half life of about 5700 years. While carbon-14 decays, it is also created by in the atmosphere by cosmic radiation. Assuming the cosmic radiation is more or less constant, this results in some equilibrium level between the two isotopes. In organic matter that is no longer being replenished (in other words: it's dead), the carbon-14 level gradually decreases. So by measuring this level in and old object and comparing it to the atmospheric levels, the age of the object can be estimated.

Nuclear weapons tests caused a lot of neutrons to be sprayed into the atmosphere, which resulted in a spike in the creation of carbon-14. That means that carbon-14 levels in the atmosphere are higher than what they were before the tests. The levels are gradually declining to their pre-tests value, but this is a slow process (since the half life of carbon-14 is so long).

This effect has to taken into account when performing carbon dating.

(edit: This is not a complete answer to the question, as it describes just one effect. There are likely other effects such as effects on ecosystems that I'm not aware of.)"
244,Which X chromosome from a mother does a child get?,">Which X chromosome from a mother does a child get?

A mix of both.

When eggs and sperm are being created, they go through a process called [meiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) which gives each sperm or egg cell only one copy of each chromosome.  But as part of this process, [""chromosomal crossover""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover) occurs: matching genes of the two chromosomes are shuffled and swapped between them, so the final sperm and egg cells contain a mix of the contents of both.

Here's a picture example.  ""X11111111"" represents the X-chromosome the woman got from her mother; ""X22222222"" represents the X-chromosome from her father.  The chromosomes are first duplicated:

    X111111111111
    X111111111111
    
    X222222222222
    X222222222222

Then moved close together:

    X111111111111
    X222222222222
    X111111111111    
    X222222222222

Then crossover happens:

    X121121221221
    X212212112112
    X111112222111
    X222221111222

then split into four egg cells:

    X121121221221
    
    X212212112112
    
    X111112222111
    
    X222221111222

So you can see that any children created from these egg cells will have a mix of genes from both of their maternal grandparents.

This happens for all chromosomes in both sexes, except X and Y in genetic males which are too different to cross over."

247,"What is the highest wet bulb temperature a human can survive, assuming no (or negligible) humidity?","The estimated fatal wet-bulb temperature for humans (and most mammals broadly) is 35 C EDIT - assuming sustained exposure where the exact time is a bit fuzzy  - i.e., these are not instantly fatal and assumes a person is experiencing these conditions for several hours (e.g., [Sherwood & Huber, 2010](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0913352107)). An important point (which may not be clear given the way you're question is written) is that we would expect a wet bulb temperature of 35 C to be fatal *regardless of the relative humidity*. Differences in relative humidity imply different dry bulb temperatures for a given wet bulb temperature (where generally lower relative humidity implies greater differences in wet and dry bulb temperature where dry bulb temperature is always larger than wet bulb temperature until a relative humidity of 100% where they would be equal). 

So really, I think what you're asking is ""For a fatal wet bulb temperature, what's the equivalent dry bulb temperature as a function of humidity?"" For this purpose we can use a [psychrometric chart](https://clothingyellow.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/6/4/126448599/606372389.jpg). This [page](https://www.chemistryscl.com/higherstudies/chemicalengineering/psychrometric_chart/main.html) goes through the details of how to read one, but in short the x-axis is dry bulb temperature, the diagonal green lines are lines of constant wet-bulb temperatures, and the purple concave up curves are lines of constant relative humidity. So, the intersection of a vertical dry bulb temperature with a diagonal wet bulb temperature occurs at a specific relative humidity, e.g., for example the 30 C dry bulb temperature intersects the 20 C wet bulb temperature line at a relative humidity of 40%, i.e., if we measured a dry bulb temp of 30 C and relative humidity is 40%, we'd expect the wet bulb temp to be 20 C. 

Referring to the chart, we can then follow the 35 C wet bulb temp line and see what dry bulb temps they intersect. This is a bit tricky because the chart doesn't cover too much of this space, but the 35 C wet bulb line is there (though it's not labeled, you have to count up 5 from the 30 wet bulb line, it's the line between the ""40"" and ""45"" label along the top for the dry bulb temps). A little easier is to play with a [psychrometric calculator](http://www.hvac-calculator.net/index.php?v=2), which is basically doing the underlying math to construct a similar chart. For this, if you enter a dry bulb temp and a relative humidity and click calculate, it will fill in the rest, including the estimated wet bulb temperature. Using our assumption that a wet bulb temperature of 35 C is fatal, we can go through and with some trial and error find the equivalent dry bulb temperatures (Tdb) and relative humidity (rH) combos that would imply close to a fatal wet bulb temperature:

* 45 C Tdb & 56% rH
* 50 C Tdb & 43% rH
* 55 C Tdb & 31% rH
* 60 C Tdb & 22% rH
* 65 C Tdb & 17% rH (the calculator starts to break much above 65 C)

The *big* caveats here is this is relying on the underlying assumptions in this calculation are met (e.g., we're at sea level, the default values used in the calculator for the other parameters are correct for the conditions in question, etc.) and that there are not other physiological issues that would take over at extreme dry bulb temperatures but where wet bulb temperature does not exceed 35 C, but since largely the fatal wet bulb temperature limit is basically tracking when the combination of air temperature and humidity make it such that a mammal cannot effectively cool itself anymore, this probably puts us in the right ball park for fatal combinations. 

Assuming all of this is correct (which is probably a big assumption), we'd perhaps expect that at *really low humidity* a temp above 55C is survivable. EDIT: See important correction from u/dyrin in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/15920n3/comment/jtdwjnj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that suggests the 35 C limit is an overestimate in many conditions, i.e., fatal wet bulb temperatures experienced for significant times are likely less than 35 C in many instances."
248,What is meant by 'Ocean Current Collapse'?,"Ocean currents, and specifically what we call [thermohaline circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation) are one of the primary ways that heat is moved around the planet. Specifically, a lot of solar heating occurs at the equator / tropics, and the movement of some of this heat towards the poles via thermohaline circulation in the oceans is an important mechanism for (1) dissipating heat in the tropics and (2) warming the poles, i.e., generally decreasing the gradient in temperature between the equator and poles. It's worth mentioning that thermohaline circulation in the oceans is not the only mechanism that accomplishes this, e.g., [Hadley cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_cell) in the atmosphere are also important, but it's fair to say that thermohaline circulation is a *very big* player in heat transfer from the equatorial regions to the polar regions.

As the name implies, thermohaline circulation is representing both temperature and salinity differences. At the most basic level, this circulation is driven by density contrasts where cold and/or salty water is more dense than warm and/or fresher water and globally what we see is currents of less dense water moving along the surface until they become dense enough to sink (e.g., through loosing their heat) and then move along the bottom (or generally below the surface), forming a ""global conveyor"" of ocean water that broadly is distributing heat/salt and pushing the ocean toward more homogeneity. If we look at a [map of the ""global conveyor""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Thermohaline_Circulation_2.png), we can see that it's not as simple as just warm water moving toward the pole. This reflects that the global thermohaline currents are a mix of ""meridional overturning circulation"" (i.e., the component that's bringing warm water toward the poles where it cools and sinks and flows back toward the equator) and the effects of global winds and tides. 

The meridional overturning circulation is basically the part we're concerned about, and particularly the [Atlantic meridional overturning circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation) or AMOC. What has generated the latest concerns about AMOC is a paper by [Ditlevsen & Ditlevsen, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w) that argues that we're nearing a ""tipping point"" where the behavior of AMOC will fundamentally change. Basically, from prior work it's been shown that AMOC may have two stable modes of operation, a ""strong"" mode, where it efficiently brings warm waters into the North Atlantic and as a result significantly moderates the temperature of northern/western europe, and a ""weak"" mode where the extent to which warm waters enter the North Atlantic are significantly reduced (see for example the introduction to [Boers, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01097-4) for a brief synopsis). What the Ditlevsen & Ditlevsen paper is arguing is that we're getting pretty close to a set of conditions that will push AMOC from the ""strong"" to the ""weak"" state, i.e., a tipping point.

So why is this happening and what does it mean if it happens? Both of these have been discussed, *a lot*, here. For a deeper dive on both, I'll refer to you [to this previous thread - spurred by panic when the Boer, 2021 paper from above was released](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/oyrnua/how_will_cooling_as_a_result_of_the_amoc_current/). In short, the change in state of AMOC is primarily being driven by huge influxes of cold, fresh water from the melting of Greenland that is disrupting the thermohaline circulation. For effects, if AMOC transitions to this ""weak"" state, what this implies is that a lot less heat will be transferred to the North Atlantic. This means that the modulating effect of a *relatively* warm North Atlantic has on the climate of northern/western Europe will decrease and that temperature wise, these locations would start to look more like areas at comparable latitudes that don't benefit from something like AMOC (think Canada, Russia). At the same time, less heat would ""escape"" the tropics, so the southern Atlantic (and surrounding regions) would get a bit of extra warming. For refs, uncertanties and more details (and a discussion of expected precipitation changes as well), refer to the linked thread. Also in that, it highlights these changes are the most extreme in the areas directly influenced by AMOC, but in general it leads to global changes in the differences in temperature and precipitation. 

Finally, as discussed in prior threads on AMOC, there's a lot of details we still don't know about the transitions between states (or whether there truly are two stable states) and how close we are to a ""collapse"" / transition is hotly debated. This new paper is concerning for sure, but [as highlighted in comments from others working on the problem](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/25/gulf-stream-could-collapse-as-early-as-2025-study-suggests), the results of this new work is not definitive. That's not meant to imply that this is not a very concerning potential result or that we can safely ignore this, but it does mean that we need to consider that there remains a lot of uncertainty as to exact outcomes and timelines.

**TL;DR** Global ocean currents are incredibly important in moving heat and reducing the temperature differences between the equator and the pole. These currents are driven by temperature and salinity related density contrasts and changes to those, e.g., from huge influxes of cold, freshwater from melting ice sheets, can disrupt them. The specific current (AMOC) that people are concerned with brings warm water into the North Atlantic. If this switched to a weaker state, then less heat would reach the North Atlantic. The most immediate effect is that this would lead to cooling and drying of northern/western Europe and heating/drying of the tropics, but the transition of AMOC to a weak state would have global ramifications for temperature/precipitation. The new paper that just came out suggests that we're pretty close to a transition from a strong to a weak AMOC, but more broadly, this is a pretty controversial topic."
249,Have there been attempts to make protons or neutrons using quarks other than up and down?,"Configurations of other quarks are seen in places like particle colliders, but they aren't protons and neutrons. They are different particles. There's a [table of them here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_baryons). For example, two up and a strange quark make a Σ^+ baryon.  

It's worth noting that quarks are not seen by themselves, they are only ever seen in configurations with other quarks or anti-quarks. In fact, the consensus is that quarks *can't* be isolated as individual particles, which is called confinement."
250,Are earthquakes a good illustration of how sound waves travel through matter?,"Presumably what they meant is that the propagation of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave) that are generated by an earthquake are a good illustration of sound waves propagating through a material (and in detail, a sound wave and a seismic wave are both just [acoustic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_wave)). In detail, if we're thinking about sound waves in air (or water), the most relevant seismic wave is the [p-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_wave) as acoustic waves in fluids are also compressional waves (like the p-wave). Since we usually think about seismic waves traveling through solids, we get other [types of waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave#Types). If we're instead thinking about sound waves traveling through a solid, then pretty much the full range of types of seismic waves are the same since they are effectively the same thing."
251,"Why was ""making heavy water"" a mistake?","I haven’t seen the movie, so hopefully I’m not missing some key piece of narrative context here. But there’s nothing *inherently* wrong with using heavy water as a moderator for plutonium production. There are heavy water reactors in use today, and they work just fine.

But in, say, 1940, research into nuclear reactors was in its early stages, and scientists were still trying to figure out what materials would even work and what wouldn’t. Graphite (relatively cheap and easy to come by) was tested, but the French and Germans both found that graphite didn’t work in practice…it absorbed too many neutrons and “poisoned” the reaction. Heavy water worked, but it was very expensive and very hard to procure, so building working reactor piles with it would be slow and costly…but since graphite was out, the Germans resigned themselves to heavy water.

The American team figured out that the only problem with graphite was impurities…trace amounts of boron in “usual” graphite was responsible for the unwanted neutron absorption. By this point, however, the USA had put a stop to any new publication of nuclear scientific research, so there was no paper published that the German scientists could learn from. The Americans were able to produce purer graphite, still much cheaper and faster than acquiring heavy water, and so the Americans were able to set up nuclear piles and start experimenting with material while the German scientists were still struggling to pull together enough heavy water to get going. 

So, the “mistake” would have been not realizing on their own that graphite impurities were the issue, a mistake that (among many other hindrances) set the Germans even further behind the Manhattan project team."
252,At what point of the sun's death will life on earth no longer be viable?,"Most life on Earth will be extinct long before the Sun becomes a Red Giant some 4-5 billion years from now.

While the Sun remains a main sequence dwarf until then, it is gradually brightening by ~1% every 100 million years.  While different models predict different timelines, somewhere between 700 million years and 1.5 billion years, the surface of the Earth will be too warm for liquid water to exist, leaving a parched and likely sterile surface.  Some subterranean life may persist – either some current extremophiles or their distant descendants shaped by a billion more years of evolution."
253,How were free neutrons first created en mass?,"The ""Urchin"" neutron initiator used Polonium-210 and Beryllium-9.  The Polonium-210 emits an alpha particle which interacts with the Beryllium-9 to spit out a neutron.  For safety, the Po and Be were stored separately, and heavily shielded.  They are added to the bomb at the last moment, and kept separated and shielded inside the bomb until the bomb detonates.

U-235 and Pu-239 will produce neutrons basically spontaneously once you get a critical mass.  The trick is getting it to happen in a controlled fashion.  So part of the Urchin initiator was the explosive compression of the bomb's core until it reaches supercriticality.  The explosion also mixes the Polonium and Beryllium at the center, which floods the compressed fissile material with neutrons right when it becomes supercritical, allowing the chain reaction to occur everywhere in the core at once.

254,Is the concept of alpha males among animal species scientific?,"“Alpha male” as a concept was developed under dubious circumstances to understand wolf social hierarchies. However, wolves don’t have a despotic hierarchy. 
Today, the notion of an (alpha male/female) is simply a short-hand for talking about more complex social dynamics. “Alpha” refers to a position in a social hierarchy not a suite personality traits. It mostly has to do with who has preferential access to resources (mostly food).  

We (I’m an anthropologist who studied primate social relations for more than a decade) do not use “alpha” in the way that it is used among certain swaths of people. One reason is that it’s not analytically tenable. There typically is no single behavioral pattern found in dominating individuals. For some species (like rhesus macaques), rank is inherited form your mother (if you’re a female). For chimps, it’s negotiated through repeated encounters. In chimps, how one becomes a dominant male differs from group to group and even individual to individual. Other animals don’t have steep, despotic hierarchies at all. 

For humans, it’s tricky. Males being in positions of power is the general trend but there is nothing that necessitates this. It also varies given the context. Males might have more political power but less domestic power. Men might hold important religious roles but don’t manage land. There are so many dimensions to human social life that there isn’t a universal pattern. 

The alpha concept is generally an oversimplification and doesn’t explain much about social dynamics in a group, apart from where a single individual ranks in the group. 

For example, I studied the effects of ecology on rhesus macaque social hierarchy. They tend to have really steep, stable hierarchies. But the group I studied wasn’t like that though. There were very few hierarchy maintenance behaviors because they didn’t need to compete for food. The individual who was the “alpha” could displace other individuals, but it happened rarely. So what utility does describing her as alpha bring to the table. It was much more interesting to understand how aggressive social interactions were negotiated, how the hierarchy shifted over time, how despotic they were, and what factors shaped the social structure. Knowing who the alpha was didn’t really tell me much about the complex social dynamics happening at the site."
255,Dinos be heavier than today's land animals because there was more centrifugal force to set off gravity?,"This is a very small effect. Centripetal acceleration is calculated using omega^(2)\*r, where omega is the angular velocity and r is the radius. 

Acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth is ~9.8m/s^(2).

256,"Peak power production in the Sun has been compared to the volumetric heats generated in an active compost heap. At the center of the Sun, theoretical models estimate it to be approximately 276.5 watts/m3. How can a fusion torus generate a 50,000 times energy than the sun, pound for pound?","The Sun’s fusion process involves the p-p chain, where the fuel is hydrogen; this is a very slow fusion process. Most fusion devices aim to use D-T fusion, where the fuel is deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen). The likelihood of this reaction occurring is much, much higher than the p-p chain. Therefore, the reaction rate in a fusion device would be orders of magnitude higher. Fusion devices also typically have plasma cores with temperatures about 10 times the solar core’s temperature."
257,Why isn't ocean phytoplankton fertilization taken more seriously and can't injecting reflective material at say the North and south pole's atmosphere be a good start to slowing this crazy heat train we're on?,"> I never hear anything about ocean fertilization.

Are you looking? Because this has been an active area of research for decades, including (1) documenting how Fe flux to the oceans may have influenced climate in the past (e.g., [Martin, 1990](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/PA005i001p00001), [Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1246848)), (2) direct experiments of the effects of Fe fertilization (e.g., [Martin & Fitzwater, 1988](https://www.nature.com/articles/331341a0), [de Baar et al., 1990](https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps/65/m065p105.pdf),  [Martin et al., 1991](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.4319/lo.1991.36.8.1793), [Martin et al., 1994](https://www.nature.com/articles/371123a0), [Hiscock & Millero, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967063705001548) and many many more, see for example reviews and syntheses by [de Baar et al., 2005](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004jc002601), [Boyd et al., 2007](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1131669), or [Yoon et al., 2018](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/15/5847/2018/)), and (3) numerical modeling of the effects of Fe fertilization (e.g., [Hannon et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967064501000169), [Pasquer et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385110104000929)). 

What the above has found is pretty mixed. Despite many Fe fertilization experiments, very few have actually found the desired effect, i.e., increased carbon removal (this is covered in the reviews by Boyd et al., 2007 and Yoon et al., 2018 linked above). What much of this work has also shown is that it likely has some pretty serious negative impacts as well. Chief among these is the so-called 'nutrient robbing' effect where by this extra phytoplankton productivity in the areas of Fe fertilization also basically draws down major nutrients for primary productivity that are usually transported (and support marine ecosystems) elsewhere (mostly low latitude, tropical areas) in the ocean (e.g., [Aumont & Bopp, 2006](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2005GB002591), [Palter et al., 2010](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/7/3549/2010/), [Hauck et al., 2016](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/024007), [Fripiat et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00836-8)). 

Climate change itself is changing various aspects of nutrient cycling and a new paper published just a few days ago considers the potential joint impact of climate change related impacts and those of ocean iron fertilization ([Tagliabue et al., 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gcb.16854)). What they show is together, the nutrient robbing effect of fertilization and climate change related changes would likely be devastating for productivity in low latitude tropical oceans, including those in economically vital fisheries AND that consistent with prior investigations, the fertilization has a pretty minor effect in terms of carbon removal. 

> Also I know shooting reflective material into the atmosphere is controversial but couldn't it be done at the poles hopefully concentrated there, helping the caps stay frozen and possibly recover some ice?

There are plenty of [solar geoengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_geoengineering) proposals that are being researched. In lieu of another literature survey like above, you end up running into similar problems. I.e., it's *very* important to do lots of experiments and investigation before implementing any intentional geoengineering so we understand the potential side effects. In most cases, the results of these suggest that many are relatively ineffective AND have significant, negative side effects (like the iron fertilization example)."
258,Why is the increase in temperature anomaly this year higher than previous years?,"It's not a complete answer, but the developing/strengthening El Niño is definitely part of the answer (e.g., [this discussion from Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/june-2023-temperature-update/) focused on the year to date up to June). As this highlights, El Niño will probably have more of an influence on 2024 than the present and the remainder of 2023, but it is making a contribution to the current conditions as well."
259,Would Earths rotation change if surface water was removed?,"Basically anything that changes the distribution of mass can change the rate of rotation (and thus length of day, which is how the amount of change is usually quantified) through conservation of angular momentum, kind of like the classic example in a physics textbook of a figure skater changing their rotation rate by extending or pulling in their arms. For example, ocean and atmospheric currents (e.g., [Gross et al., 2004](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003JB002432)), changes in distribution of water masses, like snow (e.g., [Fong Chao et al., 1987](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB092iB09p09415)), changes in sea level (e.g., [Landerer et al., 2007](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2006GL029106)), large earthquakes (e.g., [Anderson, 1974](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.186.4158.49), [Fong Chao & Gross, 1987](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/91/3/569/639639), [Fong Chao & Gross, 1995](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/122/3/776/717673)), and various geodynamic processes in Earth's interior (e.g., [Holme & de Viron, 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12282)) all either permanently or temporarily redistribute mass and thus influence rotation rates to varying degrees. So, in some hypothetical where all the water in the ocean vanished, that would definitely qualify as a change in mass distribution and would result in a change in rotation rate. The details would depend on what happened in this hypothetical, i.e., is it simply removed? Is it moved into the interior of the Earth? Etc."
260,Why does it take so long for the sun to exhaust its fuel?,"Nuclear fusion is actually not all that fast, because fusing 2 nuclei requires a very specific set of extreme conditions. And while the temperature in the core of the Sun is very high, the density isn't that great. The average density of the Sun is about a quarter of that the Earth and only in the core is the density greater than that of Earth. Note that fusion only takes place in the core of the Sun, not in the surface layers. And even at the densities and temperature in the core, the chance of 2 nuclei fusing is still very low. Most interactions don't result in a fusion event.

The fusion that does take place in the core of the Sun produces a lot of radiation and this exerts an outward pressure on the Sun, forcing it to expand outwards. On the other hand, there's the gravity working to collapse the Sun inward. If the rate of fusion in the core goes up, so does the radiation pressure, which causes the Sun to expand, lowering the density and thereby the rate of fusion. So the Sun is in an equilibrium where the radiation pressure from the fusion reaction counteracts the force of gravity. 

All things combined, this results in the power density of the core of the Sun being about [276 W/m^(3)](https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/04/17/3478276.htm), which is, supposedly, less than that of a compost heap. And considerably less than the power density of an average human (~100 W / ~0.065 m^(3)).

The Sun is a pretty inefficient power plant in terms of performance for its size. But the saving grace is that it so enormously big that even at this low power density,  the total power production is still as massive as it is."
261,Could a planet's orbit be so elliptical that the climate was impacted by the changing distance to the orbited star?,"Tackling the climate aspects of your question: 

You're correct that the seasons relate to the tilt of the Earth's axis (i.e., summer in a given hemisphere corresponds to when that hemisphere is ""facing"" the sun due to the tilt, e.g., [this diagram](https://www.weather.gov/images/cle/Education/EarthOrbit.png)), but the underlying premise that the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit has no effect on climate is wrong, at least when we consider long-term climate. Specifically, changes in eccentricity of Earth's orbit over time is one of the cycles that we consider as part of [Milankovitch cyclicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles) that modulate the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth. These combined cycles are the primary control on [glacial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacial_period) - [interglacial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interglacial) cycles during [icehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_and_icehouse_Earth) conditions (like we are currently within, see this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/climate_change_ice_age/) for further discussion of the confusing terminology around glacials, interglacials, and icehouses/ice ages).

Each of the embedded cycles have semi-constant periods and typically, in terms of the combined effect on solar radiation, one of these periods will be dominant, i.e., the timing between the major climatic shifts on Earth will roughly correspond to the timing of one of the cycles (e.g., eccentricity, obliquity, axial precession, etc.). For the last 1 million years, the ~100,000 year eccentricity cycle has actually been the dominant one, but this changes (e.g., between 1-3 million years ago, the dominant period was the ~41,000 year obliquity period). For changes in Earth's eccentricity, these are relatively small, varying between effectively circular and a little bit elliptical, basically varying between an eccentricity of 0 (circular) to 0.05 (which will still look pretty close to circular), but is still enough to change insolation (solar radiation) enough to influence climate.

I'll leave the aspects of your question about stability of highly elliptical orbits to folks with more of a background in orbital mechanics / physics."
262,"Why is it that most volcanoes on Io are low relief in nature, lacking the ability to build towering mountains like most volcanoes on Earth and Mars?","There have been a variety of explanations put forward for the formation of the Patera on Io, but I don't think there's consensus yet (someone more versed in planetary geology may correct me on that). As you mention, they share some morphological similarities with caldera on Earth (and Mars, etc), but an exact analogy between calderas on Earth and patera on Io is problematic, leading some to suggest we could consider patera as a type of caldera - as opposed to being a true caldera (e.g., [Radebaugh et al., 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2000JE001406)). As discussed in that paper, one of the big problems with explaining patera as calderas is that calderas on Earth are primarily formed by collapse after explosive, dominantly felsic (high silica) magma. In contrast, it appears that most erupted products on Io are mafic to ultramafic (low silica). One option floated by Radenbaugh et al., is that one way you could get caldera like features from a mafic or ultramafic eruption is if it was very volatile rich. On earth, the extent to which an eruption is explosive or effusive is driven both by viscosity (felsic = higher viscosity, mafic = lower viscosity) and gas content (felsic = higher gas content, mafic = lower gas content), but if you had a very ""gassy"" mafic or ultramafic magma, maybe you could still generate a large explosive eruption like those that form calderas on Earth.

Radebaugh actually goes through six different options, some others including volatiles and a few suggesting that patera may be more like extensional pull aparts (i.e., a [graben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graben)) filled with lava later. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that volcanism and patera on Io are genetically related to the non-volcanic mountains that also exist on Io (e.g., [Jaeger et al., 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002JE001946), [Kirchoff et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X10007132)) and Radebaugh emphasize the importance of considering the influence of tectonism on the morphology of the patera. The paper also highlights that there might not be *one* mechanism for all patera as there is a good amount of variety in their detailed morphology.

Alternatively, [Keszthelyi et al., 2004](https://zenodo.org/record/1259017/files/article.pdf) propose a model where (1) ascending magma encounters a volatile rich (specifically SO2 and sulfur) layer in the crust of Io and gets stuck cause it's not buoyant enough to rise through this volatile rich layer (i.e., the magma is more dense), (2) the magma starts to melt the overlying sulfur and SO2 rich material that flows laterally forming sills, (3) this progressively basically carves out a chasm (i.e., the patera) above the magma chamber, which itself may become exposed if melt supply is sufficient. 

**TL;DR** No single explanation exists for the formation of patera. Some explanations consider them sort of like weird versions of calderas that can form due to higher volatile content mafic magmas, others as more passive features that are extensional and get filled in by lava later, and others still that invoke more unique processes like the interaction of magma with an extremely volatile rich upper crust."

With carbon dioxide, the central carbon forms double bonds to each oxygen atom and thus has no lone pairs, just the two oxygens bonded to it. The farthest two things around a sphere can be apart from each other is the same in both 2D and 3D: 180 degrees apart in a linear configuration."
265,Can a double slit experiment cause two people to see different patterns?,"To ""observe"" something is a bit of a misnomer in quantum mechanics.

So no, two different people would not see different patterns."
266,"Sun exposure - 30 minutes straight under the sun versus 10 minutes under the sun but done 3 times. What is the difference, if there is one?","Spread out exposures are better.

DNA damage is constantly being repaired.

We have multiple mechanisms to repair this damage. For illustration, let's say you have 3 repair mechanisms, and it takes 10 minutes to repair damage to any one of them.

Scenario 1.

You spend 10 mins in the sun, which damages repair mechanism A. You stop under a tree for 10 minutes. Mechanisms B and C fix mechanism A. You continue, until you've been out for a total of 2 hours. End of the day, the mechanisms managed to repair each other, because there was always a backup repair mechanism.

Scenario 2.

You spend 2 hours straight in the sun. All 3 repair mechanisms have been damaged by the UV radiation. You don't have any more repair mechanisms left, but the body still remembers to kill off these damaged cells, resulting in a nasty sloughing sunburn.

Scenario 3.

You spend 2 hours straight in the sun. All 3 repair mechanisms are damaged. The cell-suicide (apoptosis) mechanism is also damaged. Some damaged cells survive and become cancer.

This is the multiple-hit hypothesis of cancer. You can take damage in many places, but if you accumulate damage to all of the repair mechanisms simultaneously, that's when cancer happens. I can't say how much of a difference a couple minutes of breaks will make, but it will probably be better than taking all of the damage continuously.

Think, what's worse, 8 drinks in 3 hours, or 8 drinks in 30 minutes? Total amount of alcohol is the same, but there's a difference.

Edit to add: Way way better than spreading out exposure, is to avoid UV exposure in the first place. Not all DNA damage can be repaired. Exposure to UV radiation always increases your cancer risk. Wear sunscreen or other types of UV mitigation."
267,[Repost with a source] Why does the earth heat up and cool down during the year?,"In terms of raw numbers, this is easily answerable with the data on that linked page. I.e., using the drop down menu on the top left, compare the signals for the world, NH (northern hemisphere), and SH (southern hemisphere). The NS and SH signals are opposite (phase shifted) patterns as expected, but we have to consider the ranges. For the NH, it varies between a min (during NH winter) of 8.4 and max (during NH summer) of 21.4 C (i.e., a range of 13 C. For the SH it varies between a min (during SH winter) of ~11.2 C and a max (during SH winter) of ~16.4 C, with a much more muted range of ~5.2 C. Thus, when you average these two out of phase signals, the one with the larger range (i.e., the NH) dominates. They'd only cancel each other out (to give you a constant average) if their ranges were the same. You can basically show this if you compare what you'd get if you just took the averages of max NH Summer & min SH Winter (~16.3 C) and max SH Summer & min NH winter (~12.4 C), which is pretty much what the world version shows.

As to why this pattern exists, it is largely related to the ocean. Specifically, the larger ocean mass and the details of ocean currents which preferentially transfer heat toward the northern hemisphere (e.g., [Feulner et al., 2013](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/18/jcli-d-12-00636.1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display), [Kang et al., 2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-014-2147-z)) with much attributed specifically to the [AMOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation). As discussed by Feulner, other effects, like differences in albedo between the Arctic and Antarctic also contribute. Differences in ocean mass likely contributes more to the differences in range, whereas differences in the average (i.e., across seasons, the northern hemisphere is warmer) relate more to the ocean currents and albedo differences."

269,Does a salty meal dehydrate you?,"When you ingest sodium, your blood stream becomes more saturated with sodium, and your kidneys sense this. You will then urinate less since your body is adapting to high sodium levels in the blood stream by retaining fluid. This is why you may feel puffy or have water retention after eating a meal high in sodium. Sodium in the blood also increases your blood volume/pressure which is why the cardiac diet is low in sodium in order to avoid high blood pressure. A salty meal doesn’t necessarily dehydrate you, you just pee less because your body is retaining more fluid."
270,"How do we measure the earth's aggregate surface temperature, and how do we eliminate statistic noise from this measurement?","There are a few different global, gridded average temperature or average temperature anomaly datasets, e.g., the ones from NOAA (e.g., [Vose et al., 2021](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL090873#grl61844-bib-0009)) or GISS (e.g., [Hansen et al., 2010](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010RG000345#rog1716-bib-0033), [Lennsen et al., 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JD029522#jgrd55486-bib-0014)), among others, which are typically the things we use to get at average global temperature or average global temperature change. The core of these come from weather station measurements, typically those within the Global Historical Climatology Network (e.g., [Peterson & Vose, 1997](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/78/12/1520-0477_1997_078_2837_aootgh_2_0_co_2.xml), [Menne et al., 2018](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/31/24/jcli-d-18-0094.1.xml)), which is a centralized set of temperature records from across the globe that have been validated and homogenized (e.g., corrections have been applied to account for different instruments or standards between original collecting bodies). The GHCN has also been shown to be effectively the same during the periods of overlap from an independent temperature network operated by the Soviet Union (e.g., [Lugina et al., 2003](https://data.ess-dive.lbl.gov/view/doi:10.3334/CDIAC/CLI.003)).

While weather stations within the GHCN are a critical part, they are not the only part. Sea surface temperatures also play a big role and these come from either ship based measurements or buoys (e.g., [Huang et al., 2017](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/30/20/jcli-d-16-0836.1.xml)). Similarly, measurements from things like ice-stations and buoys are important for accounting for remote regions like the Arctic (e.g., Vose et al., 2021 from above).

In addition to the original vetting and corrections applied in the process of the original temperature records being included in the GHCN, each of these composite datasets employ a variety of checks and data integration steps, e.g., comparing station temperature records with estimates from 'hind-cast' climate models (i.e., running climate models using known inputs from the past) and a variety of satellite observations. Finally, the weather station data is further homogenized/bias corrected and interpolated in a variety of ways (depending on which dataset we're talking about, i.e., NOAA employs a slightly different strategy than GISS, etc.) and integrated with satellite observations. As described in many of the papers cited above, each one of these global datasets undergoes a lot of scrutiny and statistical tests to estimate uncertainties and remove data artifacts.

With specific reference to the assertion that temperature records are biased because of failure to account for urban heat island (UHI) effects, this ignores that this is (1) a well recognized complication that is routinely considered and (2) something that has been studied, a lot. For inclusion in global temperature records/products, minimizing bias from these (and other issues) is a part of the homogenization steps (e.g., [Venema et al., 2012](https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/8/89/2012/) provides a nice summary of some of the strategies). Additionally, an important clarification is that if we consider temperature *change* as opposed to temperature magnitude, if we compare consistently rural to consistently urban temperature stations, the magnitude and rate of temperature change is effectively the same -even if the average temperature is higher in the urban environment (e.g., [Peterson, 2003](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/16/18/1520-0442_2003_016_2941_aouvri_2.0.co_2.xml)). Similar to the homogenization discussion, in regional records, one can certainly trace the influence of urban expansion in temperature records, but it's also relatively easy to account for (and remove) this effect to get at a largely unbiased estimation of temperature change not driven by urban heat island growth (e.g., [Ren et al., 2008](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/21/6/2007jcli1348.1.xml)). 

**TL;DR** Global temperatures and/or temperature anomalies come from gridded global products that are based on mixtures of land-based weather stations, ocean/ice based ship and bouy measurements, and satellite data. These data go through a lot of processing and homogenization to remove a variety of biases, including those potentially introduced by urban heat islands and their expansion. This is an extremely well studied problem and while there remain obvious uncertainties (as there are with basically any measurement) these are well understood and quantified."

276,Why does out field of vision increase as we approach the speed of light if special relativity exists?,"isn't it just a geometry thing? Forget speed of light or relativity for a moment, and if you just treat your eyes like a tunnel with an fov based on the geometry of the tunnel, you'll see that anything will enter if it's within a certain angle from center. As you move forward, things that would otherwise be traveling horizontally in your view, get a component towards you. The faster you travel the larger that component becomes relative to the horizontal component. Eventually the relationship between the horizontal and non horizontal component is such that the angle enters your eyes.   


In fact, even if the light is traveling from behind you forwards at an angle, that light has 2 components - a horizontal (towards your center), and a non horizontal (away from you), when you are standing still (casually speaking). As you start moving forward, the non horizontal component will increase in your direction. With stuff that isn't light, traveling much slower than the speed of light, then it basically adds like a triangle...once you get to relativistic speeds, the relationship of the 2 components still changes, but the final result is effectivity scaled down to the speed of light.   


So actually, I'd say that the FOV doesn't cap at 180 degrees, it actually approaches 360. The only light that doesn't enter your eyes is the light whose horizontal component in your view is such that it is moving away from you.   


Another thing to remember is, as you are moving, the angle a light path takes changes (which is one of the bases of the mirror thought experiment leading to special relativity), but the speed of that beam doesn't change.   


And then finally, the other geometry is: you can't see something travel faster than the speed of light, and light itself can't travel faster than the speed of light, but as long as it isn't parallel to your velocity, the speed you actually need to 'beat' to catch up is less than the speed of light so you are fine (in the pursuit of seeing it)"
277,Why did only 1g of the Hiroshima bomb go through fission?,"You misunderstood the factoid: a substantial amount of the nuclear fuel went through fission, but only about 1 gram of the fuel’s mass was converted to energy according to E = m c^2 .

Using that equivalence between mass and energy, the 13 kiloton yield of the Hiroshima bomb is equivalent to [about a gram](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%2813+kilotons+tnt%29+%2F+%28speed+of+light%29%5E2) of lost mass.

In a typical nuclear fission reaction, uranium atoms are split, and the product nuclei are more tightly bound than the original uranium.  The difference in binding energy is released into the outside world — that’s the energy of the bomb — and so the daughter nuclei weigh slightly less than the parent.  But only slightly less: all of the particles still exist, only a tiny fraction of the mass of the uranium was lost, even though a good fraction of the atoms of uranium were split.

/u/RobusEtCeleritas points out that these early bombs were inefficient, and that’s true (which is why I was vague about how much “a good fraction” is above).

279,How does evolution keep up with the need for diversity when breeding?,"It is better to think of selection has happening to a big population, not one progenitor of any one trait. A new trait obviously has to start with one individual, but it spreads through the breeding population over time and over generations. Usually this is just a diffusion process due to random breeding pairs. But in case the trait had some benefit to reproductive success, it will spread more and start to dominate. Contrariwise, if the trait has a negative effect in that local environment, it will disappear over time (in that breeding population).

So an ancestral species could have large populations occupying to geographic niches, and for some reason they aren't interbreeding. Then the variations and selection in the two subgroups are dictated by local factors and can diverge from each other over time. Eventually, they could become so different that they stop being able to produce non-sterile offspring, if indeed they are able to produce any at all, by interbreeding.

There is a classic example with lizards that generated local species in geographically distinct locations. Let's call them A, B, C, and D. Site B neighbors both A & C, and site C neighbors B & D. So you could have a situation where species B can interbreed with species A and species C, but not with species D. Similarly, species C can interbreed with both B and D, but not with A. So even though A and B can interbreed, only one of them can successfully breed with species C, which makes them distinct from each other."
280,"What did Richard Feynman mean when he said ""turbulence is the most important unsolved problem of classical physics""?","Turbulence is hard to understand because its mathematical properties make it difficult to tackle. Not just analytically, but also computationally. 

1. Turbulence is inherently non-linear. In physics, many complicated phenomena are linear, meaning that individual modes can be analyzed in isolation. (As an example, ordinary beams of light in vacuum don’t interact with each other, they propagate on their own.) This nonlinear coupling means that different modes can exchange energy with each other through different length scales, such as via the inverse cascade. While you can make headway by analyzing the linear physics, it can only tell you so much. 

1. Turbulence is a non-equilibrium phenomenon. Here, equilibrium means that the system is in a steady-state. In physics, complicated systems can be still be understood in a statistical/thermodynamic sense if the system is in equilibrium. In contrast, turbulence is a far-from-equilibrium process with changing exchanges of momentum and energy, so these equilibrium methods don’t work. 

1. Turbulence is highly chaotic with many degrees of freedom. Conventional chaos theory works well with few degrees of freedom, so its applicability to turbulence is limited. (For an example where chaos theory is useful that isn’t just a particle trajectory, I believe stochastic magnetic fields are often analyzed with chaos theory methods.) I should note this does not mean the flow is completely *random*; you can have highly ordered statistical structures amidst the chaos. Probably the most prominent example is the polygon-shaped cyclone structure on the north pole of Jupiter. See also the formation of what are called zonal flows, the most prominent example being (again) Jupiter’s bands of color. 

1. Systems that exhibit turbulence are modeled by time-dependent non-linear partial differential equations. Simply put, non-linear partial differential equations are computationally costly and hard to simulate. Only a handful of analytic solutions exist for any given system, and only for very, very simple cases; oftentimes (maybe all the time?) these solutions characterize non-turbulent laminar flow. Because the system undergoes time evolution, the goal is not just “calculate a single number to high precision” like in other fields of physics. Rather, the problem is to determine how the whole system evolves in time and how to characterize and distill the time evolution of that system in a way we can understand.


The above features are generic and apply to systems beyond the Navier-Stokes equations. (For instance, kinetic systems can exhibit turbulence and don’t suffer from what’s known as the “closure problem”.)


Scientists consider it important because turbulence is present in many systems of interest. The solar wind, the Earth’s iron core, global climate, ocean currents, aerodynamics, weather on other planets, the list goes on. Some of these are also of practical interest. From a physics standpoint, I also find it novel that it’s a purely *classical* problem and is also an emergent phenomenon. Progress in things like quantum gravity research and fundamental theories will not help you better understand turbulence, you have to meet it on its own terms."
281,Will the end of survival of the fittest have negative effects on the long term genetic health of the human population?,"Preface that this question runs very close to notions of eugenics. I'm going to assume you don't actually support that way of thinking, and approach this question like I do in the classroom. It's a topic generally pushed out of discussion (for obvious reasons) and for this reason can be somewhat uncomfortable, and I recognize that. So please keep an open mind and consider the possibility that some of the framework you used in forming this question might not be accurate.

First, ""survival of the fittest"" is a pseudoscientific concept popularized by the eugenicist Herbert Spencer, not Charles Darwin. It is not and has never been considered a legitimate tenet of modern evolutionary theory. Darwin once used the term ""survival of the fit"" (not ""fittest"") in a wider context of organisms needing to survive in order to enter the reproductive competition, but the ""fittest"" qualifier is an invention. Selection acts on differences in reproductive success when those differences correlate with some trait, not a vague approximation of how ""fit"" someone is. 

Going further, it seems that you're under the impression that natural selection no longer exists within humans, and this could not be further from the truth. There are a huge variety of measurable instances of adaptive responses by many human populations to selection pressure in modern times. The advent of modern medicine, for example, has removed the strong selective penalty on women who started having children at younger ages, and thus we've seen the age of menarche (the onset of menstruation in girls) and average age at first birth both decrease in European women over the past couple centuries. There are many other examples of this, and for obvious reasons many are related to major changes like agriculture, migrations, and modern medicine.

Next, relying on ""the system"" is one of the most foundational traits that makes us human, and is in no way a modern phenomenon of individuals or systems. Pregnant women (and their infants) have basically zero chance for survival without the aid of other people, or what you might call ""the system"". For a more pointed example, do you think you've contributed more to the world than FDR? Or Stephen Hawking? One of the great evolutionary biologists of the 20th century, Stephen Jay Gould, was twice stricken with cancer, and completely at the mercy of ""the system"" while he recovered from the first and sadly succumbed to the second. Establishing an arbitrary value judgement of genetic traits by the sum lifetime experience of the carrier is simply not a logical way to approach this, not least of which because we have 25,000+ genes and their relationship to our lives is often extremely complex and multi-faceted.

> Is there any other mechanism keeping certain traits from becoming more dominant in the gene pool?

""Dominance"" is a molecular characteristic of genes which silence the expression of other version of that gene. Frequency is what you're talking about, and the frequency of a gene increases if it lends some benefit to reproductive success or, to a lesser extent, due to random chance if it has zero effect on reproduction. The former scenario is natural selection in a nutshell, the latter is called genetic drift.

> Everyone has seen or knows of people that would not have made it if their needs weren’t met by the system.

You also fall into this category, as do we all. We are simply not solitary mammals. If you're a farmer, you rely on someone else for your plumbing. If you're a plumber, you rely on someone else for your medical care, or for car work. You rely on me for teaching you biology, but I have a life-threatening autoimmune disease, and would have died at 4 without modern pharmaceuticals and all their societal and industrial dependencies. So where do we draw the line? The closest you can get to this misguided notion of complete self-sufficiency is probably in the few remaining human hunter-gatherer populations, and if you asked them about this topic (and I have) they'll talk your ear off about how much they help and rely on each other to thrive as a community, how they never could have made it through some period without a friend or a cousin or whatnot. Bickering about the degree and specific nature which different peoples' forms of reliance takes is a pointless exercise, and historically almost always paired with an invented notions of what ""superior"" people look like. If you'd like to read further about the formal evolutionary theory involved with this notion of helping other people, you can look up kin selection, altruism, and inclusive fitness."

As the air passes these blades, some of the air's momentum is lost to them. These blades are attached to the engine's shaft, and they cause it to rotate. This shaft in turn rotates the fan at the front of the engine, which draws air through the engine and throws it out of the back. This pushes the plane forward. The shaft also powers compressors, which increase air pressure, ensure the fuel to air ratio is high, and prevent the combustion products blowing out the front of the engine.

284,Why were diseases like smallpox or influenza not already in the new world prior to colonization?,"Remember that viruses, like living organisms, evolve and all derive from earlier versions of themselves. So if you start thinking about viruses as having ""species"", ancestry, and variation (even though we do not use the former term with viruses specifically), the natural history can become a little more straightforward because we can recognize that the presence of a virus, the environmental context for its success, *and* the susceptibility of the potential host which must all be present for community transmission to occur. For example, the pathogens that decimated indigenous American populations did so not simply ""because"" they had not originated in the New World, but more strictly because those criteria above were met. Hunter-gatherer populations in Eurasia had also been majorly impacted by the pathogens characteristic of Eurasian agricultural societies, despite the fact that those HG populations had been present for much longer than the (at that time) relatively novel agriculturalists.

As to Europeans not being susceptible to New World pathogens, this is actually not the case. One of these diseases of New World-origin that you're almost certainly familiar with is syphilis. But you're correct that obviously Europe was not decimated by novel pathogens like the Americas were, and this is a multifactored problem to tease apart. Indigenous Americans did not have domesticated livestock in the style of Eurasian populations (ie, urban, high density, great environment for zoonotic transmission, etc), and this is a major contributor to the stark contrast in the natural history of infectious disease between Europeans and Indigenous Americans, both before and after colonization. Obviously Europe had generated many plagues which had decimated its own population long before the colonization of the New World, so the introduction of novel pathogens between long-separated groups isn't a necessary characteristic of epidemics.

The genetic origins of variola (which causes smallpox in humans) are not that clear, but it seems to have arisen zoonotically somewhere around the Mediterranean around 500 BCE, and there is one major division around 300 CE into an extinct lineage recovered from human remains in Scandinavia, and another lineage that is responsible for the various smallpox epidemics we're all familiar with, which spreads across the world until its elimination in 1980. Influenza is a similar story, possibly arising in China around 6000 BCE and eventually spreading West to India, Africa, and Europe. We are limited to techniques like ancient and eDNA analysis for pinning down the true origins of these pathogens, because historically speaking we really only hear about pandemics, and its clear that pathogens can maintain somewhat of an equilibrium in terms of persistence in a population and devastating epidemics, so it's not always clear that a widespread outbreak always marks the origin of a given pathogen."
285,Is reproductive compatibility a real thing?,"> I am not referring to genetic incompatibility (cause that applies to difrent species) 

Actually, you are! Genetic variation is not just something that exists between species, it very much exists within species, and humans are no exception. Now, indeed in the general case all humans are reproductively compatible with each other, but there are many instances where specific genetic factors might affect this. The more correct version of what you're thinking of here is that all *groups* of humans are genetically compatible with each other, which is to say that these factors which might increase or decrease the viability of offspring are variations observable between individuals, not groups.

The overall answer to your question is yes, there is most definitely an underlying background of genetic factors which contribute to the likelihood of successful pregnancy between a given couple who both have no observable impairments in their fertility. Without getting too jargony, this falls under what we call immunological compatibility. It involves the immune signalling proteins and glycoproteins that coat the outside of our cells, which are collectively called the major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), or sometimes human leukocyte antigens(HLA). A substantial amount of total conceptions end in spontaneous abortion, and it's thought that certain combinations of MHC/HLA variation in the potential parents give rise to this. Experimentally this is of course difficult to examine, given that we would never induce or terminate pregnancies as part of an experimental model, but lots of in vitro evidence supports this, and population data from genetic screening of couples exploring fertility therapy also lends some support.

And, just to reiterate, these instances of possibly ""unfavorable"" MHC combinations arise between couples with similar genetic background just like they do in couples of different backgrounds, so there's no basis to consider this a trend of reproductive isolation between human populations. If anything, the reverse is true, ie MHC combinations which are *too* similar seem to be worse off overall, and this makes sense evolutionarily because we (as multicellular eukaryotes) are in a constant arms race with the infectious microbial world, and the genetic reshuffling we get from sexual reproduction is a major tool we've used in this race for hundreds of millions of years."
286,Is there truth to genetic traits like height being predictable by looking at your mom’s dad?,"""Predictable"" is a fuzzy word. You inherited all of your genes from your mom and dad, without exception, so the genetic contribution to your height is 100% owed to the genes they carry and reshuffled in the process that made you. In ""big picture"" traits like body size there is also a lot of contribution in development from the environment, so of course your parents genes can't be thought to be responsible for you having enough protein and bone minerals while you were still growing, etc. However, in a population where major environmental insults to skeletal development are pretty rare (such as the developed world), we can infer a lot about height from the height of your parents. But also, of the two copies you have of each gene, you inherited one from each of your parents which was randomly selected from the two copies *they* each carried, so this means without genetic testing we only have a 50/50 guess as to which of their two copies you inherited. In biology we phrase this as meiosis (the process where sex cells are produced) being ""a fair coin"". Since body size is influenced by so many genes, and each of your parents could have had some genes which contribute to being taller and others to being shorter, we don't immediately know which from each of those pairs of genes you inherited yours.

Some traits, on the other hand, are what we call deterministic, which is to say that if you have the gene, you have the trait. Blood type and many other small-scale, molecular traits of cellular biology fall into this bucket. If you've ever done Punnett squares in a bio class, that's what you were doing: predicting the likelihood of a trait with clear-cut, deterministic inheritance patterns.

The ""this gene from your dad's mom, that gene from your mom's dad"" etc thing is a myth. All of your genes came from one of your parents. Now, there are definitely genes whose expression is influenced by things like sex and homozygosity (how many of your genes are identical across the two copies you have), so talking about phenotypes (expressed traits) can involve wider family history like that. Specifically with regards to height, there is also the relevance of a statistical phenomenon called regression towards the mean, which basically states that the further you go from the mean value (which in this case would be average height), the more likely your offspring are to be closer to that mean value than you, since it took both the right genes *and* some pretty lucky environmental factors to be so far from the mean. You might have heard the phrase that very tall people tend to be taller than their parents, but very tall parents tend to have children shorter than them. This phrase is evoking the reality of regression towards the mean."
287,Would smoke from a large fire in an urban area still be able to rise into the sky even when it's storming?,"Rain is fantastic for smoke emissions.

Air pollution in any city drops during and immediately after a rain storm.

It starts a process called ""wet deposition"".  Particles and gases from the fire are captured by water droplets and delivered back to the surface.

So we know that rain captures smoke and stops it spreading into the atmosphere.  That's great for the air quality we breathe.

But what happens to the smoke *stuff* that is now in the water.  Does it make a puddle of smoke-stuff? 

Large enough rain event and nothing changes.  Any smoke pollution is massively diluted to be unnoticeable in further surface waters.

Locally, [wet deposition can cause ""acid rain""](https://www.epa.gov/acidrain/what-acid-rain).  This is most visible in the emissions footprint of a large continuous emitter such as a coal fired power plant.  However, the same effect can happen after a sufficiently large wildfire.

The worst environmental case is heavy clouds and NOT raining.  Smoke and gases get trapped as if under a heavy lid.  They cannot go up, so they spread out as well as concentrating in the immediate area.  Compare this to historical London fog, or general smog in any large city.

And the absolute worst case for large atmospheric emissions is a weather phenomenon called *[atmospheric inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_\(meteorology\))*

This came up recently in [Ohio when there was a train derailment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2023/02/22/air-pollution-disaster-that-echoes-ohio-train-derailment/) of hazardous chemicals.  Those chemicals were definitely 100% going to catch on fire or explode.  However, in a few days there would be an atmospheric inversion and the gases would remain near ground level.  A problem.

> Seventy-five years ago, a temperature inversion became the center of the worst air pollution disaster in U.S. history. In October 1948, a layer of cold air functioned as a lid, preventing warmer air from escaping the bowl-shaped valley of the Monongahela River. Industrial pollution trapped in the valley spawned a “Killer Smog” over Donora, Pa."
288,What’s the true color of the sun?,"Excellent article over here by NASA:  


[https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/what-color-sun](https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/what-color-sun)

&#x200B;

A couple of highlights:

* The sun emits light at all wavelengths (colors), but most strongly at around 500 nm (blue-green).
* The color that we perceive the sun to be depends on whether we observe the sun from the surface of the Earth (beneath the atmosphere), or from space (above the atmosphere).
* If we observe the sun from space, the sun will appear to be white. This is because we are observing all of the sun's individual colors combined together into white light.
* If we observe the sun from the surface of the earth or beneath the atmosphere, the atmosphere tends to scatter blue light. This means that less blue light gets to your eyes to see, and so the sun appears more toward the yellow and orange end of the spectrum."
289,How are cleanrooms kept perpetually clean?,"A lot of filters in ventilation which also has a higher static pressure than atmosphere so if there are any gaps or seams that lead into the clean room, they get pushed out.

A lot of them require body suits to trap skin particles and hair inside the suit and then you step through a chamber that blows/sucks whatever debris is on the outside of the suit away to prevent contamination.

Iirc there are different levels of clean room based on what activities might be performed there."
290,Do all the world's oceans mix?,"Yes, on sufficiently large timescales- provided that it isn't something that's affected by biochemical cycling.

What u/funwithdesign says regarding the ocean being sectioned off by currents is true to an extent, but surface and deep water do mix, and the whole thing cycles on a thousand year (or so) timescale. There have been studies on ocean mixing, since surface currents and water exchange with the deep ocean have a profound effect on both local and global climate. It turns out that radioactive isotopes (from nuclear testing) are good tracers for this kind of thing.

I encourage you to search for AMOC- the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Curculation- and the older name for it, ""thermohaline circulation"" to explore the topic of ocean mixing."

292,"In a toaster, the metal wire becomes so hot that it glows. Could this phenomenon be used to create a lightbulb?","Yes. And it has been used to create a lightbulb. The venerable tungsten lightbulb that was pretty much everywhere until it was replaced by more power efficient light sources in the last two decades.

A classical lightbulb contains a tungsten wire that current runs through. The current heats up the wire until it gets hot enough to glow and that's where the light comes from.

The problem with this type of lightbulb is that most of the energy is turned into heat and only a small portion ends up as light. Modern light sources, such as LEDs, convert a far greater fraction of the energy into light."
293,I have been watching YouTube videos about The Demon Core. Could anyone help out with some questions I have?,">Q1: Why wouldn't this container also cause criticality? Surly the point of the container is to prevent radiation from ""leaking out"" so why wasn't it also causing nutrons to reflect back into the core.

Criticality is extremely sensitive to both the material and the geometry. Lead is a good shield (particularly for photons rather than neutrons), but it's not a very good moderator. And the geometry is not necessarily the same between shielding and a reflector.

>Q2 If a container is necessary to prevent exposure how were the scientists able to move the core from the container to the experiment's equipment, i.e. the hemupheres. 

Things like that can be controlled remotely. Or in the case of a critical assembly, the dose rate might not be very high when the system is not near criticality. So each part can be held individually without shielding, and only when they're precisely assembled in a near-critical state does the dose rate become appreciable.

>Q3 Is the amount of exposure from the core, in the timeframe of preparing and performing the experiment acceptable? (Q3.1) If the core was sitting in a table in a room, could I walk into the room, and sit at the table without serious exposure? Logic tells me this must be the case because scientists and assistants were doing exactly that, and everyone seemed to know that it was safe to be in the room during the experiments.

Yes, if it's not near criticality.

>Q4 As the core reached criticality does the amount of radiation increase steadily , or does it remain at a safe (acceptable) level right up until the point of criticality where it spikes massively?

It all depends on the specifics of the setup in question and what's considered ""acceptable"". As the system approaches criticality from below, the dose rate will increase. [More details here](https://www.nuclear-power.com/nuclear-power/reactor-physics/reactor-dynamics/subcritical-multiplication/).

>Q5. (The last one. Thank you for your patience). If the complete closure of the two hemispheres cause criticality, due to the reflection of the nutrons, why do those same spheres not prevent the radiation from ""getting out"". It seems contradictory to have total reflection and radiation leakage.

It's not *total* reflection, it's just *enough* reflection that on average, each fission neutron induces at least one more fission reaction. There are still plenty of neutrons which don't induce fission, and/or escape the critical assembly entirely."
294,Can you trace a rock back to its quarry of origin?,"Usually, but the degree of specificity depends on the details. Generally, the bulk chemistry of the rock, the mineral makeup of a rock, chemistry of individual minerals within the rock (or of the mineral if the sample is a single mineral), and/or the age of either the rock or sets of minerals within the rock can be used, either alone or in concert to some degree, to reconstruct the ""provenance"" of rocks (and this is true whether we're considering this in a more geologic context or an archaeology one). 

A good example of this from archaeology is using the bulk chemistry of objects crafted out of obsidian to trace their origins to particular volcanoes or volcanic regions (e.g., [Negash & Shackley, 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1475-4754.2006.00239.x), [Mulrooney et al., 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/arco.5069), [Pierce, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278416515000859), [Grebennikov & Kuzmin, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618215303153) - see review of the technique in [Glascock, 2020](https://www.sci-cult.com/wp-content/uploads/6.2/6_2_4_Glascock.pdf)) or alternatively using the radiometric age and geochemistry of obsidian together (e.g., [Vogel et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440306000719)). This type of data is incredibly useful for understanding things like ancient trade routes (e.g., [Yacobaccio et al., 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440303001146), [Eerkens et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440307001070), [Connolly et al., 2015](http://npshistory.com/publications/usfs/newberry/tgpn-2015.pdf), [Santi et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-022-01527-0)).

The extent to which these provenance methods uniquely reveal the location of sourcing depends on the how ""unique"" the signature (or combination of signatures) within the object/source are, which may vary by technique, but also depends on how well characterized potential sources are, i.e., you need things to match the measurements of the object against. In some cases, based on what's available in the sense of which techniques are appropriate (not all methods are going to be as useful depending on the type of rock/mineral in question), you can still be left with ambiguity. In other cases, you can narrow it down to a very specific site. An example of the latter is something like Stonehenge, where geochemistry, ages, and various mineralogical features have allowed very specific sourcing of the rocks used for different parts of the structure, in some cases down to individual outcrops (e.g., [Bevins et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440320301102), [Bevins et al., 2021a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21002959), [Bevins et al., 2021b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X21000389))."
295,"How hot does Peat, Lignite, Bituminous Coal, and Anthracite burn?","There is no specific answer to this question; certainly there isn't a single unique number.

For example, [this study of 24 lignite samples from Turkey](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00908310600712224?scroll=top&needAccess=true&role=tab) found ignition temperatures from 183&deg;C to 276&deg;C and peak temperatures from 340&deg;C to 533&deg;C. This is from samples all having the same mass, processed in the exact same way, provided with the same amount of oxidizer.  (And no, the sample with the highest ignition temperature was not the same sample with the highest peak temperature.) Ignition and combustion temperatures are variable not only by overall category of coal, but by specific combustion conditions (especially how much oxygen/oxidizer is provided).

If you're asking for a specific reason, it would be easier to give you representative answers, but as you can see, at least for lignite, ""burning temperature"" spans nearly 200&deg;C."
296,Measuring the One-way Speed of Light?,"This is actually an example of a very classic thought experiment used in courses on relativity.

The core issue in these thought experiments is that they assume that the rod is perfectly rigid - when you push one end of the rod, the other end moves instantly. However, this in itself would count as faster-than-light motion!

What actually happens is that there is no such thing as a perfectly rigid rod - instead, when you push one end of the rod, you just push the molecules you are touching. Those molecules bump into adjacent molecules and push them too, and those push the next molecules, and so on and so on up the rod. You have a pulse or wave of momentum that travels along the rod at a finite speed until the far end of the rod eventually gets pushed. This turns out to be way slower than the speed of light - it's actually the speed of *sound* within that rod.

So you press a button, which fires the laser, and also pushes the rod in order to press the button that starts the clock. The clock has a laser receiver, and stops counting once it receives the laser pulse. The order of events is then:

1. The button is pushed, the laser is launched, the rod is pushed
2. The laser beam is received by the clock's detector, which hasn't started yet. The ""pulse"" of ""push"" is still moving along the rod
3. The rod pushes the other button, starting the clock.

This is the common thing to look out for in anything that appears to get around the rules of relativity, travel through time or whatever - usually there's a hidden way that they're breaking the speed of light, such as assuming a perfectly rigid rod or disc."
297,What do plants use to grow?,"The green parts of plants, especially the leaves,  contain microscopic structures called chloroplasts that uses some pretty complicated (and impressive) chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar (glucose) and oxygen in the presence of sunlight. The carbon dioxide comes from the air, and the water comes from (usually) the soil (sometimes from ambient humidity but this is a very small amount). The sugar gets transported down to the roots, which perform other chemical reactions to convert that sugar into other chemical structures that the plant can use for all the other functions, and build new components from. The roots also absorb other nutrients and elements, like nitrogen, phosphorous, etc. from the soil.

When a plant is just a seed, it has everything spring-loaded inside to start a baby plant, all it needs is water to unlock these first transformations to put out its first baby roots and baby stem, and as soon as the seedling grows up above the soil line, the sunlight “turns on” the chloroplasts, which then turn on the rest of the factory. 

You do technically lose mass from soil, but it’s at a very slow rate, almost too slow to observe in a pot, and in nature, soil is constantly being replenished and added to from other organisms. In truth, soil is mostly a physical structure  that holds the plant in place; it’s the nutrient-rich water that percolates between soil particles that feeds the plant."
298,Where is it possible to find Earth surface geometry data?,"I'm going to guess by ""geometrical info for the surface of the Earth"" you mean topography? By far the most standard way this data is available is as digital elevation models (DEMs) which are gridded rasters where each ""pixel"" in the raster stores the bare earth elevation representative of the footprint of that pixel. DEMs are distinct from digital surface models (DSMs), where DSMs are typically also rasters storing single elevation values representative of that pixel, but where that elevation includes buildings, trees, etc. There are also digital terrain models (DTMs), but this is *usually* just another way of referring to a bare earth DEM. A variety of global and regional DEMs exist with a wide array of resolutions (i.e., pixel footprint size). A pretty commonly used global one is SRTM (shuttle radar topography mission) that is released with either a nominal 90 m or 30 m grid size, but there are a variety of others (ALOS, Copernicus, etc.). There are some global DSMs as well (e.g., the Copernicus data is releases as either a DSM or a bare earth DEM where ""non-ground"" data has been removed/patched). Whether a DEM or DSM, these are usually provided in one of a few different file formats, typically GeoTIFFs. GeoTIFFs can be converted to stl files in a variety of programs.

In terms of actual point clouds, it's uncommon to release global data this way. There are specific areas for which lidar surveys have been done where point cloud data is available, but it's still more common to access the gridded DEM or DSM produced from those point clouds. 

There are lots of different data clearinghouses for these datasets. A convenient one that has both global and regional gridded and point cloud datasets is [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/dataCatalog?group=global)."
299,"how long do germs last? on a surface, airborne, or just in general?","It depends on the germ and if it lands on  a surface that’s conducive to its survival. Brass, silver and other metals have antibacterial properties so you can assume that if they aren’t visible dirty then they are relatively clean. Some germs make spores and can literally survive 1000s of years in the most inhospitable environment. The common cold virus can live around 25 hours on a hard surface like a table. Hepatitis C can live 6ish weeks. HIV can live several hours. Most germs can survive a few days to a few weeks on hard surfaces. Another thing to consider is the load you’re being exposed to. A single HIV virus is extremely unlikely to infect you with HIV while one drop of hepatitis C infected blood in a swimming pool contaminates the entire pool."
300,What are diamonds so hard?,"The carbon–carbon covalent (electron-sharing) bond is stable and strong.

The covalent bond is directional; there's a particular favorable structural orientation, and the atoms tend to arrange in this orientation and stay there.

In contrast to graphite, diamond comprises a 3D network structure (called, hey, [diamond cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_cubic)), so the above characteristics apply in all directions.

[Dislocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dislocation) (i.e., 1D defects that direct stresses to break only a few bonds at a time, enabling slip) don't readily move in diamond's 3D structure as they do in ductile metals with more accessible [slip systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_\(materials_science\)). Thus, increasing the strain energy stored in a diamond leads not to [plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_\(physics\)) ([softness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness)) but to brittle fracture—Nature essentially directs this energy into creating new surfaces."

303,What happened in the universe before the Big Bang? Was it just an empty void for however many years?,"The simple answer is we don’t know at the moment, but with e.g. studies of the gravitational wave background there are ideas to measure this in the future.

Information travels with the speed of light. When we look into the sky the farther away something is the more time has passed between the light being emitted and us seeing it. This allows us to look into the history of our universe by looking farther into the distance.

So far we have mainly looked at the early universe through the electromagnetic radiation (radio waves / microwave background). But there is a limit how far into the past we can look with this as the universe used to be extremely bright an opaque when it was very dense and hot.
Together with observations of the current universe (structure, composition, expansion) these are the measurements that constrain our Models of the early universe (e.g. ΛCDM model). This tells us the universe has expanded and was much more dense and hot. We can look at extrapolations of these models closer to the Big Bang and beyond to get some hints what might have been before.

As the early universe after the Big Bang was opaque to electromagnetic radiation but probably transparent for gravitational waves we hope to get data from farther back. Just a few days ago some first measurements of a gravitational wave background from the early universe have been published (nanoGRAV pulsar timing array, doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/acdac6).

305,"When the solar system formed, why didn't the heavier elements accumulate at the center, instead of the lightest ones like hydrogen and helium?","The center is only the center because that's where the most material coalesced to create a gravity well. Before that happened, the solar system was a pretty evenly distributed mass of gases and heavy elements.

Slight variations in the distribution of that cloud meant that parts of it condensed together due to gravity, and then drew in more elements, and so on.

Eventually, enough hydrogen and helium collected to ignite a fusion reaction, which made the sun. But it's sort of backwards to say that hydrogen and helium fell to the center. It's more accurate to say that the center is defined as wherever the most hydrogen and helium (and everything else) went.

You're also failing to grasp the scale of the sun. Yes, the sun is 99.9% hydrogen and helium, but the other 0.1% is heavier elements.

That 0.1% weighs more than Jupiter (which is also mostly gaseous). I haven't run the exact numbers, but it seems likely that there is more metal and other heavy elements in the core of the Sun than in the entire rest of the solar system combined.

Edit: did the math.

* Sun: 0.1% heavier materials (1.99E27 kg) *edit: this number might be as high as 2%*
* All inner planets and asteroid belt combined: 1.18E25 kg
* Gas planets: \~8% heavy elements (2.13 E26 kg)
* **Total heavy elements in the sun: 1.99E27 kg**
* **Total heavy elements in the rest of the solar system: 2.25E26kg**

So even using some pretty rough numbers, there's 10 times *(possibly up to 2000 times)* as much heavy material in the Sun as in the entire rest of the solar system."
306,How did we get to the exact speed of light as we know it?,"The first guy to come up with a number used the difference between when he saw an occultation or eclipses of moons (moon got blocked by the planet or something else that could be predicted by Newton laws of motion) around Jupiter that were later than expected (by many seconds) when the planet was far away compared to when closer.  Knowing the orbital behavior of both earth and jupiter gave him a distance number, and he had the time delay, so that gave a rate to cover the difference in distance.  It was fairly close, actually, order of magnitude (midway between 2 and 3 hundred thousand kilometers per second isn't all that bad for primitive work when the ""true"" value is just under 3 hundred thousand).

If you have enough distance between a source location and a mirror that sends that light back, and you have a system that blocks the light from here to the mirror at a measurable frequency, you can establish the speed of light by adjust frequency of light blocking rate until you see the light coming back from the mirror at the same time that a new pulse is being sent (see the light in the mirror through the same hole you are letting light go to the mirror and the rate is fast enough that you know it isn't this now-passing light that you see in the mirror).  The time between openings would then equal the time to go to the mirror and come back (or some integer multiple of that, because maybe that light you see is from two or three openings back rather than the one just before).  If you know the distance from here to the mirror, and the amount of time it takes to go there and get back, you can calculate the speed.

The precision of this method is not great (better than the planet guy's measurements though), because you have to know both the timing of the pulses, the distance of travel, and the gap width very well.  Still good enough for coming pretty darn close if the distance of travel is pretty far so the rate of repeating signal can also be defined fairly precisely (does not have to be too fast that measuring it is difficult) and the gap can be big enough to get a useful measurement).

More detail can be obtained by using monochrome (single wavelength) light and using the interference patterns that form when the light from two different pathways is in synch to establish speed (the paths will only perfectly interfere when the difference in distance is a perfect integer multiple of the wavelength). Do that for different distance differences and you can establish wavelength very precisely and use the change in distance against wavelength to establish rate.  Plus a bit of uncertainty in when you decide the best rate is (you will have to adjust rate slightly to maximize the return light, get it at the ""best"" result without slowly drifting out).

If you know the wavelength, and the differences in distance of travel, you know that the interference pattern will only maximize when the difference is an integer multiple of wavelength.

A lot of the ""ideal"" values used for science, for pretty much everything, comes from extrapolation of linear relationships when using ""almost ideal"" conditions.  When you get very close to the ideal condition, the limit value for all measurements in the nearly ideal condition will be the value you would get if you could do an ideal measurement.  After a bunch of  measurements at different amounts of almost vacuum, you can plot the results and the y intercept of the line will be what you would expect if you had a zero vacuum, even if you can never get a zero vacuum, you can get pretty close.

Most of the values we use for scientific constants are not actually ever obtained from pure systems, because we can't get pure systems.  However, we can get ""almost pure"" and small differences in those purities, and see the linear relationship that applies, and then the ""Pure"" system is where the line crosses zero, even if we never have an actual zero measurement.  Most things only behave as a line when VERY close to pure though.  Almost ideal."

1. House the camera in a vessel that withstands the pressure and has a clear viewing window for the camera, or-
2. Build the camera with non-pressure sensitive electronics and fill it with a non- conductive fluid (such as mineral oil) so that there are no internal pressure fluctuations that would damage the components as the pressure changes with depth.  

Underwater cameras, as well as cameras used in outer space, have been built both ways."
309,How do prions misfold other proteins?,"The answer to your question depends on how much detail you require to be an adequate explanation, but please consider the following possible answers to your question (in increasing level of detail):

1. A prion is a misfolded protein (which you know) that also exists in a correctly folded conformation in the host. When a prion comes into contact with such proteins, it acts as a template to induce a conformation change in the host protein resulting in it assuming the misfolded conformation. These changes then progress in a catalytic like manner resulting in massive changes in conformation with a resulting toxic effect on the host.
2. In somewhat more detail, please see the link below, which provides a brief, more more detailed review of the subject (along with the effects of protein folding in other disease states). Scroll down to the middle to read the portion specific to prions.

310,When will vulcanism and tectonic movement on earth end?,"A lot depends on the exact rate of cooling, but it's less about the crust thickening and more about the mantle becoming too cool for tectonics to continue. Based on at least one model, the mantle is expected to cool to the point where tectonics like we see on Earth today will stop around 0.9 billion years in the future ([Sleep, 2007](http://lunar.earth.northwestern.edu/courses/438/treatise.pdf)). That basically overlaps with [estimations of when all but single cellular life on Earth will die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_far_future)."
311,Was the universe uniform prior to expansion?,"No. There are *extremely small* [quantum fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation) in density/temperature, which were enhanced during/by inflation. Basically, there is very small randomness due to quantum mechanics, and the density distribution during inflation was essentially 'frozen in.'

Side note because the terminology is confusion, there are two separate similar terms: **expansion** and **inflation**. Colloquially they have similar meanings, but in the context of cosmology they are different.

* Expansion just refers to, well, expansion. We can measure it in various ways, and by fitting data to models have a pretty good idea of the expansion rate going back to just after inflation ended.
* [Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)) is a period of extremely rapid expansion just after the Big Bang.  In a fraction of a second (much shorter than any timescale we can measure) the Universe multiplied in scale many times. This was initially devised as a mechanism to resolve several issues unexplained by the standard cosmological model, including the fact that the early Universe (even after inflation) is very uniform -- this is referred to as the 'horizon problem'. There are some observables predicted that we can use to test inflationary theories, but they are tough and current results are inconclusive."

313,Remembering narrative story vs bullet points?,"I've no evidence of this so take this as a grain of salt.
I'd only use bullet points for company presentations (biopharma here) for listing advantages why your research is important at the start and for conclusions at the end. Never more than 2 sets of 3-5 points in ~7 words each. It should be concise and free of clutter.

In academia I see a lot of people using too many words on slides. Most go from a clear intro (narrative) with images and then dive into the science and show graphs or tables and/or text without a narrative, or even a logical link to the intro at all.

If you shape your presentation like a story, your initial results, setbacks, and new results can be depicted in graphs most of the time without bullet points and with very few words on a slide at all. Keep the depicted data as minimalistic as possible.

The audience can listen to your story and see the evidence at a glance, they need not interpret/read much from the slides except what you want them to see.

 They should keep their attention on you. A slideshow is not a handheld for the presenter. It's a tool to show your audience something extra to back up your story."

317,Can someone help me understand Glaciers and their effects on the landscape?,">1.Is this bad?

I'm going to guess you mean is the calving (breaking off of ice chunks into water) of the glacier and/or the melting of the glacier bad? In general, we'd expect a glacier that is terminating in a body of water to have ice chunks calving off, but the broader context of this and the majority of other glaciers in this part of Alaska is that they are retreating (i.e., getting smaller), mostly related to climate change (e.g., [Arendt et al., 2006](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JF000436), [Kargel et al., 2014](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-79818-7_13)).

> 2.Why does it look like a river?

Because it basically is. Most glaciers flow down hill, effectively like a river, just a lot slower. In a simple sense, flow in ice is sort of like laminar flow in a very viscous fluid (though in detail, it's better approximated as a [viscoelastic material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity), e.g., [Staroszczyk, 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03038-4_3)). To give you an idea of rates, [Burgess et al., 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3146) estimated the rates of this exact glacier (Figure 1, it's the one draining into the open area with the word ""Bering"" on it) and at the time they measured it, it has a surface velocity of 0.5-1 meter per day.

> 3.Why is the water so undisturbed?

Because it's draining into a lake, though looking at the [satellite image](https://earth.google.com/web/@60.1432182,-143.11321921,47.62914384a,100313.1959079d,35y,-0h,0t,0r) highlights it's a lake with an outlet to the ocean. Generally though, we'd expect a small body of water like this to be relatively calm in the absence of a large storm.

> 4.Where did all this (frozen)water come from initially?

Uphill/upstream, mostly. Again, you can think of a glacier is a river of ice reflecting deposition and transport/flow of snow and ice over a catchment area, just like a river and it's respective catchment area collecting liquid water."
318,How exactly does the body know when it's time to sweat?,"The hypothalamus, located in the brain, is the body’s thermoregulatory center. Once it detects that your body temperature has deviated from homeostasis through [temperature sensitive neurons](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616255114), it secretes endocrine hormones to regulate the body’s temperature. So it appears the thermal to chemical energy conversion occurs in through the neurons themselves."
319,Does hot air still hold more water if the density is kept constant?,"This is a common misconception. The air doesn’t “hold” water. And there isn’t “more space” for water in hotter air.

The real explanation comes from simply looking at the equilibrium between the liquid and gaseous water phases. At higher temperatures the vapour pressure above the water is higher. So warmer conditions leads to more water in the gas phase.

Your chamber experiment: if there was liquid water in the chamber and you heated both the liquid and the gas phase then yes the vapour pressure of the water increases. There will be an increase in pressure but this would have a almost negligible effect on the vapour pressure of the water. The increased pressure would slightly increase the vapour pressure."
320,"Lake Manicouagan formed after a meteorite impact. Why does it look ""inverted""?","For small/less energetic impacts, your conception is right, i.e., it will look largely like a bowl. But, as the size/energy of the impact increases, you tend to get various forms of [complex craters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_crater). One hallmark of these are ""central peaks"", e.g., [this cross-section comparing a simple vs complex crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_crater#/media/File:Craterstructure.gif). As impact size/energy increases, this central peak can actually become a ring itself, forming a [peak ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_ring) crater, though the particular example posted here appears to just be a very eroded version of a central peak crater. Both central peaks and peak rings are thought to basically represent collapse/flow of material from the walls of the initial crater that is formed (which is narrower and deeper than the final crater) into the center of the crater. The models in this [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aah6561) (or [non-paywalled pre-print here](https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/516086/1/Morgan_et_al_final-submitted.pdf)), specifically figure 1, might help you visualize this. Impacts like this impart *a lot* of energy, so basically everything is kind of behaving like a fluid, so you can almost think of this as the material collapsing from the walls, widening the crater, and flowing into the center forming a mound and where it kind of ""freezes"" in place. Even in simple analogue models, we can see similar things happen, e.g., [these ""impact"" models](https://blogs.agu.org/thefield/2021/04/06/central-peak-formation-in-model-impact-craters/) from dropping small weights onto sand piles can produce impact craters with central peaks."
321,How do mirrors work?,"I think your interpretation of how a mirror works is correct. 

&#x200B;

The photon generated via interaction with a (perfect) mirror has a polarisation that is determined by the polarisation of the incident photon. (Note that the reflected photon has opposite polarisation to the incident photon, if we're being particular here).

&#x200B;

The polarisation of the incident photon is entangled with the other entangled photon, so the polarisation of the reflected photon must be entangled too. 

&#x200B;

This is under the assumption that zero momentum is transferred to the mirror. In the real world, the photon transfers energy to the mirror, and there will be a loss of coherence. This depends on the mass of the mirror with respect to the photon's mass -- usually this ratio is so large that we can just ignore it, but technically there is a small loss of coherence through this interaciton."
322,"As the universe cools, will any of the present four forces decouple?","No. In a universe where everything is very cold, magnetism from moving electric charges becomes negligible, but the spin of particles doesn't depend on temperature so it stays around.

It won't be very cold everywhere until the last black holes evaporate, which is ~10^100 years away.

Inflation was a very short phase in the early universe, it doesn't exist any more. Expansion and inflation are different things."
323,What is the meaning of the Planck mass?,"As [initially defined by Planck in 1899](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/93034#page/538/mode/1up) on the last two pages of a paper he wrote attempting (and failing) to fully explain the behavior of [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation), the actual intent behind the [Planck units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units) of measurement is not to define ""the smallest meaningful measure of X."" At the time, it was pretty much just a nifty little thing that Planck realized he could do with some of the constants used in his formulas.

Keep in mind that in 1899, the definition of a second would still have been based on the length of a day on Earth. The kilogram and meter were defined by physical prototypes made of metal, but their original definitions stemmed from the density of water and the size of the Earth, respectively. The Celsius was defined by the behavior of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure.

In [the paragraphs immediately preceding](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/93034#page/537/mode/1up) the actual formulas that define the units (the section titled ""26. Naturliche Maasseinheiten""), Planck basically says ""the units we use today are all arbitrarily derived from natural phenomena on this specific planet, so they're not truly 'universal' units of measure. But hey, I could use some of the constants used earlier in my paper to create a new set of units that *are* universal!""

So, as written in that 1899 paper, the Planck units are little more than an academic exercise in creating arbitrary units of measure (length, mass, time, temperature) that are mathematically defined using only some [universal constants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant). In the case of the Planck units used today (which are actually different than the units initially proposed by Planck - see the note under ""reduced Planck constant""), those constants are:

* the [speed of light in a vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light), *c*
* the [gravitational constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant), *G*
   * Planck uses the symbol *f* in his paper
* the [reduced Planck constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant#Reduced_Planck_constant), ℏ
   * In the 1899 paper, Planck uses the regular Planck constant (*h*, but in the paper Planck calls it *b*) and not the **reduced** Planck constant (which is equal to the Planck constant divided by 2π), so [all of the units he proposes in that paper are actually sqrt(2π) bigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#History_and_definition) (or about 2.5x bigger) than the Planck units used today. The OG definition of the Planck mass was actually 55.6 micrograms.
* the [Boltzmann constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_constant), *kB*
   * That should be a subscripted B, but I can't get that to work on Reddit
   * As far as I can tell, the constant called ""*a*"" in Planck's paper isn't actually the Boltzmann constant *per se*, but something like *h*/*kB*

Also, [the equations used to define the Planck units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#History_and_definition) make it so that the value of all of those universal constants is 1 if expressed in terms of Planck units. As a practical matter, if you're doing a lot of calculations or writing formulas that involve a lot of the 4 universal constants that define the Planck units (such as in particle physics), if you use Planck units instead of, say, SI units, you can just omit all of those constants, because then they all have a value of 1.

* Side note: The Planck units are one of several systems of [natural units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units) that all do similar things, in that they use various combinations of universal constants to derive their own arbitrary units of measure, where, again, whichever constants that were used to derive the units of measure will all be 1 if expressed in those units of measure.

Ultimately, any discoveries about the ""significance"" or ""meaning"" of any of the Planck units appear to be one or more of:

1. things that were discovered *after* Planck proposed those units (theories of physics have come quite a long way since 1899, after all)
2. things that are derived from the properties or meanings of the constants themselves
3. pop-sci misunderstandings of the ""meanings"" of these units of measure posited in scientific papers (though I definitely don't know advanced physics well enough to weigh in on that)

It's also worth noting that Planck's original definitions of the Planck units predates a *ton* of modern physics, such as the realization that electromagnetic radiation is quantized (1905), the theory of general relativity (1915), the concept of a Schwarzschild radius (1916), and all the subsequent work through the 1960s and 1970s to show that black holes were a real thing and not just a mathematical quirk of the formulas of general relativity - it's not like Planck had black holes in mind when coming up with these units.

**tl;dr** the current-day Planck mass is 21.76 micrograms because that just happened to be the number you get when you take the square root of ℏ*c*/*G* to get a unit of measure for mass. Maybe someone discovers later that 21.76 micrograms has some fundamental physical meaning as we continue to refine our theories of physics, but that meaning is not baked into the definition of a Planck mass."
324,What is the difference between a major sprain and a torn ligament? Are they interchangeable terms?,"While sprains and torn ligaments(the fibrous tissue that connects one bone to another, usually across a joint line) are often used interchangeably in normal conversation, in medicine ""Sprains"" are a spectrum of ligamental injury *generally* graded as Grades 1-3 with the specific joint involved and the degree of injury guiding the treatment recommenations. This can vary from RICE-ing it (rest, ice, compression, elevation) to full blown surgical repair. 

* Grade 1 sprain (mild):  Slight stretching and some damage to the fibers of the ligament.

* Grade 2 sprain (moderate):  Partial tearing of the ligament. There is abnormal looseness (laxity) in the joint when it is moved in certain ways.

* Grade 3 sprain (severe):  Complete tear of the ligament. This may cause significant instability.

These are the general classifications outside of Orthopedics. I say that because *within* the world of orthopedic surgery, there are a myriad of very specific classification systems for various injuries to various joints and a really annoying number of eponymous for many.

The term is most likely traditional, coming from some industry that uses it a lot and has called it that for ages even though something like “sodium pyrogallate” might make more sense. 
Also, usually that type of terminology is used for carboxylic acids like benzoic acid and sodium benzoate, but pyrogallic acid isn’t a carboxylic acid so calling the conjugate base “pyrogallate” may not be chemically appropriate."

328,What happens if a grid has too much electricity?,"It depends if it’s a small or large deviation. 

For small deviations, the stuff you see day to day, the grid frequency goes up or down slightly as load vs generation mismatch changes. 

An oversupply means a slight increase in frequency (like less than 0.01 hz). This increases the speed of rotating elements and the work that they do. It also slightly affects VARs and losses through your transmission system. All together the system stabilizes with little or no response required. Day to day / hour to hour frequency drift works like this. 

If these deviations are getting big enough (still less than 0.05 hz over nominal), as frequency goes up, your grid operators may dispatch some units to come offline. Power pricing will go down or even negative especially around the areas of oversupply. Generators will come down to respond to grid pricing. Lines may be shifted. Loads may be put on service. This is all done. Primarily by the grid operator. 

As deviations go up the other thing is your generators that are in load following mode will proportionally reduce their output based on the over frequency. Most of the grid operates on a 5% droop setting, which means a 5% increase in frequency deviation results in a 100% decrease in output. So a 1% increase in frequency deviation will automatically result in a 20% decrease in output. Not all generators operate in this mode. Larger units like my nuclear plant have our droop setting above everyone else so that we don’t start to see generator output change until there is already a 0.5% over frequency. 

For rapid or large load drops that’s when you start to see protection schemes kick in. Many plants have over frequency protection systems in place. Your volt/hz protection may trip the unit. At higher frequencies the generators will droop out. For rapid changes you can trigger power/load unbalance protection or even have a generator lockout. 

Grid operators will schedule or dispatch units to make adjustments as necessary throughout the day. If something unexpected happens like major unit trips or line trips, they will make larger dispatch orders to get things back in spec (typically within 15 minutes)."
329,How do scientists decide which sex is male and which is female in animals?,"The biological property of ""sex"" as it applies to an organism is that organism's reproductive role. In anisogamous species like mammals and seahorses the ""male"" is defined as the members of that species who produce large numbers of small, usually motile, gametes (known as sperm) and the ""females"" are the members of the species whose role is to provide the large, usually sessile, gametes (known as eggs or ova) in relatively fewer numbers. 
Hence the seahorse is ""male"" because its reproductive role is to provide sperm, regardless of the fact that it carries the developing embryos later."
330,"After the universe reaches maximum entropy and ""completes"" it's heat death, could quantum fluctuations cause a new big bang?","This is an area with a lot of speculative 'narratives' and not a lot of evidence-based science.

Here's an actual fact:  The origin of the universe is an unsolved physics problem.

There are plenty of believable stories about how the universe started but there are no direct observations to check them against.  We do reliably know that the universe we see now evolved from an early hot and dense state but that's about as far as the evidence goes.   The laws of physics as we understand them do not have a way of creating a big bang, so physicists are forced to come up with new theoretical ideas that might do it.  So far, there is nothing that ticks all the boxes and, even if we got that, the question of validation might remain.

One of the ideas is that the universe was started by a quantum fluctuation.  If that's correct it might happen again in the future.  The problem is that this creation out of a quantum blip speculation might be completely wrong.  It has zero evidence.

There's another problem with speculating about the distant future universe.   It's a long, long time away and the physical laws we have all have accuracy limits.  A tiny effect that might cause entropic reversal or gravitational collapse (or something) that operates at scales of say 10^(100) seconds might not even be detectable during the current lifetime of the universe, like 3 x 10^(16) seconds.

So, we don't know.  The initial universe and anything earlier is behind an evidence barrier.  Prediction of the ""end state"" universe could be wrong.  Maybe one day we will have a physics theory that covers these situations that we can all agree on, but for now, we don't.

As per usual, the evidence problem has not resulted in a shortage of ideas.

332,"i know we see the suns light 8 minutes late, but how?","So what you're basically asking is: How do we know what the speed of light is?

And the core answer is simple, but perhaps a bit unsatisfying: We measure it.

Because light is so fast, it was unclear for quite a long time whether light traveled instantaneously (with infinite speed) or whether it had some finite, but very large speed.

But in the 17th century, measurements were performed on the eclipses of Io that answered this question. Io is a moon of Jupiter which orbits close to the planet and with a short period (42.5 hours). That means that it undergoes an eclipse (where the moon is fully in the shadow of Jupiter) very frequently. At the time, it was suggested that the regular eclipses of Io could be used as some sort of clock for ships out at sea.

However, a Danish scientist, Ole Rømer, found that the period between eclipses was not constant. When the distance between Earth and Jupiter was decreasing, the time between eclipses was less than what it was when the distance between Earth and Jupiter was increasing. From this he concluded that light must take some time to travel from Jupiter to Earth and that when Jupiter was getting closer to us, the time it took for light from an eclipse to reach us would be less than the time it took for the light from the previous eclipse, making it appear that there was less time between eclipses.

Later measurements were performed in different ways but with the same conclusion. One intuitively simple way that the speed of light can be measured is by pointing a light at a distant mirror and measuring the time it takes for the reflection to return to the source.

From such measurements we know how fast light is and, more importantly, that it doesn't have infinite speed. So any light we see has taken some time to get to us. About 1 nanosecond per 30 centimeters of distance. So by knowing the distance between the Earth and the Sun (about 150 million kilometer), we can calculate that it takes light 8 minutes to reach us from the Sun."
333,What do we know about post-viral effects on the body?,"There is a long and complicated history of medical neglect and denial when it comes to post-viral illnesses. Some people develop what's called myalgic encephalmyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome after an infection or other insult (toxic mold exposure, for instance). Many viral infections have been linked to ME/CFS, including influenza. This illness can be extremely debilitating, lifelong and absolutely hellish. Most standard tests come back normal, so the medical field has long dimissed the illness as anxiety or malingering.

But evidence of immune and other dysfunction in ME/CFS is overwhelming. Several years ago, then-NIH director Francis Collins launched a deep-dive study on the illness at the NIH's Clinical Center (research hospital). The study brought in a relatively small number of patients and threw dozens of tests at them. The idea was that this 'deep phenotyping' could uncover the underlying pathology of the illness.

[https://mecfs.ctss.nih.gov/](https://mecfs.ctss.nih.gov/)

The main findingsn from the study have finally gone to a journal. So I hope they will be published soon.

Part of the reason NIH launched his study is an Institute of Medicine report from 2015 that found that ME/CFS is indeed a very real post-viral illness that is woefully under-researched. Up to 2.5 million Americans qualify for the diagnosis...and this was pre-COVID.

334,Are there any effective ways to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere?,"It's hard to capture trace quantities of stuff in the atmosphere, so direct removal of CH4 and NO is challenging. Most of the direct-air-removal type techniques target CO2, in part because there's just a lot more of it compared to the other things and it's overall a larger part of the problem. So, it goes back to technologies/tools for what IPCC and others (see e.g. [https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar3/](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar3/)) refer to as Carbon Dioxide Removal, or CDR. There are a few concepts for this:

1. Direct air capture (DAC), in which some large facility is set up that takes in atmospheric air, goes through various chemistry, extracts CO2, and then injects it into the subsurface somewhere. Note that the injection part of things overlaps with the same kind of stuff used for carbon capture and storage, in general - happy to go into (way too much) detail on that part, but beyond scope of this question. CarbFix in Iceland is looking into this as part of their overall scheme, for example. The main challenges with this approach are that it's energy intensive, so you need it linked to renewables, and it's difficult to scale up massively. It's also hard to come up with a good way to make it economically sensible. Some companies are willing to pay for it as a carbon offset, but the financial incentives aren't yet there to make it a core part of CO2 reduction yet.
2. Capture into biological systems, i.e. ""planting a bunch of trees"". In the short term, quite a few nations have this as the key part of their various ""carbon neutral by 2050"" plans, for example New Zealand. There are other biological systems that also can take a lot in. There is a plateauing effect over time for these, though - forests gradually reach a maximum growth point and then become approximately carbon neutral, so it's really a bandaid solution rather than a long-term strategy. It's also a major stressor on water resources, as forests are more water-intensive than many forms of agriculture, so you have to make sure to account for that aspect of it in a plan. Many grasslands have a high CO2 capture potential if we reverse desertification in them, but it's tricky and requires constant management.
3. Capture from the oceans, which could be a good alternative to DAC. Much of the human CO2 emissions dissolves into the ocean, so technologies that can extract a lot of it out are interesting but need further testing. The good news is that there may be a lot of offshore geologic storage potential for the captured CO2. But the technology in general still needs development, and there's the same question about economics as with DAC.
4. Biofuels with carbon capture and storage. Since photosynthetic organisms are probably the most effective way to get CO2 out of the atmosphere, systems that take in CO2 as biomass, burn that for energy, and then capture and sequester the carbon are of interest, for example the 21st Century Power Partnership.

In all cases, the largest questions tend to relate to economics. Right now, the financial incentives in the tend to be aimed towards emission reductions. It's a lot easier to come up with an approach to incentivize CO2 emitters (whether through some sort of tax on emissions, tax incentive to reduce emissions via CCS, or both) than to come up with some way of making money from direct air capture or ocean capture; those ones tend to be driven more by CO2 offsets, which aren't too helpful to get to net-negative anthropogenic CO2."
335,"Something about what we're always told about climate change doesn't make sense to me, can someone explain?","> when climate change rolls around the ocean is supposedly gonna rise a whole 10 feet or higher within the next 20 years,

Not sure where that number came from and that's a gross exaggeration of any actual projection in terms of magnitude and rate. One important aspect of sea level rise is that projections fundamentally depend on how much greenhouse gas we emit in the future. For short term (e.g., 10-20 years), it doesn't matter too much since the sea level rise that will occur over that time largely reflects warming *that has already happened*, but for further time frames, which scenario (i.e., which [representative concentration pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway) or [shared socioeconomic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Socioeconomic_Pathways)) we choose matters (and thus introduces uncertainty that is not really reducible). Let's consider this [sea level rise projection tool](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool). If we pick a sort of middle of the road prediction (SSP 2-4.5) and look at predictions for 2040 (i.e., 20 years from now) and pick the area of the Gulf Coast with the highest projected rise (which is basically southern Louisiana), we can see a projected rise of 0.45 meters (1.47 feet). Even choosing the worst case (SSP 8.5), projected rise is 0.46 meters (1.5 feet). Sticking with worst case (SSP 8.5 and southern Louisiana) and looking [out to 2150](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool?lat=28&lon=%20-91&data_layer=scenario) we see the max rise is ~2.38 meters (7.8 feet). Comparing our middle of the road (SSP2-4.5) and our worst case (SSP8.5 - click on the different scenarios at the bottom to add them to the graph) also highlights the idea that the projections increasingly diverge further into the future reflecting that sea level rise (1) lags temperature rise and (2) the amount of rise depends on the temperature, and thus emissions, in the future. The amount of sea level rise that is projected is still *extremely problematic*, but hyperbolic and demonstrably false future scenarios are not a helpful part of the conversation.

> but if any banks believed it that would mean you couldn't get a mortgage on a house anywhere in like London, Manhattan, would be covered in water constantly almost anywhere in Florida or Louisiana would be under the water right? 

This seems to reflect a lack of actually paying attention to what's happening in various places. Probably the most immediate effect has been the collapse (or the beginning of the collapse) of the insurance markets in the coastal regions of various gulf states (e.g., [this news article](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4068383-insurers-pull-back-as-us-climate-catastrophes-intensify/) or [this news article](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/11/03/with-climate-impacts-growing-insurance-companies-face-big-challenges/), or [this other one](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/06/07/insurance-coverage-loss-climate-change/)). More broadly, the discussion of the climate change related challenges the insurance industry (and people trying to buy insurance) face are also well represented in the scholarly literature (e.g., [Wagner, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01514-2)). What those all highlight is that it's getting harder to get (homeowners) insurance, in part because insurers are either going broke or leaving because the risk is too high and more expensive to get what is available (both homeowners and flood insurance) because of increased risk and/or decreased competition (i.e., if literally only one company will insure your house, you don't have much choice about what they want to charge). A large driver of this is both past expenses incurred by increasingly frequent disasters and increased risk (though it's worth noting, that it's not all climate change, there's some heaping doses of political and bureaucratic influences as well). Similar things are being seen in relation to other hazards increasing with climate change, e.g., [the recent decision for a large insurer to stop insuring new homes in California due to wildfire risk](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/05/state-farm-stopped-insuring-california-homes-due-to-climate-risks-but-it-shares-lobbyists-with-big-oil). Unless you're buying a house with cash, getting homeowners insurance is typically a prerequisite for a bank to agree to loan you the money for a house, so the effects are there if you look.

> Yet a few left leaning/ climate concerned politicians have even bought places in Florida, please explain this.

Individual's assessment of risk is, unsurprisingly, individualized. I.e., that someone who likely has large amounts of disposable income and additional homes chooses to buy/build a home in a high risk area reflects mostly that if that house is destroyed, they can either rebuild or move with (comparative) ease. Focusing on choices of individuals with the means to insulate themselves from many problems ""normal"" people cannot is a red herring and of little relevance beyond, ""rich people going to do rich people things."""
336,Why does Ganymede have no atmosphere while Titan does?,"It was a lot hotter around Jupiter when it was forming and that presumably drove off a lot of the atmospheres of its moons. Meanwhile it was a lot colder around Saturn since it's so much further away from the Sun as well as being a smaller planet. If Saturn had other large moons, they could conceivably have atmospheres as well."
337,Is there any theoretical limit to how high the Earth's temperature can become within the next 50 years due to global warming?,"Probably the place to start is with the [idealized greenhouse model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealized_greenhouse_model). This is a *very* simplified energy balance model that estimates the average temperature of a planetary atmosphere based on a few parameters, e.g., incoming solar radiation and the radiative forcing in the atmosphere - which can be related to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Now, I'll emphasize again, this is a really simple model as it's not taking into account loads of complexity (e.g., heat uptake by the ocean, atmospheric dynamics, etc.) but doing the simple back of the envelope kind of math as discussed in the wiki page gets you reasonably close to both pre-industrial average temperature and predictions for future temperatures (assuming a given concentration of CO2, more on that in a bit). The main point we can take away from this is that for a fixed concentration of CO2 (or greenhouse gases in general) and other static properties (e.g., fixed solar radiation) there is an expected equilibrium temperature for the atmosphere/surface of the planet. What this model does not include (in addition to all the complexities mentioned previously) is time, i.e., it calculates what that the equilibrium temperature should be when it reaches equilibrium, not how long it would take to get there. This is a critical aspect of anthropogenic climate change, specifically the warming we're experiencing now reflects movement toward an equilibrium temperature related mostly to *past* CO2 concentrations whereas the CO2 we are emitting now is constantly moving the target (upwards) on what that new equilibrium temperature will be in the future.

The above implies that there will be a plateau, eventually, but when it will occur and what it is, is fundamentally unknowable at the moment. This is not because we don't understand the physics or don't have the models to be able to estimate it (we do), but because it fundamentally depends on how much more CO2 and other greenhouse gases we emit in the future. This is the idea behind the standardized [representative concentration pathways or RCPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway), i.e., hypothetical scenarios for CO2 concentration in the future for us to model what happens if we follow that course. Let's consider three of these, specifically RCP2.6 (which envisions that we start reducing CO2 emissions effectively now and have completely phased them out by 2100), RCP6 (emissions peak in 2080 and decline after that), and RCP8.5 (kind of a worse case scenario, where we basically burn all fossil fuels we think exist, about as fast as we can). With this, we can see that even with the worst case scenario, the expected average temperature [by 2100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#21st_century) is ~5C above pre-industrial, which would reflect a **dramatically** different world, but not one that we would expect to be uninhabitable to humans in a physiological sense. That's not to imply that such a change on such a short timescale would not be incredibly disruptive to various aspects of civilization (e.g., agriculture), but the planet is still habitable (kind of a low bar, but it's what you asked about).

With respect to hypothetical plateaus, if we consider [climate projections, out to 2500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#/media/File:Global_mean_near-surface_air_temperature_and_thermosteric_sea-level_rise_anomalies_relative_to_the_2000%E2%80%932019_mean_for_RCP_climate_change_scenarios.webp) we can start to see the differences. For RCP2.6, we've reached the plateau effectively by 2100 and temperatures are stable (and even start to decrease a bit) in a few hundred years. For RCP6, even though emissions peak at 2080, the plateau isn't really reached until sometime between 2400-2500 and settling at something around 4-5 degrees C above pre-industrial. RCP8.5 isn't included in this set, but the plateau would likely be even further into the future and with equilibrium temperature being higher with respect to RCP6. On that graph, you can also see that some effects have even longer delays. For example, even though temperature stabilizes / starts to decrease by 2100 for RCP2.6, sea level is still rising by 2500 (reflecting both continued melting of Antarctica/Greenland and continued heat uptake by the ocean and resulting thermal expansion).

**TL;DR:** For a given, mostly static concentration of greenhouse gases, we do expect there to be an equilibrium temperature (i.e., a plateau), but there is a significant time lag to reach that equilibrium. What those equilibrium temperatures are or when they would be reached is fundamentally uncertain because it depends on how much CO2 we continue to emit, but if we pick a hypothetical scenario, we can answer the question. Even in the most extreme scenario, the vast majority of predictions do not suggest reaching a state where Earth is physiologically uninhabitable by 2100 (or later), but these do suggest a **fundamentally different** world than pre-industrial or even now, which would pose extreme challenges to a variety of aspects of civilization as we know it."
338,Quantum Chemistry: Why does the Exchange Interaction/Integral reduce the energy of the molecular orbital?,"So the exchange integral is supposed to represent the way electrons of the same spin interact, namely, they avoid each other (spatially). You can think of it as a way electrons are ""self-enforcing"" the Pauli principle from general chemistry , namely, no two electrons can have the same 4 quantum numbers. The first three quantum numbers describe the spatial distribution of the electron and the fourth one is spin. So if no two electrons can be in the same region of space with the same spin, you can interpret it as electron with the same spin should want to repel and avoid each other, thus minimizing the overall interelectronic repulsion. This is gross simplification and exchange is an entirely quantum mechanical phenomenon that has no classical analogue.

I need to double check, but I think the Szabo-Ostlund book has the plot of (pair) electron density, where it is shown that due to the exchange correlation, an electron will have diminished probability being around another electron of the same spin. Also, exchange, correlation, etc. are simply ways for us to quantify the missing physical description of the system due to the use of (rather extreme) simplification of using just a single Slater determinant as our wave function."
339,Why are Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) stronger at night?,"There are two factors to consider in MCS lifecycle: the development of new convective cores (which occurs throughout the entire lifecycle) and the detrainment/dissipation of the anvil cloud shield.

For the development of new cores, there are major differences between convection over land and ocean. Over land, convection is typically triggered by solar heating of the surface. Although the heating rate is highest at midday, it takes time for both CAPE (convective available potential energy) to increase and CIN (convective inhibition: low-level stability that prevents convection initiating) to decrease, and so typically over land you see a peak of convective activity in the afternoon/early evening (around 3-6pm local time). Over ocean, the process is driven much more by longwave cooling of the upper atmosphere. This is highest during the nighttime, but convective activity is generally more spread out across the diurnal cycle.

 Local effects are also important. As you move further towards the poles over land, solar heating becomes weaker and so convection tends to occur later during the day. You can also get a larger contribution from longwave cooling, which leads to some interesting situation such as over the Northern Great Plains of North America where there is a double peak of convective activity, once in the early evening and then again around midnight.

How convection triggers is also very important in this regard. For isolated convection, triggering mainly occurs due to heating of the surface. For organised convection, including MCSs, we also see triggering of new convective cores due to the cold outflow lifting warm air above the level of free convection. As MCS involve the convergence of warm, moist air over vast areas, this can lead to more triggering of new convection later in the day and into the night using CAPE produced during the day time, whereas the lack of solar heating would prevent convective initiation for isolated cases.

So for convective cores (over land), despite the heating occurring during the daytime, we expect the convective activity to trigger in the afternoon and early evening and continue into the night-time, particularly for cases of organised convection. We also need to consider the other component of the MCS: the anvil cloud or ""cloud-shield"" and how it is affected by the diurnal cycle.

The cloud-shield of an MCS is formed when the anvil clouds of multiple cores combine into one, and it is generally this that we see from satellite imagery, not the cores themselves. The lifecycle of the cloud shield is also linked to the diurnal cycle.

The size and lifetime of an anvil cloud is determined both by the amount of convective mass flux into it (i.e. the core convective activity) and the detrainment and dissipation of the anvil cloud at the edge. The latter is strongly driven by circulations within the cloud, which in turn is driven by the difference in radiative heating between the cloud top and cloud base.

At the cloud base, the cloud is heated by radiation absorbed from the atmosphere below, and at the cloud top it is heated by absorbed solar radiation and cooled by longwave emission. Despite the solar heating during the daytime, this difference in heating is actually stronger due to the greater heating from below compared to at night (see e.g. figure 7 in [https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JD033107](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JD033107) ). As a result, anvils tend to dissipate more rapidly during the daytime than during the nighttime. It should be noted that the cloud shields of MCSs tend to be thicker than the anvils of isolated convection, so this radiatively driven dissipation is particularly important. 

Combining these two together we can get a picture of the overall MCS lifecycle (over land): Initial convective activity occurs in the later afternoon due to solar heating building up CAPE and removing CIN during the daytime. The outflow from this convection triggers more convective cores throughout the evening and into the nighttime, and the anvils of these cores combine to create a large, thick cloud shield which matures during the nighttime. As new convective activity reduces through the night and into the early morning the MCS cloud shield starts to dissipate, but only slowly at first. As we move into the daytime, the rate of dissipation speeds up and the cloud shield reduces in size until new convective activity in the afternoon reinvigorates it and starts the process again.

Over time, the MCS anvil tends to become warmer and lower in height as the upper troposphere is warmed and stabilised. This reduces convective activity and increases anvil dissipation until eventually the MCS dissipates.

Note that this is a fairly simple view of things, primarily over land (where the diurnal cycle of convection is much stronger), and ignores interactions with synoptic scale dynamics such as Rossby waves and African Easterly waves which are both strong drivers of MCSs.

Understanding the lifecycle of complex, organised convective systems including MCSs is a fairly important area of research right now. Past studies of MCS behaviour were limited due to the observations/models which could capture the entire MCS (such as geostationary satellite imagery and global climate models) could not be used to study the convective cores, and studies of convective cores (using e.g. cloud radar and LES models) typically could not resolved the entire extent and lifecycle of MCSs. New data, such as the modern generation of geostationary weather satellites, new satellite missions such as Earthcare, INCUS and AOS and the global, kilometer scale convective resolving climate models look set to allow much more insight into thee processes, so there's a lot of exciting research going on right now. It has even been suggested (perhaps optimistically) that this is the decade of convection!

If you'd like to learn more about MCS behaviour, there are a number of recent papers on observing MCS lifecycles by Zhe Feng, Rémy Roca, Thomas Fiolleau and Kelly Núñez Ocasio.

Dennis Hartmann's group has also been producing a lot of interesting research on anvil cloud lifetimes. I would recommend checking out his recent papers with Adam Sokol and Blaž Gasparini.

For a more general overview of cloud behaviour, I recommend Cloud Dynamics by Robert Houze Jr, it's an excellent textbook on everything to do with clouds, and has a couple of sections on deep convection and MCSs. Storm and Cloud dynamics, by William Cotton, George Bryan and Sue van den Heever is also an excellent reference text.

Let me know if there's anything you'd like me to expand upon, this is the area I'm currently researching and there's a lot of interesting new work going on!"
340,"If radioactive elements decay over time, how is there any left after the 4.5 billion years?","Few different reasons:

1. Some have very long half-lives. E.g., [thorium-232](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-232) has a half life of 14 billion years, so over 4.5 billion years, if you do the math, there's only been around a ~~9%~~ 19% (now with bonus correct math) reduction in the starting amount incorporated at the time of Earth's formation.

2. For some that have shorter half lives (but still relatively long), these were incorporated at high enough concentrations into the Earth at the time of formation that we still have measurable amounts left. A decent example of this is [uranium-235](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235), which has a half life of 703.8 million years. If you again do the math, that works out to ~~85%~~ ~98% reduction in the amount of U-235 compared to the formation of Earth (and we can see that reflected in things like the estimates of contribution of specific isotopes to the [internal heat budget of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget#/media/File:Evolution_of_Earth's_radiogenic_heat-with_total.svg)), but there's still enough that it represents around 0.7% of all Uranium (most by far is the much longer lived Uranium-238).

3. There are variety of ways shorter-lived isotopes can be produced and thus they still exist as their supply is constantly ""replenished"". Some are produced during [decay chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain) of other longer-lived radioactive isotopes. For example, in the decay chain of [U-238](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain#Uranium_series), U-234 (half life of ~245,000 years) and Th-230 (half life of ~75,000 years) are produced during the decay from U-238 to Pb-206. Others are generated by interaction with cosmic rays, forming  [cosmogenic isotopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogenic_nuclide). Some longer lived examples of these are Be-10 (1.38 million year half life), Al-26 (717,000 year half life), Cl-36 (301,000 year half life), and C-14 (5,730 year half life), among others."

343,How are solvents able to dissolve polymers?,"If you imagine a plate of spaghetti, and then you add a lot of water to that and gently stir, the spaghetti strands will begin to disentangle and seperate from one another. 

This is effectively what happens when you add a polymer to solvent. No covalent bonds are broken (each spaghetti
 strand remains intact), it's just the intermolecular forces (the entanglements etc) which are broken.

In some polymers, such as thermoset plastics, the individual chains are also covalently linked together. In these cases you cannot dissolve the polymer for precisely this reason. Depending on how much they're crosslinked, you may be able to swell them with solvent, but not dissolve"
344,"If the Americas were submerged, would earthquakes in Japan and the Philippines cause tsunamis to hit Western Europe?","In this hypothetical, a lot would depend on how ""submerged"" we're talking in terms of the Americas. Water depth is an important control in tsunami propagation and dispersion, e.g., modeling by [Ha & Cho, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029801815000815) highlight that a tsunami wave encountering a shallow spot can lead to a fair amount of dispersion of the wave. Thus, the answer would be pretty different if we envision a scenario with a shallow inland sea that covers all of the Americas (e.g., something like a larger [Western Interior Seaway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Interior_Seaway)) vs. a scenario where the North American continent just isn't there and it's just effectively abyssal plain between the Pacific and Atlantic (i.e., deep water). 

With that caveat above, even in the case most suitable for propagation (i.e., deep water throughout), tsunami waves still dissipate with distance. Let's consider an example to illustrate this. The [2011 Tohoku earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami) is a decent test case as it generated a large tsunami. If we look at the effects of this on the other side of the Pacific, e.g., [in California](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/11f09444663f4d99a83083be560a1c11), we can see that they were certainly not zero, but effects were mostly restricted to strong currents in complexities along the coastline (bays, harbors, inlets, etc.). Now, if we imagine a hypothetical where that same tsunami instead traversed the Pacific, our ""deep water North America"", and the Atlantic, we've added *a lot* of distance for additional dissipation. You'd have to do the modelling (the math associated with tsunami propagation is not exactly simple, see Ha & Cho again) to get at concrete numbers, but the expectation would be that a tsunami originating in Japan or the Philippines might technically reach western Europe, but by the time it did, it would probably be so diminished that it would probably be barely noticeable (and maybe not even measurable). Obviously, the size of the tsunami scales with the size of the source (and details of the source), so if you had some sort of massive source (e.g., asteroid impact) then the answer might be different, but within the scale of tsunamis from earthquakes, I think the answer would effectively be, ""eh, maybe, but it's going to be really small if you can even tell it happened."""
345,How do we calculate orbital maneuvers with constant (low) thrust along the way ?,"Most cases you don't have closed form solutions appart from maybe limited theoretical cases like a 2 body problem with point masses.

346,Would the world run out of carbon and life cease to exist?,"No. Even if we assume that carbon bound up in fossil fuels was somehow lost forever, there are still *massive* reservoirs of carbon that are still actively cycled in the [deep carbon cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_carbon_cycle), e.g., carbonate rocks at both the surface in the mantle. In detail, without active extraction, the fossil fuels would also be added to this cycle through a variety of processes, e.g., seeps as the reservoirs near the surface through uplift and erosion and/or subduction for those hosted on lithosphere that is able to be subducted."
347,Will there ever be a machine that transfers smells in a way like phones transfer voices? Exaple: my friend calls/pings me to share how their new parfume smells,"Unlikely.

To see why, lets consider how sound works (note: most of this also applies to images/video). Sound is transferred through air through vibrations. A vibrating membrane in a speaker pushes the air and the pattern of these movements is registered by our ears.

As long as we have something to drive the vibration of this membrane (that is: As long as we can power a speaker), we can keep producing sound. It doesn't ""run out"".

In addition, even the most complex symphony is a composition of simple sound waves. With a complex sound, the speaker has to vibrate in a more complicated pattern, but it's still just a membrane being moved back and forth in some way.

Now lets look (or sniff?) at smells. We smell things because certain molecules enter our nose and trigger a response there. Different molecules trigger a different response. But unlike sound (or images), there is no basic element that can be used to create all (or even most) possible scents. To properly reproduce some perfume, your smell-device will have to contain the substances used in the perfume. It'll need the components of a fart, the substances that give all kinds of foods their smells, parts of various flowers and the list goes on. Some of these substances might not have a long shelf life when isolated from where they normally are. And no matter how extensive you make the array of substances stored in your scent-speaker, there'll always be some new or unusual smell that it does not have available.

And while sound, being just the movement of air, doesn't expend anything, sending some substances into the air to reproduce a scent uses up this substance. That means that a scent-speaker will need to be refilled regularly.

So you're looking at needing a large number of substances to reproduce the scents, some of which may not last for long and all of which will need to be replaced when they run out. This makes managing ink cartridges seem downright fun by comparison.

And finally, when you turn off a sound producing device or a display, the sound or the image are gone. When your scent-speaker has filled the air with some abyssal mixture of unpleasantness, it's going to linger even after you turn the device off.

There have been some scent-producing devices made as prototypes or gimmicks ([example](https://hapticsol.com/cilia/cilia-acvr) with only 6 different scents), the concept is too impractical for mass use."
348,How are clouds created?,"Air can only hold so much evaporated water. If air is warmer, or under more pressure, it can hold more, if air is cooler or under less pressure, it can hold less. When air contains the maximum amount of evaporated water, we say that it is *saturated*.

So if saturated air becomes any colder, or loses a little pressure, now there is more water evaporated into the air than the air is capable of holding. At this point, some of the water vapor (a gas) will revert to a liquid state, as small droplets of water. This *can* happen by itself, but it’s much, much faster if the air contains small impurities. A speck of dust, a wayward bacterium carried on the wind, a scrap of airborne sea salt carried up from a crashing ocean wave…any of these can act as a *nucleation site*…a surface on which water gas can condense to liquid water (or, if it’s cold enough, an ice crystal).

So wherever a patch of saturated air encounters the right conditions, [lots and lots of little bits of water condense around lots and lots of nucleation sites into lots and lots of very tiny droplets](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/), which is what we call a cloud. As long as these droplets stay small enough, they can stay suspended in the air for quite a while…but eventually, either the temperature/pressure increases and the water evaporates again, or the drops grow too large and begin to fall under the influence of gravity, and you get snow/rain."
349,What if any effect does Monday-Friday heavy driving have on the weather?,"So I'll start with the caveat that I'm not an atmospheric scientist or meteorologist, and someone with that domain expertise can probably provide a lot more detail. At a shallow level though, there is some evidence for weekly variations in precipitation that might be tied to pollution, but within the context of your question, it's not CO2 emissions driving this, but aerosols. In short, aerosol emissions that can serve as [cloud condensation nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei) have the ability to influence cloud formation and thus precipitation patterns in a couple of different ways (e.g., [Rosenfeld et al., 2008](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1160606)). Specific to your question, and looking at data from the US, [Bell et al., 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007JD008623) found a few different weekly variations in precipitation that attributed mostly to vehicle aerosol emissions and their various effects. In detail though, they found offset patterns in different regions, i.e., they found a mid-week precipitation peak in the southeastern US and a weekend peak in the Atlantic coastal regions. As they layout in their discussion, there also appears to be changes in these pattern through time, which they relate to different types of pollution (and thus different types of aerosols) that have different impacts in terms of cloud formation and precipitation."
350,What were conditions like during the Deccan Traps eruptions?,"Broadly, the ~300 kyr before the K-Pg extinction correspond to the Late Maastrichtian Warming Event, which is usually attributed to CO2 degassed from the Deccan Traps (e.g., [Barnet et al., 2018](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/46/2/147/525172/A-new-high-resolution-chronology-for-the-late), [Hull et al., 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aay5055), [Nava et al., 2021](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2007797118)). This event reflects a period of short term increase of average temperatures by 2-5^(o) C. The outgassing of CO2 and subsequent uptake of it by the ocean may have also lead to significant ocean acidification (e.g., [Dameron et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018217307009), [Keller et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818120302034)), but distinguishing acidification attributable to the Deccan traps broadly is a bit tricky given expected acidification from the Chicxulub impact (e.g., [Henehan et al., 2019](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1905989116)). While the Late Maastrichtian Warming Event is relatively well tied to the pre K-Pg Deccan Traps both temporally and mechanistically, as discussed in several of the linked papers, it seems like it requires more CO2 to outgas than we'd expect based on eruptive volumes from that time. Finally, relating climate changes to large igneous provinces (like the Deccan Traps) comes with challenges because these eruptions have two main climate modifying components, CO2 which drives warming and SO2 which drives cooling, and while there are often ways to reconstruct the amount of CO2 outgassed, it's much harder to constrain the amount of SO2 (e.g., [Tobin et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216301778)). The Tobin paper is also quite relevant for the ""extreme events"" aspect of the question. I.e., in their modeling of climatic responses, individual pulses don't have too much of an effect, it's more the building of CO2 concentrations in aggregate that has the main climatic impact."
351,Could Ice Age happen if fossil fuels get globally banned?,"Wow, this is almost all complete nonsense.

> The last ice age, which is also known as the Pleistocene Ice Age, began about 2.5 million years ago and ended about 11,700 years ago. 

So, the bot has confused the beginning and ending of the [Pleistocene epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene) with the extent of the [Quaternary glaciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_glaciation), likely because the latter is sometime called the Pleistocene glaciation. More importantly, we're still in the Quaternary ice age. As discussed many places (e.g., [this from our FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/climate_change_ice_age/)), an ""ice age"" means there is persistent ice at the poles but within an ice age, there will be glacial (ice extent at a temporary max) and interglacial (ice extent at a temporary min) periods. We are in an interglacial period of the current (Quaternary) ice age.

>During this time, the Earth's climate was much colder than it is today, and large ice sheets covered much of North America, Europe, and Asia.

This is true for the [Last Glacial Maximum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum) and other glacial periods within the Quarternary glaciation, but not for the entire Pleistocene. For example [this reconstruction of temperature (relative to a baseline) for the last 5 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_temperature_record#/media/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.png) highlights that on average the Pleistocene was colder than the epochs that preceded it, but that there was a lot of variation between colder (glacials) and warmer (interglacials) periods.

> It is possible that the Earth could enter another ice age in the future. 

Given that we're currently in an ice age, the statement is effectively meaningless, but if we assume the bot learned that ""ice age"" = ""glacial period"" (which it 100% does not), then we're talking about a certainty, not a possibility, i.e., there will be another glacial period in the future. 

> However, this is not likely to happen anytime soon. The current climate is being warmed by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels. This warming is offsetting the natural factors that would otherwise lead to an ice age.

So this is about as close as the bot gets to not completely making things up. To borrow some text from the previously linked FAQ (which is fine, since I wrote it), ""The general consensus is that even without anthropogenic warming, that Earth would have been in an abnormally long interglacial, but anthropogenic forcing has dramatically extended that interglacial. In terms of when the next glacial period may start, obviously it depends a lot on future emissions and a variety of other assumptions, but the projections suggest that anthropogenic forcing will extend the current interglacial by anywhere from 25,000-50,000 years beyond what its duration would have been naturally, pushing the total time until the start of the next glacial cycle out to 50,000-100,000 years in the future (e.g., [Loutre & Berger, 2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1005559827189), [Herrero et al., 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-1012-0), [Ganopolski et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16494)).""

> In a desperate attempt to cool the planet, world leaders have agreed to a global ban on fossil fuels. The ban has a dramatic effect. Within a few years, the Earth's climate begins to cool. Ice sheets start to grow, and the average global temperature drops. By 2070, the Earth is in the midst of a new ice age.

LOL wut? Ok. So again, still in an ice age. As evidenced by the discussion above, we were not in a permanent glacial period before the beginning of anthropogenic emissions and we'd likely be in for a long interglacial in the absence of those emissions, so it's not as though a ban on fossil fuels would plunge us into a glacial period. If the bot had come up with a ban on emissions, coupled with active CO2 removal from the atmosphere and sequestration at incredibly aggressive scale along with some similarly aggressive and poorly planned out [solar geoengineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_geoengineering) project, than we could start to think about some cooling, but it would still be a pretty big leap to think about causing a glacial period in 30 years. 

Let's take a look at some of the [Representative Concentration Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway). These are basically agreed upon hypothetical future scenarios of CO2 emissions to have some standardized inputs for climate models in terms of these emissions. RCP2.6 specifically includes a complete cessation of CO2 emissions by 2100, so further out than the bot's random ""2042"" choice, but will stand in fine, i.e., if the bot wasn't full of crap, we'd expect by 2130 to be rapidly descending into a glacial period. If we look at results of climate models [extending out to 2500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#/media/File:Global_mean_near-surface_air_temperature_and_thermosteric_sea-level_rise_anomalies_relative_to_the_2000%E2%80%932019_mean_for_RCP_climate_change_scenarios.webp) and which include RCP2.6 (the dark blue line), we'll see that effectively average temperatures would be expected to hover around 0.75^(o) C warmer than the last 20 years for the 400 years that follow. I.e., definitely not a glacial period and definitely not fast.

The rest is basically word salad and random platitudes, so I'm not going to pick that apart. 

**TL;DR:** Suffice to say, the underlying premises for all of this are (1) at best really mistaken and at worst completely and totally wrong and (2) seems to mostly be a rip off of the ""Day After Tomorrow"" somehow with an *even less believable* premise than in that movie. This highlights that at present, large language models are not a replacement for actual scientists or, apparently, screenwriters.

352,Can relatives fill a niche?,"There's been an interesting debate about this in New Zealand about red deer (an introduced pest) filling the ecological niche of the moa (large, extinct herbivorous bird).

Some have tried to argue that native bush cannot regenerate to its prehuman state without a keystone browsing herbivores so deer should be left undisturbed on conservation land rather than being exterminated. 

Others have argued (in my opinion more convincingly) that deer don't browse in the same way as Moa did and contribute to the spread of fungal diseases among threatened plant species.

Obviously that's kind of an extreme example because the moa have no close modern analogues (closest match is probably ostriches or emus but they have a very different preferred climate and diet)"
353,How is lemon juice so much more acidic compared to citric and malic acid?,"You can't really say ""what is the pH of citric acid"". Citric acid is the acidic component, and the pH of the solution depends on the concentration. If you put in more citric acid, the pH of the solution drops.

Citric acid in higher concentrations can certainly get to pH 2, possibly even lower. Unless you increase the pH of the solution, for instance by adding citrate or another base."
354,Are there any animals that don't store their brain in their head?,"If you have complex eyes (compound eyes, focusing lenses, retina, ability to track objects, etc) you need a short connection to the brain in order to be able to process the images from those eyes. The optic nerve of a mammal and other animals with good vision is a very short and direct connection to the brain - in some ways, the optic nerve is a cranial nerve unlike every other sensory nerve you have. In computing terms, you need a low latency and high bandwidth connection between the imaging sensor and the image processing computer.

Eyes have to be somewhere that they are useful, but they are also delicate. For most animals that means on top, in some sort of protective turret with a good view - a head. That puts the brain in the head, near the eyes, and conveniently behind that armour too.

Sure, your brain would be better protected if it was in your abdomen behind a bunch of hard bone, but then your eyes would be near your navel and that wouldn't work so well for tracking hunting targets or seeing oncoming threats.

All of this tends to select for a head, on a swivelling neck, with brain and eyes up there. As a bonus, you can also attach ears there. While ears don't require the massive nerve connections of eyes, they still benefit from being near the brain."

The air pressure at its summit is about 330 hPa.  However, as the weather changes, other very tall mountains (like K2) may briefly have the lowest pressure.  Anyway it's almost certainly some mountain in the Himalaya or Karakorum mountain ranges.

362,Is there anything regulating the size of tectonic plates and is the number of plates fixed?,"Let's start with the (relatively) easier question first. Specifically:

> Has there been more plates throughout earths’ history?

If you mean has there been a time with more individual plates than now? Maybe, but at least for the last 500 million years, most reconstructions suggest we have either more plates now than in the past or near equal number of plates to past local maxima, but this very quickly gets into questions about how we define plates (which is more complicated than you might think, we'll come back to that). For example, if we consider the review paper by [Seton et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-022-00384-8) (which, by the way, is a great resource for understanding how we reconstruct plates in the past), they track the number of plates within two different long-term models of plate motion and dynamics, specifically [Merdith et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825220305237) - which goes all the way back to 1 billion years ago, but the Seton review considers just the last 500 Ma (million years) and [Seton et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825212000311) - which goes back to 200 Ma. What this comparison shows (Figure 6, if you have access) is that the number of plates have definitely changed overtime (depending on which reference, ranging from 10 to just shy of 50) but the two reconstructions differ pretty substantially during the period of overlap. This last point highlights that there is a good amount of uncertainty with respect to past numbers of plates so interpreting whether the current number of plates is an absolute max or close to a local max (or neither) is hard.

To try to keep what will already be a long answer a little manageable, I'll refer you to existing FAQs we have discussing some processes that break up plates, e.g., [how 'minor' plates form](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/minor_plates/) and [how plates break](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/rift_formation/). The processes described there would generally increase the number of plates. The corresponding process that decreases the number of plates is mainly [suturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suture_%28geology%29), but there are a few other mechanisms that can reduce the number of plates. Now, let's move onto the questions about controls on number of plates and their sizes. For these, it's easier to consider both at the same time since the concepts involved kind of span both:

> What regulates the size and shape of tectonic plates?

>Is there something that prevents there from being hundreds of smaller plates or simply two large plates?


To start with this, it's worth acknowledging that the number of plates *right now* itself is a bit of a moving target. To be clear, this is not because any of the processes discussed previously that can change the number of plates are doing so on short timescales, but instead because how we define plates (and the measurements we can make to do so) evolve. [Harrison, 2016](https://earth-planets-space.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40623-016-0400-x) provides an interesting summary of different estimates of plates since the dawn of plate tectonics, with many of these early estimates suggesting ~15 plates (e.g., [Morgan, 1971](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/books/book/137/chapter-abstract/3789504/Plate-Motions-and-Deep-Mantle-Convection?redirectedFrom=fulltext)), [Bird, 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2001GC000252) defined 52 plates, whereas Harrison defines 159 plates. The jump from 15 to 52 mostly reflects better understanding of plate tectonic mechanisms and better measurements. The jump from 52 to 159 starts instead to get into more fundamental questions, basically asking if a plate deforms internally, is it still a single (deforming) plate or several smaller plates (e.g., [Thatcher, 1995](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB03064), [Thatcher, 2007](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005JB004244)). In a simple perspective, the estimate of 52 plates allow for some internal deformation of plates whereas the 159 plates applies a very strict ""to be a plate, it must be internally rigid"" definition. What this also means is that the answers to your questions about the number and sizes of plates will depend a bit on how you define plates.

Now, with the above as a caveat, one place to start is relationships we see between sizes and numbers of plates. A lot of these analyses have been done, Anderson being one, but other examples include [Sornette & Pisarenko, 2003](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2002GL015043) and [Morra et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13002021). The details of these differ a bit, but they all effectively show a negative sloped power law relationship between plate area and number of plates (i.e., there are fewer big plates than smaller plates) with a notable kink (i.e., the slope of the line changes). Interestingly, even though Sornette & Pisarenko and Morra's paper tend to use a less strict definition of a plate than Anderson (i.e., the former have ~50 plates in the modern, and Anderson has his 159), both show similar forms of relationship, i.e., a negative power law relationship with a kink. Morra's paper is especially useful as they pair their area-number relationship with plate tectonic reconstructions and show that while there are changes in this relationship, the overall form (e.g., the location of the kink) stays pretty constant. The existence of these types of relationships that seem to be maintained through geologic time are typically used to argue that the number and size of plates are an emergent property of the system that reflects self-organization. 

So what's driving this self-organization? Most of the papers suggest it's tied to global geodynamics and the links between plate motion and mantle convection (e.g., [Anderson, 2002a](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/34871/1/Anderson_p411.pdf), [Anderson, 2002b](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/30/5/411/192380/How-many-plates), Morra et al., 2016). Again here, I'll punt to an existing FAQ [on the drivers of plate tectonic motion and specifically its connection to mantle convection](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/).

**TL;DR:** The number of plates is not constant through time, but we also must recognize that defining exactly how many plates we have now (or in the past) is actually hard because it requires semi-arbitrary choices of how much internal deformation do we allow before we say 1 plate is no longer 1 plate, but instead several plates. What does seem clear is that through geologic time, there appears to be a fundamental power law relationship between sizes and number of plates that leads to a lot of small plates and few large plates at any given time. This statistical property of plates is usually considered a sign of ""self-organization"" and is turn an emergent property of the interaction between plates and mantle dynamics. This is also discussed in terms of something like a ""minimum energy state"", i.e., it's not a random property, but one that develops through all of the complicated interactions driving plate motion and shape change."
363,"Do we know which specific organisms are in oil, and if so how?","Biomarkers in petroleum allow us to get a decent idea of what organisms contributed to a given deposit.

Many of these precursor organic molecules are diagnostic of the type of organism that originally produced it.

364,How do submarines maintain a particular depth in the sea?,"This is trickier than you might realize!  Buoyancy underwater can be an *unstable* system.

Suppose I have a ballast tank filled with water and air at the same pressure as the outside ocean.  If the tank happens to sink a little, the pressure rises and the air compresses.  This makes the tank less buoyant so it sinks even faster!  If the tank rises up a little, the air expands, and buoyancy pushes the tank upwards.

Thus, a container with air in pressure communication with the surrounding water needs active control to maintain stability.

Fish have this problem, and so do diving bells and scuba divers.  Divers use a “buoyancy compensation device”, a flexible bag of air.  They must actively control the air inside it as they dive.  If you swim down, you start to sink faster.  It’s alarming and potentially dangerous!

On the other hand, if your tank is *sealed* from surrounding water pressure, the air doesn’t compress and buoyancy doesn’t change.  This is neutrally stable: going down doesn’t cause you to sink more, but it doesn’t push you back up either.

But if your ballast tank is at a different pressure than the water outside, it needs to be very strong or it’ll be crushed.

Submarines use large main ballast tanks connected to the ocean to float at the surface.  They fill these with water *completely* when they want to dive.  They have smaller tanks that (I think) are sealed away from the ocean to adjust their buoyancy underwater.

Two final factors affecting stability: the ocean’s density increases with depth because it’s colder below.  Thus a submarine with constant density will be stable: if it sinks into denser water it will float back up.

And finally, the sub’s density is *not* quite constant because the water pressure compresses the hull a tiny little bit.  (Or a whole lot, if you’re a bad submarine designer.)"
365,Do satellites rotate to stay oriented toward earth?,"Yes, to remain oriented to keep a desired side of the satellite pointed towards the surface (the side with cameras or antennas or whatever), it needs to spin once per orbit. The ISS also does this to ensure that its large solar panels are always held perpendicular to the direction of travel, which helps reduce the drag from the thin atmosphere at its orbit."
366,Do all planets in our solar system have their magnetic North/South poles the same way up as Earth?,"No, for a bunch of reasons.

1) Not all planets (and moons) have global magnetic fields at all.  Mars, for instance, only has weird patterns of [local magnetic fields](https://sci.esa.int/web/mars-express/-/58555-crustal-fields-on-mars) caused by magnetized parts of the rocks in the upper crust.  Walk a few dozen miles on Mars, and your compass might point in a totally different direction.  Other planets, like Venus, appear to have no measurable internal field at all -- at least nothing we've been able to measure from orbit.

2) Even the planets that do have strong internal magnetic fields aren't aligned with Earth.  For example, [Jupiter's magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Jupiter) points roughly the opposite direction from Earth's.  For right now, anyway, because:

3) Not all planets have internally-generated fields that are stable over a long time.  [Earth's field](https://climate.nasa.gov/explore/ask-nasa-climate/3104/flip-flop-why-variations-in-earths-magnetic-field-arent-causing-todays-climate-change), for instance, reverses direction every few tens of thousands to millions of years.  Other planets with strong internal fields might do this too, and if they do they won't keep the same schedule.

4) Not all planets have fields that are stable over even a *short* time.  [Europa](https://europa.nasa.gov/resources/174/induced-magnetic-field-from-europas-subsurface-ocean/), for instance, has a field that's not generated internally, but is created by magnetic induction created by changes in *Jupiter's* field.  So the field changes in sync with Jupiter's rotation rate.  Venus has a field that's created by the collision between the solar wind and the planet's atmosphere, and so it depends on the Sun's solar activity."
367,Does our universe rotate?,"Easy answer: We don't know.

Longer-ish answer: The problem with trying to observe the universe is our extremely limited perspective. The majority of our observations are from a relatively fixed point in space (earth) and even sending probes and satellites out of Earth's orbit isn't really a good enough distance to really figure it out. The universe is extremely, impossibly large. We would need to make observations from a completely different galaxy and getting that far already is going to be tough. Even better would be making observations from multiple large distances away from Earth. We got our work cut out for use, lol"
368,Why are there significantly more species now than there were before the Chicxulub Impact?,"I assume for this you're discussing the ""Sepkoski Curve"" or something similar, e.g., [the chart that appears on this page](http://strata.geology.wisc.edu/jack/) from [Sepkoski et al., 1981](https://www.nature.com/articles/293435a0) and many subsequent updates that is an estimate of diversity of (marine) organisms through the Phanerozoic (i.e., from the Cambrian to now). As you hint at, there are a lot of challenges in producing estimates like those for the Sepkoski curve and similar and thus there's a lot of reasons to think part of what we may be seeing reflects biases as opposed to a real signal. 

One immediate challenge is something we (geologists) often refer to as the ""Sadler Effect"" (e.g., [Sadler, 1981](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/628623)). Put simply, this is the idea that (1) the stratigraphic record is more incomplete the further back you go and (2) considering quantities we calculate from these rocks (or things preserved in them like fossils) can be biased depending on the length of the interval considered. The Sadler Effect is usually discussed for things like sedimentation rates and the like, but it has relevance potential biases in the fossil record (though it's not often discussed explicitly as the Sadler Effect in paleo literature as far as I can tell).

In addition to the Sadler Effect, there are *a lot* of other biases that can influence these types of data. [Smith, 2007](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jgs/article/164/4/731/372478/Marine-diversity-through-the-Phanerozoic-problems) provides a nice summary and highlights a few specific issues: geographical biases, sampling efficiency, stratigraphic completeness (basically a form of the Sadler Effect from above), fossil preservation, and details of the way the taxonomy on the fossils are done. 

For geographic bias, a lot of our fossil record has traditionally come from North America or Western Europe and there remain questions about how much that has biased ""global"" curves, i.e., even if we ignore the other biases, if our curves mainly reflect what was happening in two somewhat small areas, is that representative of global patterns? Early work seemed to suggest that the geographic bias was not that significant (e.g., [Smith & McGowan, 2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00693.x)), but later efforts suggest that this might actually be a relatively large source of bias (e.g., [McGowan & Smith, 2016](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/abs/are-global-phanerozoic-marine-diversity-curves-truly-global-a-study-of-the-relationship-between-regional-rock-records-and-global-phanerozoic-marine-diversity/F05F2A508343B3C2C30C2A5062A4B348)).

Sampling efficiency basically is suggesting that certain intervals might be better sampled than others and that this could bias the results (e.g., [Miller & Foote, 1996](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/paleobiology/article/abs/calibrating-the-ordovician-radiation-of-marine-life-implications-for-phanerozoic-diversity-trends/F36C50F628E61ABACD9530F13C68A4FC)). This has some overlap with the geographic bias above and the stratigraphic completeness (i.e., Sadler effect type concerns) in that the reason a particular interval might be better sampled is that it's more accessible and/or there's more exposure of it since it's younger, etc.

Preservation potential also plays in here, i.e., even if a lot of rocks of the right age are preserved widely, how likely is a particular organism to be preserved in the fossil record to be counted? There are pretty obvious and well known biases (e.g., animals with hard parts are more likely to be preserved than animals with only soft parts, think a snail vs a slug), but even for those with hard parts, fossilization is still relatively rare with a lot of factors that control the likelihood and as such, we could be missing significant numbers of species/genera (e.g., [Cooper et al., 2006](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/34/4/241/129498/Completeness-of-the-fossil-record-Estimating)). On top of that, for some groups, there appears to be a change through time where generally skeletons/components have gotten harder and more likely to be preserved (e.g., [Bush & Bambach, 2004](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/424576), [Smith, 2003](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/paleobiol/article/33/2/310/140462/Intrinsic-versus-extrinsic-biases-in-the-fossil)), which could definitely contribute to an apparent increase in diversity, even if diversity was not increasing.

Finally, another large source of bias is just the way we classify fossils, i.e., taxonomy, along with things like first and last occurrence. There's a lot bound up in here, but basically, there's a lot of noise in these data and the patterns you can reliably extract from them depend a lot on both how you filter that noise, but also the underlying source of the noise (e.g., [Patterson & Smith, 1989](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1941349)).

To try to deal with many of the issues above, there has been a lot of work to try to come up with better sampling practices and/or ways to deal with the taxonomic noise (e.g., [Alroy et al., 2001](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.111144698), [Bush et al., 2004](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/paleobiol/article/30/4/666/140392/Removing-bias-from-diversity-curves-the-effects-of), [Alroy et al, 2008](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1156963), and others). While results of these are mixed (e.g., Bush rejects much of the earlier Alroy result), depending on how you sample and attempt to correct these data, a lot of that huge spike in diversity in the Cenozoic compared to the Mesozoic or Paleozoic is removed (for example, Figure 1 of the Alroy et al., 2008 paper).

**TL;DR** We need to be approach estimates of diversity in the paleobiology record with some caution. There are a lot of different things that can bias these records and depending on how we filter / collect the underlying data, the patterns can end up looking very different. Final caveat is that I'm a geologist, not a paleontologist/paleobiologist, so I'm sure someone in that subdiscipline can provide more information and/or potential corrections to the above."

I'm not personally that familiar with South Dakota geology (maybe someone else will chime in), but the first place to start is with a geologic map. This [very basic one](http://www.sdgs.usd.edu/geologyofsd/geosd.html) from the SD state department of natural resources gives you a first order idea. Basically, there are *potential* (doesn't mean they're actually exposed or good) exposures of the K-T (or K-Pg as it's also known these days) anywhere the lighter green blobs (upper Cretaceous) contact the darker orange blobs (Tertriary), so that narrows the areas by a lot (e.g., basically anywhere in eastern South Dakota is out). While you're on the go, there are a lot of good phone apps that allow you to look at the geology of where you are, the two that I know of for the US are [Flyover Country](https://flyovercountry.io/) and [Rock'd](https://rockd.org/). Rock'd tends to have a lot more information and is more designed for being on the ground (as opposed to Flyover Country, where the idea is that you can figure out what you're looking at from a plane), so I'd recommend that one for this purpose. Finally, probably the most specific resources will be the [Roadside Geology](https://www.amazon.com/Roadside-Geology-South-Dakota-Gries/dp/0878423389) book for South Dakota. This is a great series that exists for most (but not all) US states that provides descriptions and directions to interesting outcrops available by car."
372,"When the earth loses atmosphere to space, where does it go?","As far as I understand it, much of it is carried off by solar wind.  The sun is constantly shooting out a ""wind"" of charged particles in every direction, and light itself also does exert a non-zero force onto anything it hits.  Planetary atmospheres can be completely blown away by this wind.

Mars is probably a good example of this - the jagged, grooved landscape of Mars is evidence of a much denser atmosphere having existed eons ago.  There is considerable evidence of erosion by flowing gas and/or liquid - such erosion simply cannot happen without an atmosphere.

The advantage Earth has over Mars is that it is surrounded by a strong magnetic field driven by the solid iron core dynamo, which deflects/redirects most of that wind.

As for where the gases go, the atoms are pushed into orbit or carried off into interstellar space.  Over a long time, they'll be gravitationally drawn to something like another star, planet, asteroid, or to each other.

Edit: I encourage everyone to read this whole reply thread.  Lots of excellent information and corrections of misconceptions on how atmospheres are lost."
373,"Since we have Long Covid, do we also have ""Long Flu""?","Yes, post-viral symptoms are not unique to COVID-19. By definition, a viral infection weakens the immune system, which can cause all sorts of havoc.

374,How much carbon could be captured by restoring the topsoil in US farmland?,"Looking at just row crops, as that is perhaps the area with the best data and scale, commercial practices plus reduced tillage and cover cropping yield on average 0.5 ton of carbon per acre per year. 

Organic practices are at a much lower scale, but may yield 1.5-3.0 tons per acre (averaged across a rotation) depending on the specific approach to tillage, inputs, rotation, etc. As compelling as that number is, given that organic row crops are still <1% of available acreage, we can overlook it for now. 

There are about 316 million acres of row crops in the U.S. So, with a moderate, very achievable approach towards soil health, we can estimate about 158 million tons of carbon per year. 

However, if farmed to the highest environmental standards, that number shoots up to 948 million tons of carbon per year. 

That said, these yield estimates are still in their infancy. There’s literally no meaningful data to suggest what happens to carbon as soil biology increases over time, and my money is that is where the real yield is gained - perhaps because conventional agriculture kills off soil biology and organic systems just haven’t been studied enough at scale."
375,How can the Webb telescope detect molecules light years away?,"Without having read the article this is afaik done with spectral analysis. Atoms absorb light and reeimit them in ""energy chunks"".

376,How would plants remain intact long enough to get buried and become coal if decomposers and detritivores exist to recycle it?,"The Carboniferous was characterized by very wet conditions, and was rife with gigantic acid bogs. Plants that died and fell into these bogs were preserved against decomposition, much in the same way modern bogs preserve layers upon layers of peat from being decomposed, such that harvested peat deposits can be centuries if not millennia old.

Bogs are extremely anaerobic and decay proceeds very slowly within them, hence very little nutrient recycling or input. This is also why carnivorous plants occur almost exclusively in bogs and swamps - the ability to trap and consume insects was a necessary adaptation to obtain nutrients in substrate almost entirely devoid of nutrition."

378,What determines how much volume vs temperature change when a gas suddenly changes pressure?,"I want to add onto /u/moocow2009 's answer.

Adiabatic compression of a piston is an isentropic process, which means it's completely reversible. If you let go of the piston after compressing, it will return to the original state (maybe because of momentum it will oscillate but the original state will be part of the cycle).

So to find what the pressure temperature volume relationships are, you do an entropy balance, and in thermodynamics entropy S is give by:

dS=dU/T+P/TdV=0

Cv/T dT + R/V dV ==0

Integrate both sides to get

Cv ln T/T0 = R ln V/V0

(T/T0)^(Cv/R)=V/V0

Where Cv is constant volume heat capacity, R is gas constant, T0 and V0 are initial temperature and volume. So now if you have a new V you can find that the new T is:

T=(V/V0)^(R/Cv)*T0

This was all assuming ideal gas. To find pressure, you not have V and T so simply P=RT/V"
379,"Given recent events, which is more dangerous: Deep Sea exploration or Space exploration?","If you consider only the pressure difference in the environment versus the vehicle, then it would seem intuitive that 500 times atmospheric pressure or greater would be more dangerous than a modest one atmosphere gradient.

However, there is so much more to the overall activity that I think history confirms the  greater safety of deep sea research and exploration compared to space. Alvin, for example, had made well over 5000 dives to depths as great as 6500m, although indeed most were shallower. 

The safety difference comes more from reaching the intended study area than being there. The energy expended during launch is incomparable between a rocket and a submersible. Additionally, it seems to me the weight margins for space travel must be much lower than for deep sea access, driving the need to balance a robust exit and reentry vehicle with the practical need to achieve liftoff.

Testing and safety margins must be easier for submersibles. Again, Alvin has a 3-inch thick titanium sphere tested successfully to 1.25 times the maximum operating pressure with no deformation. The delivery system, go down heavy, drop weight to come back light is orders of magnitude more simple. And, if something other than catastrophic failure happens, it is much easier to return. The Navy protocol for deep submergence, P9290, has proven effective for managing operational risk. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) classification system, as well as that of DNV GL have also proven reliable.

It's been a rough week, but I can come back to answer more questions if helpful."
380,"Humo-sapiens branched off about 400,000 years ago are there any genetic changes around 10-20,000 years ago that highlight how we went from hunter gatherers to farmers and gave birth to civilisation?","The whole idea that civilization started quickly and proceeded in one direction is likely false. According to ”The Dawn of Everything” a book by Graeber and Wengrow, humanity has developed farming gradually and many populations of farmers have gone back to being hunter-gatherers without any crisis forcing them to do so.

So no, there were apparently no genetic changes that lead to agriculture and cities, but once wide spread farming of lactating animals was established, it started favoring mutations that lead to lactose tolerance."
381,Why projected global temperature increase is only 1.5 °C when Co2 concentration is at 400ppm?,"More could definitely be said, but two important point to consider:

1. With respect to the CO2 and temperature co-variation during natural periods (i.e., the majority of the posted graph), the key thing to realize is that a fair bit of that temperature variation reflects changes in the amount of solar radiation reaching Earth that varies as a function of various orbital parameters (i.e., [Milankovitch cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles)). The CO2 variations reflect reinforcing feedbacks, i.e., warming starts because of increasing solar radiation leading to various processes releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere that reinforces warming and the reverse, cooling starts because of decreasing solar radiation leading to various processes drawing down CO2 from the atmosphere that reinforces cooling (most of the ""various processes"" have to do with changes in the biosphere and/or ocean). This is why CO2 lags the temperature curve. Returning to the question, when we break this cycle (i.e., when a huge source of CO2 and other greenhouse gases start being pumped into the atmosphere) to the extent that there is a direct and simple correlation between CO2 concentration and average temperature, this new forcing makes direct extrapolation of this prior relationship problematic.

2. Probably even more relevant is the idea of time lags with respect to inputs and effects. CO2, on average, is not that potent a greenhouse gas if we think about the warming potential of a given molecule of CO2 as a function of time. We can see this if we consider [global warming potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential) of other greenhouse gases relative to CO2, where basically most of the other potential greenhouse gases are orders of magnitude more effective at warming. So why the focus on CO2? A few reasons, (1) the concentration of CO2 is generally greater than most of the others and (2) the residence time (i.e., how long it hangs around in the atmosphere) is generally greater than most of the others. So, even though a single CO2 molecule doesn't do as much as say a single molecule of CH4 in terms of warming over a short period, that single CO2 molecule will be around (to contribute to warming) for longer and there's a lot more CO2. This concept of a ""slow burn"" with respect to CO2 is important for your question in that the warming we're experiencing now largely reflects the cumulative effect of decades of CO2 emissions in the past. Similarly, the CO2 emissions we're putting out now will generate warming for decades to centuries into the future. We can see this in considerations of [longer-term projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway#Up_to_2500) considering various future CO2 emission scenarios. For ones where we effectively stop emitting CO2 immediately (e.g., RCP2.6), increasing average temperature continues for decades and temperatures don't start to decline for centuries. **Thus, asking why we only expect X amount of warming by 2030 given the CO2 concentration now is akin to putting a pot of water on the stove, turning on the burner, waiting 5 seconds and then asking why the water isn't boiling yet.**"
382,"Was there any non-avian dinosaurs which decided to return to ocean like how some mammals did (and become whales, dolphins, manatees, seals etc) or did marine reptiles fill that niche so completely that it was basically impossible?","It does not appear so.

Ichthyosaurs appear to have been [fully aquatic a few million years before the end-Permian extinction event](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(22)01990-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098222201990X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), and the sauropterygians (including nothosaurs, placodonts, and later, plesiosaurs) appeared a few million years after. But dinosaurs do not appear to have evolved until *after* both ichthyosaurs *and* sauropterygians—meaning that these other groups were already well-established in the oceans before the *very first* dinosaurs evolved on land. For the early Triassic years of the dinosaurs, the seas were filled with ichthyosaurs (mainly the older, more whale-like shastasaurs) and placodonts, and the shores with nothosaurs...not a lot of niches available for the still-fledgling dinosaurs.

Then, in the last stage of the Triassic, there *might* have been a possible opening, as [the nothosaurs died out and the placodonts dwindled to a single species](http://palaeos.com/mesozoic/triassic/rhaetian.html#Overview). It's unclear whether this die-off happened because of changing environments, a lack of food, or competition from other marine reptiles. But regardless, another group of sauropterygians, the plesiosaurs, rapidly took their place...as did newer, more modern ichthyosaurs.

The tag-team of marine ichthyosaurs and pleisosaurs continued throughout the rest of the Triassic and Jurassic. These two dominated the marine ecosystems and probably served as a deterrent to any non-avian dinosaurs that might have tried moving into a more marine lifestyle.

But at the end of the early Cretaceous, the ""large-bodied marine reptile"" niches experienced a shakeup: [due to climate instabilities, the ichthyosaurs completely died out](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10825), and the plesiosaurs were reduced to a shadow of their former diversity. This opening was the last ""easy"" opportunity the non-avian dinosaurs would have had to move into marine ecosystems...

...but small lizards, already adapted to coastal life, beat them to it. The aigialosaurs were no more than 1 meter long, but following the demise of the icthyosaurs and most plesiosaurs, they *very* rapidly adapted to life in the water, [with two or three different aigialosaur lineages quickly giving rise to the mosasaurs](http://oceansofkansas.com/rapidmosa.html). The mosasaurs were extremely successful for the 25 million years they existed, attaining large populations with a global distribution, and by the end of the Cretaceous the mosasaurs were even beginning to invade *freshwater* ecosystems. They died during the end-Cretaceous extinction along with every other large-bodied animal species, an abrupt end to an *aggressively* successful group of marine reptiles.

So it seems the two best opportunities the non-avian dinosaurs could have taken to adapt to marine living would have been the mid-Triassic and the mid-Cretaceous. But the sauropterygians were already in the water in the Triassic, and filled those available niches...and the aigialosaurs-turned-mosasaurs took such good advantage of the Cretaceous opening that nobody else stood a chance."
383,"If mRNA vaccines train your body to fight diseases, can it train your body to not fight certain things?","Yes, this is an active area of research and there are several promising studies. 

Without going into details, and oversimplifying wildly, the goal of allergy vaccines is to change the nature of an immune response to suppressive rather than inflammatory. (It’s often not understood that active immunity can be suppressive, turning off inflammatory responses.  There are large and highly active branches of the immune system devoted to this active suppression, which can be antigen-specific and non specific.)

Accordingly, in principle it’s possible to use a vaccine, delivered in the right way, to turn on the suppressive response to a particular antigen, which should shut off allergies. It’s tricky, because of course you want to avoid amplifying the ongoing inflammatory response, but it can be done.  

Since these are essentially vaccines, mRNA and DNA can be used to deliver them. For example:  

>	Allergen‐specific immunotherapy, which is performed by subcutaneous injection or sublingual application of allergen extracts, represents an effective treatment against type I allergic diseases. … Plasmid DNA and mRNA vaccines encoding allergens have been shown to induce T helper 1 as well as T regulatory responses, which modulate or counteract allergic T helper 2–biased reactions. … Due to inherent safety features, mRNA vaccines could be the candidates of choice for preventive allergy immunizations. The subtle priming of T helper 1 immunity induced by this vaccine type closely resembles responses of non‐allergic individuals and—by boosting via natural allergen exposure—could suffice for long‐term protection from type I allergy.

It can also be done as a preventive, in say children with the genetic tendency to develop allergies:

>	Our data clearly indicate that mRNA vaccination against Phl p 5 induces robust, long-lived memory responses, which can be recalled by allergen exposure without side effects. mRNA vaccines fulfill the requirements for safe prophylactic vaccination without the need for booster immunizations.

387,how does brain activity start in a fetus?,[removed]
388,Why do we experience two high tides per day instead of just one? The moon only orbits Earth once per day.,"This is a little trickier of a question than people perhaps realise as there is some subtlety here. 

&nbsp;

The tidal force is a differential force, and a simple one dimensional model can give insight as to why there might be two tidal deformations (bulges). If you imagine a perfectly spherical ball (the primary) with a global ocean of uniform depth, now imagine the object is influenced by a distant point mass. This point mass will have some gravitational potential associated with it and hence tidal force will be applied to the primary. Now if you consider the side of the primary closest to the point mass and remember that gravity is weaker with distance, the surface of the ocean will feel a strong pull towards the point mass than the base of the ocean due to proximity. This is a stretching force which is stretching in the direction of the point mass. Now if we consider the side of the primary opposite the point mass we have that the base of the ocean is being pulled more than the surface since the base is closer than the surface. Again this is a stretching force but you can kind of think of the surface of the ocean as being left behind. As such there is a deformation on the far side and hence two deformations.

&nbsp;

A more rigorous treatment of this requires writing down the tidal potential and taking its gradient to get the tidal force. This is a bit messy as it involves an infinite series of Legendre polynomials. However, [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Field_tidal.svg/2560px-Field_tidal.svg.png) is a nice picture of what the leading order term looks like (note this is only the l=m=2 spherical harmonic component of the tide and is invariant along the rotational axis). You can clearly see the force diagram has a stretching at the near and far sides.

&nbsp;

So this crudely takes on the question of why there are two deformations. Subtly this does not answer why there are two tides daily. If we neglect any dissipation in the system then the tidal deformation will respond instantaneously to the tidal forcing. That is, the deformations will be aligned with the line of centers (the line between the center of the Earth and Moon for example). If the orbital period of the Moon is the same as the rotational period of the Earth then the Moon would orbit the Earth above a fixed location. However, in the real world the Earths spin period and the Moons orbital period are different so the location closest/furthest from the Moon (where the tidal deformations are centered around) move. 

&nbsp;

As a minor detail, the Earth day is approximately 23 hours 56 minutes, while the tidal period is 24 hours 50 minutes. The discrepancy being that both the Earth is spinning and the Moon is orbiting. If you set it up magically that the Moon was static in space and the Earth just spun in place, then you would get approximately 23 hours 56 minutes as the tidal period."
389,What happens to air when sucked into space?,"It spreads very, very thinly out as far as it can go. 

Gasses expand to fill their container, and space is a VERY large container. 

Eventually if there is a large object nearby they will be pulled towards it by gravity but that's more long term."
390,"Do all herbivores possess 4 stomachs like a cow, or is the cow completely unique?","The short answer: no to both. 

The longer answer: the cow is not unique, being in the category of herbivore known as ruminant, which means simply that the animal possesses a rumen. They are called foregut digesters, because their digestion goes through multiple stages before entering the hindgut. Other animals which experience foregut fermentation (the proper term for the process) include not only other ruminants such as goats and sheep and rhinoceros, but also some rodents and marsupials.

Animals with hindgut fermentation can be herbivores. Rabbits and horses are hindgut digesters, as examples. So not all herbivores possess a rumen, but the cow is not completely unique.

Longer and more detailed answer: The cow does not have four stomachs; what it actually has is four separate parts of one digestive system, not counting intestine, etc, said parts being rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum.  There are two general types of bacteria for digestion in the rumen of a cow: amylolytic bacteria, which break down starch,  and cellulolytic bacteria, which break down cellulose. Feed is chewed up by the cow and ends up as a fibrous mat floating at the top of the rumen, where the cellulolytic bacteria goes to work breaking it down into smaller particles which sink lower, to where the amylolytic bacteria go to work. 

The balance of these bacteria is very important as too much starch will cause serious, potentially deadly problems for the cow  as the cellulolytic bacteria reproduce more slowly than the amylolytic bacteria can. Starvation of the cellulolytic bacteria because of too much starch and not enough cellulose coincides with rapid reproduction of the amylolytic bacteria which will then fall to starvation as they digest all the starch available and begin to die off, creating gases that increase pressure in the cow's abdomen (the condition called bloat). Once this condition is too far advanced the cow will enter lactic acidosis - by which point treatment is rarely successful."

We recognize that this is a major news story that has received significant coverage, and that this was a highly unusual situation in extreme conditions.

392,Will filling an inflatable boat with helium or hydrogen make it more buoyant?,"Technically yes, but the difference is small enough that it's not worth it.

The density of water is approximately 1,000 kg/m^3 (depending on temperature, salinity, etc...). The density of air at room temperature is about 1.2 kg/m^3 and the density of hydrogen is about 0.09 kg/m^(3).

Now the difference between hydrogen and air seems huge, more than a factor 10. But what ultimately matters for buoyancy is the difference between the density of water and the density of the object you're trying to make float, which is the combination of the boat materials and whatever is used to inflate it.

Compared to water and the solid materials the boat is made from, the contribution of the gas used to inflate the boat is negligible. So for the purposes of buoyancy, it really doesn't matter which gas you use to inflate the boat. And that's why air is used, because it's everywhere, safe and easy to handle."
393,How do learned traits evolve to become instinct?,"Loosely, we consider instincts to be genetically specified and not require learning (but in practice many behaviours are both). In that sense, learned traits don't evolve to become instinct.

However, there is one way in which this could happen, called the [Baldwin effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_effect). Say, for example, that an animal learned to rinse its food in water before eating. By so doing, it removed some bacteria and decreased its chance of infection. This clever animal would have an advantage, but it would not be passed on via evolution because its offspring would not inherit the behaviour.

But suppose that other animals begin to copy this behaviour and learn it for themselves. The behaviour now spreads, perhaps to the whole group and through the generations. There has been a behavioural change, but no evolution yet. If this washing lasts long enough, a random mutation might crop up that causes washing behaviour, and this might be advantageous  as you don't have to spend time learning like everyone else. This behaviour now spreads via genetic inheritance, and we get an evolutionary change.

The Baldwin effect is quite mysterious and controversial and hard to demonstrate, but in theory at least, it could work."
394,Does water bubble in space?,"[NASA has a video demonstration of exactly this!](https://youtu.be/kdt20h0ZaDw)

Basically, because there is no vertical pressure gradient in zero-g water, the bubbles aren’t pushed “up”…instead, water’s strong surface tension means they join up with each other and create a kind of super-bubble inside the water."
395,How do animals evolve behaviors?,"A single turtle, or group of turtles never spontaneously decided to sit still. It’s that the ones that never did were eaten and thus could not reproduce. Over many many generations these traits are acquired. 

How does the cell know to reproduce? Complex molecular signaling, including the ability to sense the environment around. The cells that do this best are proliferated by way of natural selection. 

What is comprehension or thought other than complex cellular signaling? We are all just bags of salty water.

Through millions of years and countless generations of species these traits are acquired."

399,Is there a causal link between solar flaring/sunspots and seismic activity?,"Ok, first a somewhat pedantic, but potentially relevant point. The referenced paper by [Marchitelli et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67860-3) is published in *Scientific Reports* **not** *Nature*. They are both published by Springer Nature (along with a *a lot* of other journals), but the latter is one of the most respected journals in the scientific community (for better or worse) and the former is a journal published by the same publisher that has a [relatively questionable track record in terms of what they have published and/or editorial/review practices](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/more-scientific-reports-and-faked-papers). Now, this is not to say that everything published in Nature is above reproach and everything published in Scientific Reports is garbage and that we can then simply disregard the Marchitelli paper solely on the basis of its publication venue, but: (1) publication venue can be relevant as it can provide a first-order sense of the level of scrutiny (i.e., peer review) a given paper has received and (2) it is disingenuous to present all things published by Springer Nature as being ""published in Nature"" as this implies a level of scrutiny potentially not afforded publications in ""lesser"" Springer Nature journals (fully recognizing that metrics like impact factor are very problematic when used to assess quality either of a journal or individual papers published within that journal).

Publication venue aside, with respect to the claims of this article, it's worth starting with a recognition that finding patterns within and/or correlations between a noisy and *very* incomplete sampling (where the incomplete sampling aspect reflects that we are looking at *very short* timeframes for processes that play out over *much longer* time frames) of a stochastic process (i.e., earthquakes) and other phenomena is a pretty challenging exercise. This is discussed a bit in one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_rates/), but I'd specifically highlight [Daub et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JB011777). They focus on clustering of earthquakes (as opposed to correlations between earthquakes and outside phenomena) but the general point of this paper is relevant, namely that depending on how you filter the earthquake data (e.g., how you choose to remove known auto-correlations or do not) you can get *very different* results. For example, the choice in the original Marchitelli paper to not ""decluster"" the earthquake catalog, i.e., attempt to remove events that will show auto-correlation with other events, namely aftershock sequences, provides a challenge to interpreting their results - i.e., do they see a pattern and correlation because they do not rigorously treat their data?. To be fair, the [same authors](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2020.595209/full) have a follow up paper where they consider a declustered version of the catalog where they still find a correlation, but that they thought it was appropriate to publish (and that the reviewers didn't flag this as a huge issue) their initial paper with a non-declustered catalog is worrying, to say the least, as it suggests either at best a lack of expertise with respect to proper statistical treatments of earthquake data or at worst a willful attempt to find a correlation regardless of whether a meaningful one exists.

More worrying still, is that neither of their two papers from this group on this really test a true null hypothesis, i.e., if we compare a truly random set of events drawn from a distribution like the one we expect for earthquakes and compare it to a periodic signal (like solar intensity), what's the chance that we'll find a similar (but meaningless) correlation as they find? [Akhoondzadeh & De Santis, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/7/1131) (published by MDPI, a publisher with its own sordid past and questionable practices) performed such an analysis and basically found that you could reproduce the level of correlation the original authors found between earthquake and solar flare when there is 100% no actual relationship between the two signals. Does this for sure mean that the original claim by Marchitelli and others is wrong? No, not necessarily, but it does indicate that we should look on their results with a pretty healthy level of skepticism.

At the broadest level, geologists and seismologists have in the past, and continue to, search for meaningful precursor signals to earthquakes. At present, really none of these have either held up to further scrutiny (e.g., better consideration of the statistics) or proven useful in a predictive or forecasting sense. On that last point, there are various phenomena that do appear to unambiguously influence seismicity, e.g., [various seasonal changes in waterloads](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_seasons/) or [aspects of the solid Earth tide](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquakes_tides/) among others, but critically, none of these really provide useful predictions from a hazards perspective. What I mean is that, even if we know ""X"" leads to an increased probability of earthquakes of a given magnitude, if that probability is distributed over a wide temporal range and at global or even regional scales - as opposed to something like this thing will increase the likelihood of a large earthquake at this exact spot on this exact fault over this exact time frame- then while potentially scientifically interesting, it's not actually useful from a hazards perspective. Returning to the solar flare example, even if we could say with 100% certainty that a large solar flare leads to a global increased probability of a large magnitude earthquake, what is the actionable response? Is everyone anywhere near a fault capable of generating a large earthquake supposed to go on heightened alert every time there is a solar flare?"
400,"When heating up the oven chamber, is most of the energy getting stored in in the air or the metal?","Most of the heat is stored in the metal and other solid components.

And the reason is what you've already alluded to: The heat capacity difference.

Air has a specific heat capacity of about 1 J/(g K) (meaning that it takes 1 J to heat up 1 gram of air by 1 Kelvin). Now I don't know exactly what materials an oven is made of, but lets go for steel. This is mostly an order of magnitude argument anyway, so the exact details are less important for the general point I'm trying to make. Steel has a specific heat capacity of about 0.47 J/(g K). ([source for heat capacities](https://gchem.cm.utexas.edu/data/section2.php?target=heat-capacities.php))

Wait a minute. That's less than half of that of air? What's up with that?

Note that the heat capacity here is measured based on the mass of the substance. And air is obviously far less dense than steel. A quick Google search suggests that standard consumer ovens have an average volume of about 60 liters. At room temperature, the density of air is about 1.2 kg/m^3 or 1.2 g/l ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_of_air)).

That means that the 60 l oven will have about 72 grams of air, which has a heat capacity of about 72 J/K. It takes only about 150 grams of steel to retain the same amount of heat at a given temperature as the total air volume of the oven. And compared to the total mass of the oven, 150 grams is very little (even if you consider that parts of the oven are insulated from the interior and don't contribute to heat retention nearly as much).

There's a lot of handwaving in this calculations. I just assumed a single solid material and values were taken at room temperature (which an active oven is not). But while these assumptions affect the exact value of the outcome, they don't change the overall picture that the solid parts of the oven will retain many times more heat than the air contained within it."

402,Does gravity seem stronger (weaker) at smaller (larger) scales?,"When it comes to gravity, it doesn't actually change just because you're bigger or smaller. The force of gravity depends on two things: the mass of the objects and the distance between them. So, even if you were to magically grow six times taller but keep the same mass, gravity would still pull you down at the same rate.

You're right that if you're larger, an object falling from your hand would take longer to hit the ground. That's not because gravity is weaker, but because the object has further to fall. Imagine dropping a pencil from a skyscraper versus from your hand. It'll take longer from the skyscraper, but that's because of the greater distance, not weaker gravity.

When it comes to movies like Godzilla or Ant-Man, they sometimes bend the laws of physics a bit for the sake of drama. Ant-Man, for example, shouldn't be crushed when he shrinks because gravity doesn't work that way.

So, to sum up: gravity doesn't change if you're bigger or smaller. If you grew or shrunk but kept your same mass, gravity would pull on you just the same. It's all about the mass and the distance, not your size!"
403,What is the smallest possible black hole?,"Caveat emptor: I am a theoretical physicist but not an astrophysicist.

As I understand, the minimum mass for a black hole is conjectured to be on the order of the Planck mass, which is about 2x10^(-8) kg (much heavier than an atom). This corresponds to a Schwarzschild radius (characteristic black hole size) on the order of a Planck length—about 10^(-34) m, much smaller than an atom (~10^(-10) m) as claimed in the link.

The Planck mass is defined in terms of Planck's constant, the universal gravitational constant, and the speed of light, and can be roughly understood as a mass scale where gravity gains a quantum nature (which is to say, where we don't understand what's going on at all). 

The reason for this lower bound is Hawking radiation: Stephen Hawking showed that black holes slowly emit particles and energy, which in principle (after a long, long time) will cause them to evaporate, as long as they aren't absorbing any more matter. A Planck mass black hole would emit particles with the same mass-energy as the black hole itself, so it would be unstable. 

However, like I said, this is conjectural. We don't really know what happens when a black hole is that small, because quantum gravity effects presumably are very important.

> What is the mass required to achieve an atom sized black hole?

A Schwarzschild radius of 10^(-10) m corresponds to a mass of about ~5x10^16 kg, in fact quite a bit more massive than a mountain (Everest is ~10^15 kg). 

> How do multiple atoms even fit in the space of a single atom?

First off, the mass itself is believed to be confined to a *singularity,* which is to say a point in space with no physical size. Multiple atoms of course cannot fit in a singularity, so indeed the matter (as we know it, anyway) will be destroyed during gravitational collapse, leaving only their mass.

> If the universe was peppered with “supermicro” black holes, then would we be able to detect them?

Not sure. I think we would be able to detect the presence of their mass, but it's unclear if we would have a way to identify them definitively as black holes. For this reason, one kind of micro black hole is hypothesized by some physicists to be a dark matter candidate."
404,Do astronauts loose hair cause problems on the ISS?,"This is indeed a big consideration if it comes to operating spacecraft. The air is being kept moving to prevent the formation of CO2 bubbles and to keep dust particles (such as hair) from floating around. You don't want the astronauts breathing in the wrong stuff.

So, the air is moved around by a lot of fans. The station is quite the noisy place because of this. There's also a bunch of air filters to clean up the circulating air, and one of the astronaut's duty is maintaining them (vacuuming, seal checks, etc..)."
405,How does water spread into the ground after watering plants?,"This is called drainage. Depending on soil type, water can percolate quickly and run off through the soil or it can be retained in soil and stay in place.

This is also why it’s bad to grow plants in unperforated pots because without drainage, water can’t run off and pools at the bottom, creating anaerobic conditions and plant decay."
406,How do we know it takes 365 days around the sun?,"The seasons (a tropical year of 365.242 days, the same as our calendar) are coming from the motion around the Sun, so it's not coincidence that seasons and orbit have the same period. [Here is an illustration](https://www.weather.gov/fsd/season).

We can directly measure Earth's orbital period of 365.256 days by measuring the orientation of Earth and Sun relative to distant stars. It is slightly different from the seasonal cycle because of precession, but that difference is only ~20 minutes/year."
407,"When making an epigenetic change to DNA, how do RNA and the chemicals/enzymes used for it “know” which genes to target?","Effector proteins, transcription factors, DNA binding proteins and other regulatory proteins and RNAs will have different binding affinities towards segments of DNA. If say the DNA is methylated at a certain regulatory site the structure of that region of DNA and nucleosomoes will have a higher chemical binding affinity for a repressor protein which then Cascades a signal or physically prevents RNA polymerase from reading the DNA. Absence of the repressive epigenetic signal can increase the binding of activating enzymes etc to turn genes on.

Chemical signals can come from many places and a lot of signals start with a chemical effector binding to a protein and caused a phosphorylation cascade that reaches the nucleus to turn on/off activators and repressors to then target DNA binding sites."
408,Why is sealevel higher where gravity is higher?,"The local gravity doesn't just pull down, it's pulling sideways too (you don't feel it as it evens out).

This also means that it’s not permanent and if we stopped fighting mosquitoes so much, there’s a chance it could return."
410,We're any dinosaurs frugivores (diet consisting or mainly fruits and seeds)?,"We do not know of any dinosaurs that were strictly or primarily frugivorous…but [analysis of wear patterns and pitting on dinosaur teeth](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098605) has suggested that ankylosaurs ate fruit at least sometimes, and more frequently than, say, their nodosaur cousins. And the hadrosaurs they studied appear to have eaten basically everything, fruit included.

It has been *proposed* that [*Oviraptor* was frugivorous](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320986075_Oviraptorosaur_anatomy_diversity_and_ecology_in_the_Nemegt_Basin), but this has not been without controversy, and we have found at least one *Oviraptor* with a lizard in its stomach."
411,How fast does the major axis of the Earth's orbit rotate around the sun?,"Yes, your guess is correct. If the Earth and the Sun were perfect spheres, and there were no other objects in the solar system, then Earth's elliptical orbit would stay fixed - a perfect ""Keplerian"" ellipse. But Earth's orbit gets slightly bumped around by all the other stuff in the solar system - particularly Jupiter - and the net effect is that the orbit slowly ""precesses"" around the Sun. The closest point to the Sun is the perihelion (the most distant point is the aphelion), so the term to Google here is the ""precession of the perihelion"".

For actual numbers, [here](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/Newton/node115.html) is a random university textbook level summary of precession, and check out table 2. This gives the observed precession of each planet in arcseconds per year (along with an estimate based on undergraduate level theory, which is sometimes not very accurate). One arc second is a 1/3600th of a degree. Here, Earth's rate of precession is 11.45 arcseconds per year. This comes out to a full loop about every 100,000 years.

The precession of the perihelion of Mercury is worth noting here. This is also mostly caused by the same effects - Jupiter etc - but when precise calculations were made, they always came out just a couple percent off. This actually turned out to be an early success of General Relativity, where gravity in GR is just a little bit different from classical ""Newtonian"" gravity, and using GR calculations gave the right correction for Mercury's precession."
412,Do bird songs change over long periods of time?,"Darwin’s finches have been observed to change their songs in as little as one generation, [when a new finch species entered their habitat.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1015115107)

In their case, this was a mating call…and the point of a mating call is not just to sound attractive but also to differentiate yourself from other species (so you attract a mate of the *same* species as you). If other birds with a similar call show up, individual birds will adjust their calls enough to stand out, in ways that are measurably different from their dads’ calls. 

More broadly, we see bird calls changing across geography just like human language does…[bird populations that are a little ways apart have slightly different calls](https://royalsociety.org/blog/2021/11/how-do%20bird-songs-evolve-over-time/#:~:text=Like%20human%20language%2C%20bird%20song,from%20one%20city%20to%20another.).

415,Why do we feel pain/cramps in muscles a day or two after we do a workout at the gym?,"So there is evidence still for the microtear theory (z-line streaming, dystrophin damage, etc) but it doesn’t have to happen to experience hypertrophy, and maybe not DOMS either. But we absolutely know that myokines released locally by the exercising muscle are capable of calling in immune cells to help modulate the exercise response. Cells like macrophages release further signaling molecules drawing more pro-inflammatory cells to the area (numbers peak 24-48 hours after exercise). Many of these cells hypersensitive nociceptors (nerve endings that detect pain). In a normal extracellular milieu, a small bump to the tissue over the muscle wouldn’t activate the pain receptors, but in a DOMS area with multiple inflammatory cells causing nociceptor hypersensitization, a stimulus that isn’t likely to cause any damage is sensed as pain (I.e light pressure on or bump of the leg)."
416,Were all dinosaurs feathered?,"Wikipedia has a pretty good [graphic/summary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feathered_dinosaur).
We've found feathers or proto-feathers in theropods such as yutyrannus; in ornithiscians such as psittacosaurus, heterodontosaurs, kulindadromeusn and feather analogues in several pterosaurs. It is most likely that the genetics to produce these filaments is ancestral to the entire group. The feathered fossils we have found all belong to fairly basal animals of different groups, further supporting this.
Feathers and scales are developmentally related (see the scutes on bird feet) so there would have likely been a huge amount of variation. Dinosaurs like psittacosaurus had a small and specific row of fuzz, probably for display, while heterodontosaurus had pretty extensive coverage. Larger species are less likely to have full coverage due to body heat. Nanuqsaurus and pachyrhinosaurs have no known feathers but are usually depicted with them due to their environment. Many skin impressions preserve definite scales and scutes. But the presence of scales doesn't necessarily rule out feathers, which are likely to be lost during decomposition.
  
So while all dinosaurs likely had the capacity to be feathered, many were probably not in any noticeable way."
417,If something is at absolute 0° (0K) then would it not have any pressure?,"In the context of the ideal gas law yes the pressure would be zero at absolute zero. 

The thinking is: Ignoring particle interactions and finite volumes, at absolute zero the molecules/ atoms would have zero velocity. Thus there would be no collisions with the walls of your container and no pressure.

In reality, materials don’t follow the ideal gas law in particular due to intermolecular interactions (and QM). The descriptions of “temperature” and “pressure” and how they’re related will be different to the ideal gas law."
418,Why doesn’t the water drain out through the bottom of a mud puddle?,"There's an evaporation rate and a rate that water seeps into the soil. As the other commenter mentioned, the rate water seeps into the ground is dependent on the soil properties as well as the saturation of water in the soil.

So it depends, but sometimes, the evaporation rate can be magnitudes larger. 

To make a leak-resistant bottom, follow the other commenter's advice- you'll have to line it with a 'natural' bottom that isn't very porous."
419,Is it possible that Pi repeats at some point?,"Pi is an [irrational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number), one of the properties of an irrational number is that its decimal representation never ends nor repeats itself.

So, this raises the question (1) how do we know irrational numbers don't have repeating decimals and (2) how do we know pi is irrational. 

To answer the first one. First, what is an irrational number? An irrational number is a number which cannot be expressed a a fraction of two whole numbers. Easy example, 3/8 = 0.375 is a rational number, but something like the sqrt(2) is irrational- there is no fraction of whole numbers which will exactly equal the sqrt(2). This is one of the first proofs you will learn in analysis, and [it is pretty easy to follow to see why](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/euclid-square-root-2-irrational.html). So, how do we know no irrational number has repeating decimals? Because if it did, it could be expressed as the ratio of 2 whole numbers. To steal the example from the above link, let's say we have the number 0.7162162162.... and we want to prove it's not irrational. Well, the algorithm to find the rational expression of it is:

(1) Call the original number A = 0.7162162162... We see there is 1 number before the repeating starts, so multiple the number of 10^1, thus saying 10A =  7.162162162...

(2) Now, we see that the repeating part is 3 decimals long, so, we also calculate (10^(3))\*10A = 10,000A = 7162.162162...

(3) Subtract 10,000A from 10A and get 10,000A-10A = 9,990A = 7,155

(4) And thus, A = 7155/9990. Thus, 0.7162162162... is rational

So, that's one example, but the process is the same, no matter what the length of the repeating is. So, we have shown that no irrational numbers have repeating decimals. 

So, we're left to prove number 2 from above- that Pi is irrational. That is harder. In fact, I don't know any proof for them which I could easily type out here, using the limited formatting options Reddit provides. But, [there is a series of proofs on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_that_%CF%80_is_irrational) if you want to read any of them.

420,How exactly did the changes from Old High German to Middle High German during the 11th century actually happen and how aware were the people about these things?,"The second sound shift defined Old High German as different from Low German. Old High German wasn't really a supra-regional form of OHG, so it wasn't the same everywhere. Language wasn't really standardized back then, and regional dialects were everywhere. In general, language is always very fluid, and small changes add up over time, and the people using them are usually unaware. That's why it takes hundreds of years to evolve from one to the next, and the old language can still exist at the same time. Look at Miami, FL. They have a unique dialect that is the result of Spanish speakers learning English and English speakers picking up in some Spanish. Things like ""get down from the car""  instead of ""get out of the car"" are common there, because of direct translation from Spanish to English. Even for people not from Miami, that's not so strange  of a change that we don't get their meaning. In 300 years, how much will that dialect have evolved? Will it be a new form of English? Who can say?"
421,Is the speed of light relative to the observer? How does travel in space work?,"The basis of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) is that all observers will measure the speed of light to be 'c' (aka, ~3e8 m/s). I think the most succinct way of describing it is this thought experiment. 

First, let's think of an example not using light. You are driving in a tank that can drive at 50 m/s (fast tank), and the tank can shoot a shell that travels 500 m/s. You are driving in the tank, I am on the ground as you drive past me and shoot your gun. What do we both see? You see the shell traveling away from you at 500 m/s. I, however, see the shell traveling at 550 m/s- the shell inherits the speed from the tank, and the velocities add together. (Side note, but if you want to see an example of this, but just in reverse, there is this cool [Mythbuster video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuI118nhzc) where they shoot a ball out the back of a truck, where the truck is traveling at the speed the ball is shot, so the ball appears just to fall straight down). This is regular physics, behaving probably how most people think physics works. 

But now, say I am on Earth, and you are on a spaceship, and your spaceship is traveling at 99% the speed of light relative to Earth. You turn on a flashlight. What do we both see?

You see something similar to what you saw in the tank example up above. You would still measure the light leaving your spaceship at 'c', just like you saw in the tank the shell leaving at it's speed, 500 m/s. 

But for me, things are different. I see you traveling at 99% c, and the light traveling at 'c', so the light will be going 1% faster than you. That is, if you turned on a laser pointer and pointed it at something 300,000,000 km away, I would see the light there there in 100 seconds, and you would get there in 101 seconds- the light is traveling 1% faster than you.

This is the basis of special relativity, and all of the other attributes of special relativity can actually be derived from the fact that everyone measures the same speed of light, and adding in- we both have to agree on what happened. So, how does this work? How can we both measure something traveling at 'c' but you see it getting out in front of you way faster than I do? Well, this is where length contraction and time dilation come in. Me, on Earth seeing you zoom by, will see a clock on your spaceship ticking slower than a clock next to me ([time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation)), and that sensor the laser pointer is hitting that's 300M m away? You will measure it to be less than 300 M m away ([length contraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction)). So, the trade off for us both measuring the same speed of light, is we no longer have the same time or length measurements. 

A very important result of all of this is the axiom ""there are no preferred inertial frame."" This is a way of saying ""there is no universal rest frame, any frame which is inertial (which just means, not accelerating) is equally valid."" Because since the speed of light is always measured at 'c' by everyone, there is no way to say ""I am at rest, because I measure the speed of light to be it's ""true"" speed, and you are not at rest because you measure a different speed."" No, any inertial frame is equally valid. It's just as valid to say, as I sit at my desk, that I am stationary as it is to say I am traveling at 99.999999% the speed of light. 

This is all related to your first question- can you have an infinite velocity with infinite fuel? And the answer is no- no one will ever travel faster than the speed of light. An easy way to know? Well, let's say you were traveling at 'c' as measured by me, on Earth, and you turned on your flashlight. Now, I would have to see you, and the light traveling at the same speed- aka, the light is not getting out in front of you at all. But you have to see the light leaving away from you at 'c'. There is no amount of length contraction and time dilation that can account for that. Thus, it is impossible to travel at the speed of light."
422,How does Mercury's orbit prove Einstein's theory of Gravitational Relativity?,"Prior to general relativity, gravity was understood using Newton's law of gravitation. Newton's laws let you predict the behaviour of two masses orbiting one other, like Mercury and the Sun, and for the simple case of two masses, where they're gravitationally bound to one another (i.e. when they're not moving faster than escape velocity), it predicts that the shape of the orbit will be an ellipse (or a circle, but an ellipse is a stretched circle so a circle is a kind of ellipse). If one body is much more massive than the other, like the Sun is compared to Mercury, then the heavier will essentially stay still and the other body will be the only one moving in an ellipse. In the ideal case, this ellipse stays where it is, and the lighter body goes around the heavier body on a path that meets up with itself after every orbit, so it's perfectly repeating.

However, you essentially never have the ideal case. Mercury isn't the only planet, and its motion is affected by the gravity of other planets. This is only a small effect, but generally speaking, when you apply a small perturbation like that to an elliptical orbit, it causes the ellipse to start rotating around, so that after each orbit it no longer meets up with itself, but is rotated slightly further around the heavier body. This is called precession. There are diagrams to this effect in the video.

Now, physicists at the time were able to work out how big the effect of the other planets was, and they found that, according to Newton's law of gravitation, it should precess by about 15% of a degree per century. That's not very much, it's about 1 degree every 700 years or a full rotation roughly every 250000 years. Still, astronomers had good enough telescopes that they were able to measure it, and they found that the rate of precession was about 16% of a degree per century, it was 1% of a degree too large. It's only a small error, but it was difficult to explain, because they were very confident in both their experimental measurements and their theoretical calculations.

At this point, Einstein comes along, with a new theory of gravity, general relativity. It's much more mathematically complicated than Newton's law, but physicists were able to use it to predict the behaviour of one small mass orbiting a much larger mass, the same setup that under Newton's law gave us the perfect repeating ellipse. When you use general relativity to solve the same problem, what you end up with is the same as with Newton's laws, plus a very small additional extra attractive force, and this extra force doesn't follow the same relationship between force and distance as Newtonian gravity (Newtonian gravity goes like 1/r^(2), but this new extra force goes like 1/r^(3)). This small extra force causes additional precession, on top of the precession caused by the other planets. When scientists plugged in the numbers for the Sun and Mercury, and worked out the size of this additional precession, they found that it almost exactly explained the missing 1% from the Newtonian prediction. Their experimental measurements were right all along, and it was their theoretical prediction that was wrong, not because they'd done the calculations wrong, but because the theory itself wasn't quite accurate. As a result of this, as well as a few other tests, general relativity supplanted Newton's law of gravity as our most accurate theory of gravitation."
423,Why do lakes that high up in the Andes contain salt water ?,"The salt in both the oceans and saline lakes both ultimately come from the same place. Salt naturally occurs in low concentrations in many kinds of rocks, when these rocks weather the salt is washed out by rain and into rivers and streams. The water continues migrating downstream until it eventually reaches the low point of the system, usually the ocean but sometimes an endorheic lake (one with no further outflow). Water leaves the ocean and these basins mainly via evaporation, which leaves the salt behind. Over time the salt level slowly builds up. The thing the ocean and almost all saltwater lakes have in common is that they have no significant outflow besides evaporation, once the salt is there it can't be washed away."
424,How in the world is behavior (instinct) encoded into DNA?,"I am out of uni for 3 y and never looked too much into neuroscience, but took a lot of genetic lectures...

425,When alcohol degreases something where does the oil go?,"In short - Alcohols are Amphiphilic; meaning that it can bind with both polar and non-polar things.  In a polar bond, one atom is positively charged and the other is negatively charged. A molecule (or a polyatomic ion) is polar when one side of the molecule is more positive (or more negative) than the other. This makes it perfet to work with fats, since they are non-polar.

So when you start cleaning with alcohol, because of it's Amphiphilic properties, it gets mixed well between the long fatty acid chains (what grease is made out of) and sticks with it. This basically dissolves the packed ""chains"", by getting in between the fatty molecules, which is then washed away by the alcohol/cloth/other cleaning agent."
426,When did tarantulas lose the ability to produce silk / weave webs?,"Tarantulas haven't *lost* their ability to to make silk, they just don't weave webs anymore having specialised in capturing prey using different methods. However it's this sort of change which leads to the loss of unnecessary abilities, resulting in speciation: long-term evolution. But right now they still have working spinnerettes which still get used."

428,If you charge a battery does it gain mass as it gains more energy?,"In principle, adding energy to the battery (at rest) will increase its mass. In practice there are tons of other processes that can change its mass by much more than this small difference. A speck of dust being added to or removed from its exterior, for example.

There are also battery types that exchange gas with the atmosphere, like [lithium-air batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93air_battery). They get (measurably!) lighter when they are charged because they lose oxygen."
429,Can a quasi-star develop a stable crust?,"No. A quasi-star can only exist for as long as it is in equilibrium. The outer layers' inward fall is opposed by the radiant pressure from the black hole's accretion.

This equilibrium can only exist at temperatures in the thousands of degrees, with a lower limit somewhere around 5000K on the surface. If the surface gets any cooler than that, the plasma and gas is too dense to stay suspended, and the quasi-star soon collapses into its central hole.

At those surface temperatures, no substances would be solid."

Over the winter any day that it is above 50 they will go out and come back with pollen.

433,What evolutionary advantage is there for your teeth to cause pain?,"These answers are kind of wild.

Ok so I'm a dentist and I'll give my 2 cents.

So first of all, the nerves that tell you that you are biting are not IN the tooth, but *around* the tooth -- specifically in the periodontal ligament.  This is a thin layer of tissue that stretches, and that stretching or compression tell your brain what you are chewing is either soft or hard. If I put a blindfold on you and put something in your mouth like a potato chip and you bite down, you know immediately that it's crispy and you adjust your force accordingly.   A denture does not give this feedback.  There are lots of studies to show that chewing with dentures is decidedly worse than real teeth, and this is a principle reason.

Ok so the chewing and feedback is from around the tooth -- the connection between the tooth and the jawbone.  What about the nerves *INSIDE* the teeth?  Why do you feel pain there?

Teeth are *alive*. They feel temperature. There is blood inside the tooth.  The tooth *lays down more dentin throughout our lives*, making the dentin layer thicker and the pulp layer thinner.  The reason it's there in the first place is because that's how your tooth was made.

I'm simplifyung things, but have two types of hard tissue-making cells for your tooth.  The first at ameloblasts, the second are odontoblasts.  They are buddies until the start growing your tooth.  The former grows OUT, and the later grows IN, and KEEPS GROWING IN until the tooth dies or there is essentially no pulp left.

Note: if your pulp gets SUPER thin, you can't feel temperature anymore.

So why do you feel pain inside?  Because it's messing with the tooth trying to make more dentin -- something is messing up the process.  Bacteria, trauma, etc.  Bacteria make abscesses in teeth, and that hurts.  Putting pressure on that tooth will injure it more.  Teeth are special in that it won't get better on its own, mostly because the blood supply inside the tooth sucks, so your immune response sucks."
434,Does our changing position in the galaxy have similar effects to our changing position around the sun?,"The foundation of your question becomes: 1) What is the closest we get to other stars / solar systems, and 2) At that close range, does their heat/gravity/etc have any meaningful effect on our planet?

This isn't my field of expertise, but I would hazard a guess that space is much less dense than you might think. Furthermore, many of the forces at play (e.g. gravity), are quite importantly \*inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass\*, which means at great distances their effect quickly approaches 0. Put another way, being twice as far from the sun doesn't mean you get half the gravitational pull, but actually a fourth (1/2 \^ 2). And being 100x the distance from the sun means you get 1/10,000x the gravitational force.

Light has a similar inversely proportional relationship to distance. Here's a short article that might be fun to explore: [https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/cosmicengine/stars\_luminosity.html](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/cosmicengine/stars_luminosity.html) ."
435,Impacts of sea salt industry on the environment?,"Do you mean by reducing salinity?

436,Can we derive fluorescence lifetime measurement from emission spectra?,"It depends on how the emission is collected. For example, if you don't have access to a sensitive setup like TCSPC, a boxcar averaging approach might work, which is essentially piecing together multiple steady-state measurements.

See [here](https://medium.com/@mattchiriboga1/using-the-levenberg-marquardt-algorithm-to-fit-multi-component-fluorescence-lifetime-decay-data-2ce06152fbf6) for example. 

Other than that, I don't know of any way to derive lifetime insights directly from a steady-state emission spectrum."

Tl;dr - it doesn't ""kill"" the microbiome, but it can alter it and affect skin health. 

This was the only study I could find that looked specifically at pool swimming (vs ocean, which had another publication) and skin microbiome (vs gut microbiome, which had several publications.)

It's mainly focused on an organism causing ""swimmer's acne,"" but you can extrapolate a bit and predict there would be other short-term shifts in bacterial populations that may be more long-term with regular swimming."
438,I heard recently that being fat and then losing that fat makes it easier to regain the fat compared to someone that was always Skinny.

However, in some rare cases, chromosomes may have three or more sister chromatids due to errors in DNA replication or recombination. These are called polytene chromosomes or polytene chromatids. Polytene chromosomes are usually found in certain tissues of some insects, such as the salivary glands of fruit flies. They are thought to be a way of increasing gene expression and protein synthesis in these cells.

443,About how long would it take for an active volcano just above water to form an island (with trees and wildlife/vegetation)?,"The answer will depend a bit on the details, but we can consider a useful natural example from [Surtsey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtsey), an island off Iceland that first emerged from the ocean in 1963 and has been studied for this exact question, i.e., how does life colonize a new volcanic island. The introduction to [Sigurdsson & Magnusson, 2010](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/7/883/2010/bg-7-883-2010.pdf) provides a nice timeline of events. I'll refer interested readers to that paper (and the relevant references), but some highlights to get at a rough chronology:

* 1963 - Island first emerges, eruption continues for 3 years. 
* 1965 - First vascular plant found along the beach, while eruption is ongoing
* 1968 - First moss found
* 1970 - First lichen found
* 1971 - First fungus found
* 1986 - Gulls establish a small breeding colony
* 2003 - Population of gulls is ~300 breeding pairs, vascular plant proliferation grew in tandem with gull population
* 2008 - >60 different species of vascular plants live on the island

The main point of the Sigurdsson & Magnusson paper is the importance of the gulls (and seabirds more broadly) in the vegetation patterns, specifically by the birds providing abundant quantities of a limiting nutrient (nitrogen) that allows plant communities to flourish where the birds live. This echoes other work highlighting the importance of marine birds in vegetation development on islands, from the introduction of nutrients like at Surtsey, but also through seed delivery and dispersal (e.g., [Ellis, 2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-005-7147-y)).

In terms of delivery of other organisms (and to some extent, the original colonizing plants), birds again can play a role, but there are a variety of other mechanisms. As described in a variety of literature (e.g., [Measey et al., 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01589.x), [Garcia-Oliveras et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12961), [Santos et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018221004405) and references therein, etc.) animals and seeds/plants can be delivered to islands by ""normal"" wind dispersal, storm events, rafting (i.e., things floating there on debris, kelp mats, etc), and even by large landslides. The timescales for these processes are going to vary widely (and depend on things like proximity of the island to other, already colonized islands, or large landmasses, among other things), so it's a bit hard to pin down a single characteristic timescale for the colonization by organisms, but suffice to say, it can be pretty short in many cases."
444,Can ancient writing systems be extrapolated by some measure of complexity?,"Not really, TBH. Writing systems don't necessarily change at any particular pace; especially since they're much more under the conscious control of their users than spoken language is. We can infer from the fact that the Chinese script and the Mayan script both are fully-functional linguistic writing systems from the earliest attestations that both were likely preceded by some kind of proto-writing system like the one we can watch Sumerian grow out of, but there's no way to know for sure how long that process was or even much about what it might have looked like. 

That said, I think we can make some decent, if vague, educated guesses. Here's my understanding of what we know about the three-or-four instances of truly independent inventions of writing:

* In the case of Sumerian, we can actually watch it develop out of a mnemonic system used for trade and taxation. The first attestations of this nonlinguistic system are from about 3300 BC, and the first real linguistic elements start appearing about four hundred years later. After that the forms of the letters slowly become more and more abstract, as medium-dependent ease-of-writing considerations start to become more important than the need to make the characters an obvious picture of anything.
* Egyptian is a fully-formed linguistic writing system by about 2600 BC, though there are a few apparent uses of the system several hundred years before, so it's hard to put a clear date on the transition from mnemonics to real linguistic writing. It's not clear if Egyptian is an independent development or inspired by Sumerian; both develop around the same time. Egyptian gets its own schematic / simplified system (Hieratic) not much later than that 2600 BC date, but the system using very obvious pictures continues in use in formal contexts until the system finally stops being used entirely after the the Christianisation of the Roman Empire.
* Chinese writing is only attested from the 1200s BC on discarded divinatory bones, but appears as a full linguistic system with no apparent predecessor nonlinguistic mnemonic system. However, we can infer from the character 冊 ('book, bound volume') that it was almost certainly written on other materials at the same time and before - the character appears in these oracle bone inscriptions, and is apparently a depiction of the kind of bound-bamboo-strip book known to have been used for centuries in China. So odds are it also had the same development process, but all of it happened on perishable material that's all gone now. The oracle bone script's characters are typically much less abstract than later Chinese script forms, suggesting that it possibly hadn't had all that much time to develop into more abstract and easier to write characters - it may have still been fairly new as a full linguistic system by that 1200s BC date.
* Mayan also appears ex nihiló as a fully functional linguistic system in stone inscriptions, potentially as early as the 300s BC. Again, it's entirely likely that it was used on perishable materials well before that - we still have a few Mayan bark-paper codices from later times. A few undeciphered inscriptions in [one or more possible related systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmian_script) have also been found with dates (written on them!) in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, suggesting that the Mayan system or a predecessor had enough use on perishable materials to spawn other systems besides the surviving Mayan one, which were themselves used almost exclusively on perishable materials. Given that even by the 1500s the Mayan script hadn't been particularly simplified for ease of writing, it's nearly impossible to say how long it had developed beforehand.

(Every other script in the world is likely descended from one of these four, if not by adoption-and-adaptation then at least by contact with a literate culture.)

So given that Sumerian took about half a millennium from first attestations to being a significantly linguistic system rather than just a pictographic mnemonic system, we can infer that these other systems probably also had at least a few centuries of use in such ways before their attestations on more durable media."
445,Why is the sky blue? Do I understand it correctly:,"Yes, I believe you're mostly right. This is all described via [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering), which states that the amount of scattering light undergoes is inversely proportional to it's wavelength (actually, to its wavelength to the fourth power, so a very strong connection) (and to answer your last question, yes, you can talk about frequency or wavelength of light. They are bound together by the equation (frequency)\*(wavelength) = (speed of light)). 

So, coming from the sun is white light. The high frequency/small wavelength light (like blue) is more likely to get scattered. Thus, the blue light gets bounced all around, making the whole sky seem blue. 

Since most of the blue light gets scattered, what is remaining is the other colors. At sunrise/sunset, the light from the Sun is passing through more atmosphere, so the longer wavelength light (like red) has more time to scatter"
446,Why do anti inflammatory drugs put autoimmune diseases into remission? Since the Antibodies are still there?,"Antibodies by themselves are not capable of damaging or destroying things. They act as markers that 'paint' a target so that other immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes etc) can phagocytose/attack the offending target e.g. bacteria/fungi/parasites/viruses/virus infected cells. 

In autoimmune conditions, the antibodies mark the host's own cells erroneously, and the other immune cells do the damage.

Immunosuppressant drugs dampen the activity of these immune cells, so while you may still have antibodies marking the host cells, they won't get damaged by the immune system. 

Unfortunately as a side effect, there may not be an effective response mounted against a real invader e.g. microbes"
447,"Is there academic consensus on whether political microtargeting (i.e., political ads that are tailored and targeted to specific groups or individuals) has an effect on people's voting behavior?","I'm a data scientist who worked through large share of research related to increasing voter turnout. There is a host of research on related issues, but let's reframe the question a bit. We might start with ""to what extent does political advertising work"" and then ask whether it's a homogenous effect (it affects everyone more or less the same) or a heterogenous effect (it affects different people differently).

The good news is that voter turnout is a large experimental body and large random controlled trials are performed fairly easily. There have been a wide variety of experiments on different treatment effects showing different results, many of these summarized in the book [Get Out the Vote](https://www.brookings.edu/book/get-out-the-vote-2/). Some of these use deliberate [RCTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) and others use [natural experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment). 

These broadly show that standard GOTV methods are effective, but that their effectiveness is somewhat difficult to measure because it's always against a background of voter propensity. In a population where everyone votes, any turnout method has 0 effectiveness. In a population where many GOTV methods are already being employed, your particular treatment effect will be significantly less effective. In terms of price, a good vote-per-dollar effect will be around 300 dollars a vote. (So now you know what your vote is worth).

For this same reason, a large degree of heterogeneity is expected with respect to propensity. Someone who is already determined to vote cannot be encouraged to vote. Experiments to measure heterogeneity generally show that there is a population of ""discouraged voters"" with very low propensities who cannot be easily encouraged, and most of the efforts to increase voter turnout are for people with estimated propensities between 30% and 70% chance of turnout. 

So we know that microtargeting using conventional methods are fairly effective and that targeting people based on propensity is fairly effective. But is this what microtargeting means? Not usually. Usually it means crafting the message to the individual, perhaps based on their particular psychology. So far, I haven't seen research that supports this kind of messaging is effective. In fact, the most effective messaging seems to be as apolitical as possible. When you orient your message towards politics, it seems to active people's defense mechanisms and a sense that they're being manipulated. I haven't seen evidence of any politically-oriented ads being particularly effective at engaging voters."

It tells you the quality of evidence for calling something carcinogenic. Which means that current evidence supporting hotdogs' carcinogenity is as strong as the evidence for carcinogenity of smoking.

449,Is the energy released in nuclear fission higher when the neutron flux is higher?,"The reaction Q-value (energy released per reaction) doesn't depend on the incident neutron energy. 

However the number of neutrons available and energy spectrum of the neutrons will determine the rate at which fission reactions happen."
450,Why is speed not perceived?,"One thing to always keep in mind- accelerations are perceived, velocities are not. G's is a measure of acceleration (aka, 1 G is the same acceleration that you feel standing on the surface of the Earth, 2Gs is twice that amount). So, going back to your airplane, you feel the accelerations- when the plane is taking off, you're pushed back into your seat, and when it's landing, you are pushed forward. That's because when you take off and land, you're accelerating (going from standstill to 435 mph/going from 435 mph to stand still). Pilots in high-G training do feel it all- they are undergoing high acceleration, not just high speed. 

The reason a lot of people think they feel speed is because normally when you're going fast, you're moving fast compared to your surroundings, and so you are feeling a lot of resistance. For instance, if you're driving in a car, you don't ""feel"" the speed. But if you were to keep driving and open the sunroof and stand up, you would suddenly feel that speed. What's happening? In the car, you're moving at the same speed as your surroundings, so you don't notice. When you stand up out of the sunroof, now you're moving in relation to your surroundings, so you feel all the air (and bugs) hitting you."
451,Would a human at the speed of light collapse into a black hole?,"For some time, in modern physics, people taught the concept of ""relativistic mass"" which is what you're describing- mass increases as you speed up. This method of describing the phenomenon has really fallen out of favor, and most likely precisely because of misunderstandings it caused, for instance, questions like this (this is not meant as an insult to you or your question, but instead, a discussion about how this used to be taught very poorly). 

An easy way to instantly know that this isn't the case- we know speed is relative, and there are no preferred reference frames (that is, you can't say definitively ""I am at rest, and you are moving."" Any inertial (aka, non accelerating) frame is just as good as any other. So, that means, there is a valid frame in which you are moving at 99.999999999% the speed of light, and you are not a black hole, so obviously, moving close to the speed of light doesn't increase your mass to turn you into a black hole. 

So, what is happening? It's much better to think of a relativistic momentum. Day-to-day we say ""momentum is equal to your mass times your velocity."" Under relativity, momentum doesn't follow that equation, instead you can say:

     p = m*v/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2)

Or in words, momentum (p) is equal to your mass times your velocity, divided by this term, the square root of 1 minus your velocity, divided by the speed of light, squared. 

So, a couple of things to notice. One, if your velocity is slow compared to the speed of light, then it essentially returns to the normal m\*v equation. Two, that sqrt term is the same term that is in time dilation and length contraction. Third, and perhaps most important for understanding- that 'v' is the velocity as measured by some observer. The object going at 'v' won't measure his speed as some velocity- the traveler measures his own speed as 0, and instead measures things around him moving. So, this relativistic momentum is the momentum of an object *as measured by an outside observer.* Finally, it is tempting (and kind of intuitive) to say something like:

    p = (m/sqrt(1-v/c)^2))*v

and then call that first term, mass divided by the sqrt term, your ""relativistic mass."" But that gets confusing, for the exact reason that people ask this question. Now, we say your mass is your ""rest mass"" and different observers will measure different momentums for objects, but they will all agree on the mass of the object."
452,"Air in high altitude places has got lower oxygen content. Would there be more oxygen at the bottom of a four-kilometre, dry, mountain-shaped crater?","It's not specifically that there's less oxygen at high altitudes; there's less air in general, including oxygen. A deep crater would have higher-density air overall, meaning more oxygen and more of everything else."
453,How are the increased amount of wildfires we’ve seen over the last couple of years directly related to climate change?,"Lack of rain is part of the issue, but as usual, it's a complex situation with multiple contributing factors.

The first one, at least the one I was aware of the earliest, was the spread of invasive species such as pine beetle, spruce beetle and a few others. When warmer climates allowed them to spread to new areas, they were able to outpace their natural predators and devastate large forested areas.

This was not necessarily a death sentence, but the most affected areas were areas where the forestry industry had razed biodiversity, and re-planted only specific kinds of trees (usually one species in a very large area). This unnatural configuration made them all compete for the same limited nutrients, weakening the top soil and making the trees unhealthy.

Unhealthy trees are an easy target for tree-killing insects. Dead trees are basically kindling. A lack of moisture in the trees, combined with a lack of moisture in the environment, combined with the lack of other vegetation or healthy topsoil providing any sort of safety net, turns what was once a healthy, diverse forest into a Tinderbox.

The danger is amplified as temperatures continue to rise, because the trees get even drier, and the chance of a small spark setting off a massive blaze increases.

I'm sure I've missed some significant factors, as wildfires were a thing before the invasive species showed up, but the increased frequency and severity is at least partially due to what I've outlined above.

Someone with more info will hopefully elaborate further and point out anything I've got wrong, here. :)

Edit: u/link_hiker has raised an interesting study by NASA that found pine beetle kill and wildfire spread are not positively correlated in all cases.

More recent study seems to indicate the type of forest and regional factors can actually make pine beetle kill areas less likely to burn.

However, other data suggests pine beetle kill areas, when they do ignite, burn much faster than healthy trees.

455,How does stress affect the brain's interpretation of what it picks up from the 7 senses?,"Neuroscience Prof checking in. That is a good question, and to my knowledge, does not have a good answer. This is partly because the term stress is not well defined, and is not a unitary thing. A brief stress, like someone jump scaring you, releases a good dose of adrenaline, norepinephrine, and other chemicals that heighten many senses briefly - for instance people are better at visual search in this state. But chronic stress is often associated with inflammation, which appears to dull senses. There are a myriad states of stress in between - from not sleeping for a couple days, being ill, anxiety of some upcoming event, etc. These can affect all sorts of hormones and other signaling molecules to affect the brain."
456,What causes DNA to break down and create genetic mutations spontaneously?,"
Essentially all chemical processes are subject to a certain amount of error and the more complex they are, the more likely that errors will occur.
In the case of DNA errors occur internally due to replication errors and other spontaneous changes, and external causes such as various physical and chemical events.
So, DNA will always be changing, but so would any other molecule that might be used for information storage. In fact any molecule that could eliminate any change would not be  a success as no evolution could take place."

3. that area doesn't typically experience such intense smoke outbreaks."
458,Why are some elements radioactive? What's so special about uranium's composition that makes it so radioactive while hydrogen and carbon generally aren't?,"Too many protons repelling each other for the strong force from the protons and neutrons to keep the nucleus stable. The strong force tapers off at such small distances, that any nucleus bigger than Pb can't stay together, no matter how many neutrons are there to help."
459,"How exactly does ""stability"" work in analytical anion groups from qualitative analysis?",">""Hydrochloric acid is more stable than the acids from which the group anions are derived, so when it reacts with these anions salts, it replaces the less stable acids which are easy to volatilize or decompose in the form of gases which can be detected by suitable reagents""

It's a bad wording. It's just a stronger acid. The anions from group I are weak acids (strong bases), so they are protonated by dilute HCl. The products of protonation are either unstable (HNO2, H2CO3, H2SO3) or volataile and poorly soluble in water (H2S, HCN). In any case, there is some kind of gaseus product. It is later possible to identify the specific product by using a suitable reagent.

> Bonus Question: Why do we use Dilute HCl in one group, but Concentrated H2SO4 in another?

In case of group I, a dilute acid is enough to detect the anions. If you used a concentrated acid, this would cause unspecific reactions with the anions from group II."
460,Is 0’ elevation sea level the same everywhere across the globe?,"When we say ""the same"", we need to ask ""the same relative to what?"" 
 Let's drill down to what sea level is, based on what it *isn't*:

Sea level is not the same distance from the center of the Earth everywhere.  Because the Earth is spinning, it's wider at the equator than the poles by about 22 km.  A spinning ball of uniform material would form a fat 3-d oval shape called an ""oblate spheroid"", not a sphere.

But sea level is not the same everywhere relative to an oblate spheroid, either, because the Earth's composition varies.  Parts of the Earth with mountain ranges or denser rock or ice sheets have more gravitational pull, and pull the ocean towards them.  If the ocean were stagnant it would conform to the shape of a ""gravitational equipotential surface"", a complicated lumpy shape where every spot on the surface has the same gravitational energy.

But sea level is not the same everywhere relative to an equipotential surface either, because the ocean is moving.  It experiences forces from air pressure, winds, pressure and drag from the seafloor and coastlines, and all of these change its height relative to the geopotential.

So the only thing sea level is constant with respect to is itself.  It varies geographically for lots of reasons, and it varies over *time* too, on timescales ranging from seconds to billions of years."
461,Why does northern Greenland have a tundra climate?,"The Gulf Stream and polar days. The Gulf Stream moves a steady underwater current of warm water upwards, the thermal mass of which constantly releases heat into the local Greenland environment and raising the average temperature. The more inland you are from the ocean, the colder it gets.

As the sun does not set during the polar days of summer, the extra energy from the sun warms the Arctic (and Greenland), causing melt. It is possible to go as long as five months of constant sun in the northern most parts of Greenland. This melt has been accelerated due to climate change. The Arctic summer melt is normal but the melt has accelerated in recent years. The additional melt has resulted in significant habitat loss for polar bears as they can no longer range for as far or as long and must swim more than they used to."
462,Do animals mate in their age range?,"Different animals have different mating systems, which are the ways they choose their mates and reproduce. 

Some factors that affect mating systems are **genetic diversity**, **environmental stability**, **parasite resistance**, **parental investment**, **sexual maturity** and **reproductive success**.

Some animals mate with partners of similar age, while others do not seem to care about age difference. 
This may depend on how long they live, how fast they grow, how much they invest in their offspring, and how much competition they face for mates.

For example, rodents like lemmings can reach sexual maturity in 1-2 months, and they may not live very long. They can mate with partners of any age as long as they are fertile. Dogs and bovids (like cows and sheep) take about a year to reach maturity, and they may mate with older or younger partners depending on their availability and attractiveness. Whales take much longer to mature, and they may prefer mates of similar age because they have more experience and social bonds.

Some animals have monogamous mating systems, where they form long-term bonds with one partner. This may happen when both parents are needed to raise the offspring, or when mates are scarce. 

Monogamous animals may mate with partners of similar age because they have more compatibility and cooperation. 
Some examples of monogamous animals are wolves, beavers, gibbons and albatrosses.

Other animals have polygamous mating systems, where they mate with multiple partners. This may happen when one parent can raise the offspring alone, or when mates are abundant. 

Polygamous animals may mate with partners of different ages depending on their quality and availability. Some examples of polygamous animals are lions, gorillas, deer and peacocks.

However, bats do not get sick from these viruses because they have a special immune system that makes less interferons and inflammation than humans and mice. This means they can tolerate the viruses without getting hurt by them. 

Bats also have some unique genes that help them limit inflammation. These genes are only found in bats and not in other mammals.

464,How is the expansion rate of the universe derived from the CMB?,"In general relativity, there are a set of equations called the FLRW metric. This describes how the universe would expand if it were a uniform soup at cosmological scales. However, it is not specific to what kind of soup the universe is; so you can apply FLRW if the universe is entirely made of matter, or entirely made of radiation, or entirely made of dark matter, or some combination thereof. The 'discovery' of dark energy came when we realized that none of our observations matched any of our FLRW calculations unless we assumed that the universe had a significant amount of dark energy.

When we observe the CMB, we notice that it is very very smooth, but there are some rough spots. We call that the CMB anisotropy. The size and properties of the roughness are themselves affected by the make-up of the universe. We can use FLRW and play around with the parameters until we get a model universe where the roughness of the CMB is consistent with what we observe. We then use those parameters to calculate what the Hubble constant should be today.

If you want an analogy, observing galaxies is like watching a car race and measuring its lap time. Observing the CMB lets us examine the engine etc. in enough detail that we should be able to calculate the cars lap time."
465,How closely related are Onions and Garlic (genetically)?,"Both onions and garlic are species of the same genus, *Allium*. But this isn’t quite the same as, say, *Homo neanderthalensis* and *Homo sapiens* both being members of the genus *Homo*…*Allium* as a genus is [roughly 40 million years old](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7262478/), and contains more than 800 species. 

But within *Allium* there are three separate major evolutionary lineages, and both garlic and onions belong to the third lineage, which split from the second lineage closer to 20 million years ago. And from figure 3B in the above-linked paper, we can see that the ancestor of modern garlic (*Allium sativum*) and the ancestor of the different modern onion species (the branch containing *Allium cepa*) separated roughly 9 million years ago. That’s in the ballpark of when the hominini (humans and chimps) split from the ancestors of gorillas…so garlic and onions are pretty closely related indeed!"

Radioactive iodine collects in the thyroid and causes cancer there.

Skin cancer's a very real thing, since it gets exposed first.

471,How does nerve growth and neurofibromatosis work?,"Schwann cells are the cells that are responsible for supporting your nerves in the peripheral nervous system. They're best known for insulating nerves by wrapping them in myelin, a combination of proteins and lipids; however, some Schwann cells just provide support and do not insulate nerves. These are called non-myelinating Schwann cells or Remak Schwann cells (named after the guy who discovered them). These are the cells that overgrow in Neurofibromatosis and form the tumors you can see on the skin. Since these cells normally support the nerves by secreting a variety of factors, when they overgrow they secrete even more of these factors which cause the surrounding cells to also proliferate including skin cells, blood vessel cells, immune cells etc. As these tumors grow, nerve endings will also tend to grow with them like in regular skin. 

Growing nerves will generally not merge into each other. Different nerves detect different signals (eg light touch, pressure, pain, temperature, etc) so merging nerves would eliminate our ability to discriminate between different stimuli. However, we have been able to graft damaged nerves together. This is one way people are looking to help people with spinal cord injuries regain feeling and control over their limbs.

476,Newtons laws regarding space walks?,"> And gravity is still present even at the ISS. Satellites use fuel to stay in orbit (yet the moon seemingly orbits earth in a way where gravity is not pulling it closer essentially in a perfect way which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years)

While the Earth's gravity certainly affects the ISS and our satellites, the fact that ISS (and the satellites) are moving so fast means that they're in a constant state of free fall. They're being pulled towards the Earth by gravity, but they move so quickly perpendicular to the Earth's surface that they're essentially ""falling over the horizon"". Astronauts on board ISS experience weightlessness not because they're in a ""zero-gravity"" environment, but because they're in a constant free fall.

But ISS and satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) are not that far out in space. ISS orbits only 400 km above the surface and many satellites are at similar altitudes. At these altitudes, there is still some atmosphere left. It's extremely thin, but it's there and it has a measurable effect on satellites as the atmosphere creates a drag force that slows satellites down. If left uncorrected, this will cause satellites to gradually lose altitude and eventually crash or burn up in the denser atmosphere closer to the surface.

That's why these satellites have thrusters that they have to use. Every now and then, they need to burn some fuel to get a nudge and restore their orbit. But this need is solely due to the presence of trace amounts of air. If there was no air, an orbiting object wouldn't need these corrections. And that's why the Moon doesn't need thrusters as it's far enough away that there's no air left to slow it down. Just for a sense of perspective: At the furthest point in its orbit, the Moon is about a 1000x further from the Earth than ISS is.

Coming back to the space walks:

>  so how is a human on a spacewalk not being dragged by their tether and instead it looks as if they move with it. Or is the force of the spaceship canceling out gravity what keeps the human moving at a constant rate seemingly locked in place?

The astronaut on a space walk is in free fall just like the space station. That means that there's no (significant) net force pulling the astronaut in any specific direction if the astronaut is just floating there. The same air resistance that slows down the ISS and requires periodic boosting also affects the astronaut, but this effect is so small that it's irrelevant and unnoticeable in the time frame of a space walk."

479,"How does glass protect me from UV, but being underwater does nothing?","Water and glass are both largely transparent in visible wavelengths, but outside of visible wavelengths they aren't the same. They are totally different in terms of chemistry and physical state, so they block or transmit different wavelengths. Each has a *transmission* spectrum (or, if you want to think of it the opposite way, an *absorption* spectrum), that describes how much light it lets through at each wavelength.

Ultraviolet light is only just beyond the visible spectrum, just a little bit shorter in wavelength than violet. Both glass and water have a ""window"" in the in spectrum around visible light (about 380-750 nanometres), but this window doesn't cut off exactly where the human eye stops being able to see the light. Because ultraviolet is right on the edge of the visible spectrum, a little bit of change in the ""size"" of this window makes a big difference.

[Here](https://www.mdpi.com/fibers/fibers-07-00073/article_deploy/html/images/fibers-07-00073-g001.png) is a graph showing transmission for a few different types of glass. You can see the transmission dramatically drops from 400 nm down to 300 nm.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_absorption_by_water#/media/File:Absorption_spectrum_of_liquid_water.png) is a graph showing absorption for liquid water. You can see the absorption dramatically drops at 200 nm instead.

So around 350-200 nm, there's a bunch of ultraviolet light that can push through water, but would be absorbed by glass.

Additionally, a lot of dangerous radiation is not electromagnetic radiation - it's particles, like beta radiation (electrons), alpha radiation (helium nuclei - two protons plus two neutrons), or even just protons (the solar wind has a lot of protons in it). These will collide with almost any atoms, so it's just a matter of having a lot of atoms around you. Water is useful here just because it's dense - 800 times denser than air - and cheap and convenient. If you put a reactor in a swimming pool 20 metres deep, that's a very practical way to get tonnes and tonnes of material between you and the radiation source. Concrete would work too, just in terms of blocking radiation, but you can't pump that in and out for cleaning etc.

On top of that, the most dangerous electromagnetic radiation from nuclear reactions is gamma rays, not ultraviolet. Gamma rays have an extremely short wavelength, and again it's mostly a matter of having lots of *stuff* between you and the radiation source to make sure you block it, and that's where water is useful."

481,Would a Dyson sphere not immediately cool whatever solar system it’s in to uninhabitable levels from blocking sunlight?,"So, you are stretching ""realistic"" physics a bit to build a Dyson sphere in the first place - it might take more material than is actually available in the Solar System, and even then a solid shell would require some science fiction materials and be gravitationally unstable. A swarm of small stations whose orbits completely completely cover the star is a bit more realistic. But regardless, any question on Dyson spheres is going to be limited in scope if it's not touching more on science fiction than actual science.

But if we do apply realistic physics, it turns out that a Dyson sphere (whatever form it takes) must emit just as much light as the star itself did. By conservation of energy, if the Dyson sphere is absorbing more energy than it is emitting, then it is heating up, and it can't just heat up forever.

What happens here is that the ""outside"" of the Dyson sphere will emit energy in the form of infrared radiation, and this will have exactly the same luminosity as the star it surrounds. Power plants don't ""use"" energy, they convert it from a ""more useful"" low-entropy form into a ""less useful"" high-entropy form, doing ""work"" along the way.

Here, distant objects orbiting the Dyson sphere may still be warmed quite a bit by this warm low frequency radiation. Objects will not be heated as much as they would be by the ""hot"" radiation of the star, particularly nearby objects, as the Dyson sphere's radiation is emitted from a larger area than the star's radiation, but it won't be nearly as bad as having zero radiation from the object."
482,What is the difference between a multi vortex tornado and a tornado family?,"A **multi-vortex tornado** is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axes and at the same time revolve around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These are often encompassed within the parent circulation of a tornado, and aren’t visible.

A **tornado family** is a series of tornadoes produced by the same storm cell. These tornadoes may occur at the same time or in succession. A tornado family is different from a cyclically tornadic supercell, which is a storm that produces multiple tornadoes over a longer period of time with breaks in between.

So a multi-vortex tornado is one tornado with multiple spinning columns inside it, while a tornado family is multiple tornadoes from the same storm."
483,What happens to the previously submerged land when a dam is broken or decommissioned?,"There's been a fair bit of research on this topic in the last decade or so as dam removal, especially in the US, has been en vogue during this time period. What we've observed in these scenarios suggest that the river system typically removes (via erosion) most of the impounded sediment relatively quickly, i.e., in a few months to years (e.g., [Foley et al., 2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017WR020457), [Tsutsumi & Laronne, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118971437.ch13)). As discussed in these reviews, the response speed depends on a few factors though, like the size (in the sense of discharge) of the river, the ""head"" of the dam (i.e., what's the height difference between the top of the reservoir and the height of the water downstream of the dam), the sediment caliber (i.e., grain size), and the rapidity of dam removal itself. If dams are removed more gradually, the response tends to be more gradual (e.g., [Burroughs et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X09001275)) and similarly, if dams are removed on relatively small or low flow rivers and/or a dam with low head, the response is slow (e.g., [Cheng & Granata, 2007](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005WR004271)). The removal of the Ukranian dam happened on a relatively large river, on a relatively large dam, and happened quickly, so barring significant barriers to rapid response from the type of sediment in the river or other factors, if the process was allowed to complete, we'd generally expect for the upstream sediment deposited behind the reservoir to be evacuated in the coming months to years and the landscape upstream to return to something broadly similar to the pre-dam state.

One relevant bit about dam removal (planned or unplanned), is that beyond the obvious flood risks downstream that come from the unplanned variety, there have long been concerns about the distribution of the formerly impounded sediments downstream. This is because very often these end up having a relatively high concentration of various contaminants, reflecting sequestration and concentration over time behind the dam of varieties of compounds and elements that are transported in low concentration within the sediment load or water column, but accumulated over time behind the dam. For example, this paper from [Evans & Gottgens, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0380133007701363) considers the ""contaminant stratigraphy"" of the deposit behind a particular dam that was being considered for removal. In detail, many studies of contaminants after dam removal don't find huge fluxes of these contaminants following removal (e.g., [Ashley et al., 2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-006-4781-3), [Cantwell et al., 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-014-3742-5)), but a lot depends on the nature of dam removal and the exact contaminant load within the sequestered sediments."
484,"In serology, is IgM testing specific for a specific pathogen?","The answer is…yes?

You can test for IgM (or IgG or IgA) levels in a patient without regard to specificity, though this is usually done for purposes of diagnosing immune system irregularities (e. g. Multiple myeloma, immune deficiencies, etc.)

But for many major diseases of public health concern, you can also test for IgM specific antibodies. That’s kind of the bread and butter if the whole field of serology. There are IgM-specific tests for the viral hepatitises, measles, rabies, and yes, even malaria and dengue. Many are qualitative while some, specifically hep A and hep B, rely on quantitative interpretations to distinguish vaccination from current or previous infections."

486,Do coral polyps share a nervous system?,"Coral polyps and siphonophores are both types of cnidarians, which are animals with stinging cells and a simple nervous system called a **nerve net**. 

A nerve net is a network of nerve cells that can sense and react to stimuli, but does not have a central brain or specialized organs.

**Coral polyps** are the individual units that make up a coral colony. They are connected by a thin layer of tissue that allows them to share nutrients and signals. 

The nervous system is continuous between the individual polyps, and they can respond to electrical stimulation by contracting their tentacles or body. 

Corals can also detect certain substances such as sugars and amino acids, which help them find food. 

However, corals cannot feel pain because their nerve net cannot process as much information as ours.

**Siphonophores** are also colonial organisms, but they are composed of different types of zooids that have specialized functions such as feeding, swimming, reproducing or bioluminescing. 

Each zooid has its own nerve net, but they are also connected by nerves in the stem-like structure that links the different parts of the colony together. This allows them to coordinate their movements and behaviors. 

For example, some siphonophores can swim backwards or forwards by contracting their bell-shaped nectophores, which are zooids that act like jet engines. 

The nectophores have a ring-shaped nervous system that receives an input from the rest of the colony via the lower nerve tract, and also has an upper nerve tract that appears to have a sensory role.

Tldr: Coral polyps and siphonophores both have a simple nervous system called a nerve net, but they differ in how they are organized and connected. Coral polyps are similar units that form a colony, while siphonophores are different units that form a superorganism. Both can sense and react to stimuli, but neither can feel pain.

487,How do aquatic mammals deal with changing pressure on their ears?,"The reason it's a problem in humans is that we have small, collapsible eustachian tubes (the tubes that connect your inner ear to your mouth/atmosphere). 

Fish don't have the same kind of inner ear chamber that we do, so it's not an issue. 

Mammals like whales have, among other things, big, rigid eustachian valves so they don't have to ""pop"" them. 

The short version is that the human anatomy that makes it a problem doesn't quite exist in there animals."
488,What role does vasopressin play in parental behaviour in humans?,"It’s not exactly wrong to think about it in terms of “X chemical causes Y behavior”, but it leads you down a conceptual path that excludes the concepts of balancing and cooperation that is critical in all things neurobehavioral, certainly among animals and even more so in humans. A similar misconception has unfortunately remained ubiquitous regarding testosterone, particularly in men. Testosterone really cannot be directly linked to particular behaviors (though disruptions in synthesis or SHBG expression can certainly suppress some realms of behavior), but rather to the abstract landscape that these behaviors travel through as we express them. As Sapolsky likes to half-humorously say, if you picked out the Buddhist monk with the most testosterone, he’s not going to be the horniest and most debaucherous monk, but rather the most selfless and ascetic one in the bunch, or at least the one striving for those most potently. In other words, the androgens (in the context of neurobiology, so including DHT and aldosterone) generally intensify and provide direction for existing behaviors generated from other perceptive and neurobiological sources.

Oxytocin and vasopressin combine in a variety of contexts to produce a very wide range of social behavior in humans, and often the same mixture will produce different impulses based on the perceived environment, one classical example being similar OTR activation trends in maternal bonding and sexual behavior, but with very different (stronger) contribution from prolactin in the former, and very little in the latter. Vasopressin will also cooperate with oxytocin at the vasopressin receptor V1ar, and the dynamics of this cooperation are heavily contextualize by perception. So, it’s more holistic to say that certain cooperative patterns of vaso and oxy underly the specific behavior seen in mothers (and fathers!) during infant bonding, rather than to try and force vasopressin into a one-dimensional knob that increases and decreases some behavior, and you’ll find this is true of most pathways in neurobiology.

Sue Carter at the Kinsey Institute would be the go-to for more reading on this topic. The neurobiology of oxy and vaso in the context of familial bonding is basically her field.

Also remember that humans are animals too. To quote Sapolsky again, human neurobiology can basically be summed up as grabbing stuff off the shelves of the mammalian neurobiology Home Depot and innovating new and more complex ways to use them as tools for socializing, and certainly vasopressin is a great example of this.

491,Is happiness correlated with creativity?,"Anecdotally, accessing creativity is more about focus than mood. The presence of rumination (I’m a bad artist, people are depending on me and I’m letting them down, etc…) are a distraction from engaging with problem solving and the more focused you are on CONCERNS about your work the less you’re actually connecting with your work.

Most artists don’t understand that this is usually the source of “writers block.”

You can be happy, depressed, morose, tired, energetic, in love, etc… And still access creativity if you have good tools for reframing concerns to relieve internal pressure and expenditure on coping, that surplus energy will increase your creativity since creativity is often about making interesting lateral connections as part of the context of the work. More layers of associations and meaning you can build into the work, the more “creative” it is. That requires a lot of energy and focus.

Outside that there will be a wide variance in temperament and personality that skews this and also requires different strategies person to person. But fundamentally… if you’re worrying about life or social safety, these are all barriers to living inside the work instead of living inside your head.

492,How is it possible for a particular coastal area to flood when other coastal areas of the same ocean don’t?,"The elevation of coastal formations are not uniform throughout the world so it stands to reason that even without things like water currents or the tide, some coasts may be lower in elevation and more prone to flooding while higher ones are not. Furthermore, natural barriers such as mangrove trees would weaken waves and help protect the coast from things like erosion, storms, and tsunamis."
493,Can teeth really get regrown with stem cells?,"There's more than one problem to solve for this to be a viable treatment. The problem is not only 'Can we regrow teeth from stem cells?', we already know that that might be possible. But how do we get the tooth bud safely and predictably in just the right spot so that the tooth grows in straight and functional and not crooked? What if there's not enough bone in the site were we want to regrow the tooth? How long will it eventually take from tooth loss to fully regrown tooth? How expensive is this going to be? How will the tooth look, will it need a crown right away to function properly and blend in esthetically with the other teeth?

I think we might be able to see the first regrown human tooth in the next 10-15 years. But it won't be viable in a clinical setting for a long, long time, and even then it will be a super high-end treatment option and not easily accessible for anyone. Right now, an implant (which is the gold standard treatment for lost teeth) will cost you about 3000-5000 USD, it will take about 3-6 months from start to finish and by now it's a very predictable and proven treatment option. An implant however is not a perfect replacement of a natural tooth, it comes with its own risks and disadvantages, but it's the best we have right now. Surely, a regrown tooth would be better than an implant in some regards but it would have to outperform implants in more than one category to become the new gold standard. They would be prohibitively expensive, they would only be available in very specialized clinics (as opposed to implants which are placed in many regular dental offices across the globe) and it'll probably take longer too. So don't expect any miracles soon."
494,How are insulin receptors/signalling damaged?,"Part of the reason it's hard to find is that it isn't well understood, and also because it's an extremely complex process that can break down in many different ways. [Here's an interesting article studying this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941218/). What seems to be a major cause of this isn't the receptor binding itself, but several ways in which the signaling can be interrupted. For instance, free fatty acids can lead to an increase in certain kinases, which can prevent/reduce the phosphorylation of molecules involved in the signaling process. There are many other ways it can be interrupted as well."
495,Does the air inside the tires rotate or not ?,"As the tire changes rotational speed, the air will start out by keeping its rotational speed.

But it is a lot messier than just the whole volume of air rotating. There will be lots of turbulence inside, especially when the tire changes speed."
496,Did Removing Sulfur Dioxide Emissions inadvertently increase the greenhouse effect?,"Sort of, but it's a bit more complicated. 

To start, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere does lead to reflection of some portions of incoming solar radiation, so elevated concentrations of it (and certain other particulates) in the atmosphere can lead to reduction in temperatures. This is actually also the main mechanism by which very large volcanic eruptions can lead to temporary global cooling episodes, i.e., sulfur dioxide injection into the upper atmosphere (e.g., [Robock, 2000](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1998rg000054)), though in this case the details of volcanic eruptions matter *a lot* in terms of whether this leads to cooling (e.g., consider the discussion in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/volcanic_eruption_climate_change/)).

Returning to the question at hand, anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide can cause these same cooling effects, where again, the magnitude and details of the emissions matter with respect to the outcomes. This property of sulfur dioxide was recognized at the time of implementation of things like the Clean Air Act and is actually also the origin of a persistent ""denier"" talking point, i.e., ""Scientists predicted we were heading into global cooling in the 1970s, why should we believe them now?"" As explained in this [other FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/ice_age_1970s/), this has a nugget of truth in that there were papers at the time projecting that if our SO2 emissions continued to increase as they were at the time, this could lead to global cooling (e.g., [Rasool & Schneider, 1971](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.173.3992.138)), but as very clearly laid out by [Petersen, 2008](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/89/9/2008bams2370_1.xml), even at this point in time, the consensus was that increasing CO2 emissions would swamp this signal and lead to global warming.

And there in lies the complication with respect to the question, i.e., we're pumping *a lot* of different things into the atmosphere all that have different impacts on the temperature (and other properties) of our atmosphere, and often on different timescales. The complications can be seen very clearly with respect to another frequently asked question over the last ~3 years, i.e., ""Did the covid lockdowns influence climate change?"" As discussed in [yet another FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/covid_lockdown_global_warming/), this is not a straightforward question to answer because we're not talking about just reducing CO2 emissions (which have a warming effect over a long time), but also emissions of things like NOx (warming over a short time) and SO2 (cooling over a short time), etc. When we're considering the net climate effect of our emissions, we have to factor in both the positive (in the sense of increasing temperature, not positive in a beneficial sense) and negative inputs to try to deduce the net result.

As highlighted in the lockdown example, SO2 and CO2 (specifically) are also operating on very different timescales. CO2 is (all things considered) a relatively weak greenhouse gas, but has effectively a long residence time so a given unit of CO2 produces warming for a long time. In contrast the cooling effect of SO2 is short lived since the residence time in the atmosphere is short. This means that us reducing our SO2 emissions had a relatively quick effect whereas the warming we're experiencing now effectively represents the impact of CO2 emissions from decades prior (and the CO2 we're emitting now, assures continued warming for decades to centuries into the future in the absence of active removal).

**So in summary**, if we're pumping out CO2 and SO2 into the atmosphere, these are broadly working in opposite directions in terms of their influence on temperature, so whatever climate effect we see reflects the sum, e.g., if our CO2 emissions reflect a +1C / decade warming, but our SO2 emissions reflect a -0.5C / decade cooling, then the observed warming would be +0.5C / decade (in a *super* simplified sense). Thus, if we reduce our SO2 emissions, but don't reduce (or rather continue to increase, as we did) our CO2 emissions, then we would expect the rate of warming to increase because SO2 is no longer masking some portion of the warming driven by CO2, but we have to also consider the time lag between the rapidity of the impacts of these different compounds. While it's a bit of a semantic argument, that's probably the better way to frame the point, i.e., it's not that SO2 emissions reduction ""boosted"" the greenhouse effect so much, but rather it reduced some portion of a cooling effect that was superimposed on the warming effect (which had generally always been larger anyway). Arguably, the other negative externalities of large SO2 emissions (e.g., acid rain) outweighed the potential cooling benefit, but this gets into a lot of hypotheticals (e.g., how would SO2 emissions have scaled with CO2 emissions in the absence of the CAA and similar measures?) and value judgements (e.g., what's worse, acid rain or more warming? neither are good...)."

You could get same frenzy from other fish, but throwing a loaf of bread into their tank.

502,"If the Earth exists long enough, could all of the crust be recycled?","A lot of the major points here are covered in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/crust_recycling/), but the highlights are that the behavior of the two types of crust and lithosphere, i.e., oceanic vs continental, are fundamentally different. Mean residence time for oceanic lithosphere is (geologically) short, somewhere around 200-300 million years. In contrast, continental lithosphere has significantly longer residence times and we don't think about it recycling completely in the same way. As discussed in the FAQ, there are mechanisms by which both new continental crust/lithosphere is generated and portions of continental crust are recycled back into the mantle, but in the context of the question, the important aspect is *where* this happening. 

Specifically, both new continental crust formation and continental crust removal preferentially happen along and near the edges of tectonic plates. The large [cratonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton) interiors of continental portions of plates are broadly considered to have reached a thickness/temperature/composition that is relatively stable in the sense that there are not processes we would expect to significantly alter them at this point. While the basement of these cratonic sections predate much of the history of life, sediments deposited ontop of them (inlcuding those that would record at least some history of multicellular life on Earth) are also more likely to remain ""unrecycled"". 

To fully answer the question though requires a fair bit of speculation, i.e., effectively, is there a possibility that all extant cratons could be completely recycled back into the mantle? With some big caveats, there's not really a compelling reason to think that at this point, assuming tectonics continues to work broadly in the same way, that all cratons could be destroyed. Now, there are mechanisms where cratonic sections of lithosphere can be converted to something more like normal continental crust (e.g., [Liu et al., 2018a](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JB015372)), but even in the cases where this has appeared to happen, (1) it's limited to small sections of cratonic lithopshere and (2) it's not as though the remaining portions of continental lithopshere that use to be the craton are completely recycled, and in fact most of the changes reflect things happening to the mantle portion of the craton, not the crustal portion (e.g., [Liu et al., 2018b](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JB015374))."
503,Why do you need damp sand to build a sandcastle?,"Because it forms bridges between the grains that make it stick together.

The optimal dampness depends on the type of sand and how tightly it is packed:

 - fine sand can hold more water than coarse sand, but it also tends to be more slippery and less stable

 - coarse sand can drain water more quickly, but it also leaves more gaps between the grains that make it weaker

A good way to test the dampness of the sand is to squeeze a handful of it and see if it holds its shape or falls apart."
504,"Why can't humans bioaccumulate heavy metals, such as mercury, in the same way sharks can?",">Those predatory fish, especially sharks, don't suffer from mercury poisoning despite their high mercury consumption.  
>  
>I know our biology isn't the same as fish

Bang on the money, mercury doesn't poison fish, especially sharks, the way it does humans. It's speculated that sharks have a mechanism that protects them from mercury and other toxins but we just don't know

>the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years

There wasn't as much mercury in the sea until humans started emitting it on an industrial scale. there are other toxins that weren't even present until humans started putting them in the environment.

>but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish?

Predatory fish have been living with volcanic mercury build up forever, humans have a more limited exposure.  These days the fish born without sufficient resistance probably all die young, but fish are mostly r reproducers, if toxins kill of some of their spawn it just means better odds of survival for the rest.  I guess if we continue to poison our environment to the point it kills everyone without resistance before they reproduce we will develop our own resistance or go extinct.

Mercury and a few other toxins found in fish are accumulation poisons.  You generally build up a tolerance to poisons by Mithridatism, surviving non-lethal doses, slowly increasing the amount over time until you can survive lethal doses.  This generally only works with complex biological poisons the immune system can respond to.  It absolutely cannot work with an accumulation poisons as non-lethal doses will just stay in your body and eventually build up to a lethal dose."
505,Do Cancerous tumors have an immune system? Do they use our immune system? How do they survive viral or bacterial infections?,"Yes and no. The immune system will actually try to destroy cancer if it can, so one of the first ways a tumor can actually grow and not be eliminated is by co-opting parts of the immune system to work for it. There are certain macrophages called Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) that actually aid in tumor growth and metastasis by removing debris, promoting angiogenesis, and encouraging the growth and repair of tissues. Tumors also tend to be associated with a fairly large number of Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) that are responsible for suppressing any immune response that might otherwise be trying to destroy the tumor. These are part of the tumor microenvironment that's essential for the tumor to grow and propagate, but they don't exactly qualify as an immune system for the tumor itself.

As for how tumors survive infections, that depends too. Macrophages are pretty good at eating bacteria, so having a lot of TAMs hanging around will probably keep low-level infection at bay. At the same time, one type of immunotherapy used to treat cancer is to use certain types of oncolytic viruses and bacteria to either directly kill cancer cells, get the immune system's attention so it will go in and kill the cancer cells, or both. If an infection of some kind gets into the tumor, there's a chance the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment will clear it out and there's also a chance that it will cause a cascade that leads to the tumor's destruction. It really comes down to the type and location of the cancer. The word ""cancer"" is just a catch-all for any one of hundreds of very different malignantly mutated cell diseases which may have very little in common with each other, so any questions about how they work or respond to various factors will have multiple answers."
506,Is Conway's Game of Life Conscious According to Integrated Information Theory?,"probably?

[the theory attributes consciousness to a self-connected lattice network] (https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/12/1160), and GoL is basically just a grid network with very nonlinear activation rules.

a while back, i actually set up a game of life network to analyze with a version of the [IIT 3.0 code] (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588) like what's in the lattice paper above, such a network will certainly be composed of a huge number of causal mechanisms, which implies that the system would have a reasonable amount of overall integrated information. the newer versions of the theory would find the same thing.

the open question is *how much* of the grid would be conscious according to IIT - my hunch is probably it would condense into lots of connected but separate entities.

508,why is gold so non-reactive despite not having full set of electrons in its outer electron shell like noble gases?,"The full outer shell rule as a predictor of reactivity is only really a rule of thumb for lighter elements.

Molecular orbital (MO) theory is a more thorough predictor of reactivity. Within MO theory framework, for a bond to form electrons need to be occupying bonding orbitals over anti-bonding orbitals. The more electrons in bonding orbitals the stronger the bond.

Electrons in metals form delocalised bands (continuum of states) with a defined Fermi energy. States below the Fermi energy are occupied. So if a reacting molecule forms combined orbitals with the metal bands, and these molecule + band states are below the Fermi energy, they are occupied.

Due to electron shielding as one moves across a period and electronic relativistic effects, the bands in gold are fairly low in energy below the Fermi energy. This causes the resultant anti-bonding orbitals formed with reacting molecules to be below the Fermi energy and thus occupied. This leads to weak or no bonding.

510,Why is it that physical exercise is inflammatory in the short term but has a net anti inflammatory effect in the long term?,"Our body has mechanisms to not only induce and amplify inflammatory responses when necessary but also to turn off the response when is no longer required. The inflammation that happen because of physical exercise is a different type of stimulus than an inflammatory response to a pathogen or tissue damage. Just as an example interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a common pro-inflammatory cytokines. After infections IL-6 is produced by activation of the transcription factor NF-kB which at the same time induces the expression of a number of other inflammatory mediators. Exercise induces IL-6 with a mechanism involving activation of the c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK). The release of IL-6 after exercise also results in the production of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonists which are anti-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol which also reduces the inflammatory response ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0177-9#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20may%20thus%20be,%2Dmorbidity%2C%20of%20old%20age.))
The reason why the same cytokine exerts these very different effects as far as I know is still not completely clear. It is likely due to the specific type of inflammatory mediators that are produced along with IL-6 and also it probably depends on the duration of the stimulus since it's known that even the same inflammatory cue can have different results in an acute or in a chronic setting."
511,Does the Astronauts in the ISS affect the orbit by moving around inside?,"The ship itself would move to counteract the change. People move 2 feet left, ship moves 0.0001 feet right (actual value based on the proportional difference in mass.

So, overall, the [orbiting mass] does not change orbit, even if the position of some little bits within that mass shift around. At least, in this case."
512,Are Kahnemann's 2 systems and Acceptance & Commitment Therapy linked?,"Kind of yeah.
The concept of automatic thoughts is prevalent through a lot of CBTs. 
Cognitive Processing Therapy calls them [""stuck points""](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/cognitive-processing-therapy); cognitive therapy calls them [""automatic thoughts""](https://dictionary.apa.org/automatic-thoughts); some therapies refer to them as [""cognitive distortions""](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-recognize-and-tame-your-cognitive-distortions-202205042738).  The idea is that our brains get stuck in habitual ways of responding/thinking, which is typically a helpful System 1 (fast) approach that has been applied too broadly or generally and what helps is activating System 2 in response to that thought. You see techniques like [mindfulness](https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness), challenging beliefs, etc. commonly throughout CBTs as a way to force System 2 on to help to become effective in the face of those."
513,Why are we bad at fighting cancer?,"Our immune mechanisms are unbelievably efficacious when it comes to killing cancerous cells. We are very, very good at fighting cancer. What kills us is simple statistics.

The average human body has about 37 trillion cells. It takes about 80 days for your body to kill and regrow an amount of cells equal to this number. That means that each day a human body kills and replenishes about 400 billion cells. 

Even if one in a hundred million of these was a mutant capable of turning to cancer (which is a number I just plucked from thin air for purpose.of visualization, rather than for scientific accuracy), that would mean your body kills 4000 potential cancer progenitors a day. That would be almost 1.5 million a year.

The sheer scale of what the immune system is capable of is immense. And for that reason, even with an almost perfect system, an error is bound to happen at some point.

The issue we have at our hands once one slips through though is a vicious one: your immune cells are trained to not overly attack your own cells to prevent autoimmunity. The issue is, that cancer cells are still your cells. And once a cancer cell acquires enough mutations to hide, stay alive, disregard death signals and multiply without regard for tissue integrity, you have an issue. Your body is doing what it can but cancer evades the processes your body has for control of damage and intrusion-control

Edit: according to NIH [link](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age) the average age of a cancer diagnosis is 66. If I make it an even 60 to compensate for smaller cell counts in early development, your body will have gone through a grand total of about 11.680.000.000.000.000 cells until one eventually will have become aberrant and developed cancer. This error rate is unfathomably low and visualizes a shred of the immense capability of an organism to defend itself against potentially threatening cells and it's ability to regenerate."
514,"There is currently a ""Strawberry"" or ""Honey"" Moon in Michigan and it is appearing quite red and orange. Is this a result of Rayleigh Scattering like during an eclipse or is there a different reason?",There were pretty decently sized wildfires near [Grayling](https://www.9and10news.com/2023/06/03/michigan-dnr-multiple-counties-battling-100-acre-fire-in-grayling-evacuations-underway/) and the smoke plume itself could even be seen on radar. You are correct in that Rayleigh scattering is the main cause but the extra color is due to the amount of smoke particles in the sky over much of Michigan.
515,Are there plants with photosynthesising pigments other than chlorophyll?,"My understanding is that all terrestrial plants most likely evolved from green algae, which also uses chlorophylls a and c for photosynthesis. All other marine photosynthetic multicellular primary producers use a host of brown, red, blue and blue-green pigments for photosynthesis (fucoxanthin, carotenoids, phycocyanin, phycobilins, etc). I think it would be more accurate to say that chlorophyll pigments evolved from other, more primitive pigments found in older multicellular primary producers (rhodophyta, phaeophyta, chlorophyta).

516,How do borate ions and boric acid lower sound absorption in the ocean?,"The answer is related to the chemical reactions that occur when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater and lowers its pH. 

One of the effects of ocean acidification is that it reduces the concentration of borate ions [B(OH)4-] in seawater, which are responsible for absorbing low-frequency sound waves. 

When sound waves pass through water, they exert pressure that ""squeezes"" borate ions into boric acid [B(OH)3], a more compact molecule. 

In the process, the molecules absorb energy from the sound waves and reduce their intensity. This is why borate ions and boric acid lower sound absorption in the ocean. 

However, as the ocean becomes more acidic, there are fewer borate ions available to react with sound waves, and more boric acid molecules that do not absorb sound as efficiently. 

This means that low-frequency sound waves can travel farther in the ocean than before."
517,Is the need for sleep an emergent property of consciousness?,"It's unlikely because some type of sleep exists in almost all animals and probably appeared early in evolution and, although we tend to believe that the purpose of sleep is to conserve energy, we really don't know why it exists and is so highly conserved.

518,Does milk sugar separate out of the milk if it settles long enough? If not why?,"Milk sugar does not separate without a lot of processing.

Lactose is about 4-5% of the weight of whole milk.  If have ever used any sort of sugar in your life, you will have noticed that sugars of almost any type dissolve in water really easily.

Evaporating about 2/3 of the water will cause the lactose to start to crystallize out.  Lactose can get up to about 18% by weight before any changes start to happen.

You can displace the lactose by adding in a metaphorical bucket of table sugar.  *Sucrose* is more soluble than lactose, so it displaces the lactose which solidifes out.  Analogy: a big strong fat man pushing into a crowded train and the little skinny person is forced out.

Heating is a poor option because lactose will react with proteins in milk.  It irreversibly glues itself to the protein."
519,Why do CO2 tanks get cold both when filled and emptied?,"Probably because it is C02 in a high pressure cylinder is a liquid not a compressed gas like nitrogen or argon.  When you are using a tank to fill another tank there is a tube in the supply tank that goes all of the way to the bottom and you are transferring liquid from one tank to the other.  When I was a helper as a teenager doing this kind of work they used a compressor between the two tanks.  I am pretty sure that this means it would end up at a lower pressure (the vapor pressure of CO2) in the receiving tank than in the hose that was supplying the liquid and thus Joule-Thompson cooling comes into play.  

When you are using CO2 gas for something like beer there is no tube and it just used the gas above the liquid."
520,"If water takes the shape of whatever container it’s in, why does water chaotically fall when put in the air without a container? Why would it not stay the same shape as the container it was in?","It's chaotic because the act of emptying it from the container introduces forces on the water which disturb it. For instance, air will rush through the water to try to fill the space that the water is evacuating, as well the container itself has friction that will drag some of the water but not all of it.

Air resistance itself will also do this, such as wester coming from a hose is nice and neat at the nozzle but quickly becomes chaotic and turned into droplets afterward.

If you were in a complete vacuum with a frictionless container you could feasibly just slide the container away from the water and have a perfectly shaped glob of water (although I think the surface tension of the water would turn it into a sphere regardless)."
521,"What concrete research/evidence is there in favor of saunas, steam rooms, and/or ice baths for post-workout recovery?","Check out Andrew Huberman(neurobiologist) on YouTube. He has a video or two that talk about hot and cold treatments with other researchers, which will give you a lot of info to include uses/benefits and protocols.

One thing I do remember as far as ice baths and fitness is that, while there are a lot of other benefits, it reduces inflammation. This can be good if you are say mid season of a given sport and you need to reduce inflammation to continue playing, but not good if you are trying to build muscle since reduced inflammation will negatively effect hypertrophy and maybe other improvements fitness areas. This being if you do cold exposure after a training session. I think they said doing it earlier in the day you won't have these effects."
522,Is wind effected by the double slit experiment?,"I think you have missed the point of the quantum double slit experiment just a little bit. The whole point of that experiment is that it was proving light can act as both a particle and wave (and so therefore demonstrate both properties) - wind is already confirmed as something which derives from particles. As such it has the behaviour of particles.

That being said however, because wind will be forced to go through the gap the wind with the path of least resistance - in other words the wind that goes straight through the gap will feel most powerful. So to answer your question, it’s not affected by the experiment but the results you’ll get will be based around the path of least resistance - which may trick you into thinking it’s a wave."
523,How has Earth's biomass changed over time?,"If you look at just mammal biomass over the last 100,00 years, The total wild mammal biomass has decreased significantly, but the total mammal biomass has exploded.

524,How long have trees been on the planet?,"The oldest tree fossils we have are about 385 million years old. But those trees have mixed traits, transitional between two of the three basic groups of trees (or any vascular plants) we have today: the tree-sized ferns (which reproduce by spores, not seeds, and can get up to 60 or 70 feet tall) and the gymnosperms (which produce seeds in cones, not flowers). There must have been plain ordinary tree ferns before that transition to gymnosperms began, but we don't know how long before, and we have no earlier fossils.

When the average English-speaker sees a tree fern or the simplest & oldest group of gymnosperms (cycads), (s)he probably normally thinks ""palm tree"", because tree ferns and cycads have the same overall form as palms: a single blocky or spikey trunk with little or no branching and a cluster of very large leaves/fronds at the top. For dozens of millions of years, that was the only form trees came in. The form that most people think of when they hear the word ""tree"", with copious branching and then branching again & again, down to lots & lots of twigs with much smaller leaves on them, which can shade the ground and cover the ground with fallen leaves, doesn't appear until about 320-300 million years ago, in the pine phylum (pines, cedars, spruces, cypresses, junipers, larches, firs, Douglas-firs, hemlocks, redwoods, and yews). Ginkgoes and angiosperms (including palm trees) would follow even later.

Before even the tree ferns & cycads, up to about 470 million years ago, there was something else that you probably wouldn't think of as a tree, but it was the biggest & tallest living thing at the time, and it was stuck to the ground, not an animal: Prototaxites. (The ""-es"" at the end is its own separate syllable.) It had the internal structure of a fungus but also some chemical hints of the presence of algae, so it's apparently either a giant fungus or a giant lichen (symbiosis of alga & fungus). Its overall shape was usually just a simple leafless column, up to 29 feet tall, although a few specimens are branched with up to 4 or 5 tips apiece. The fossils give us no sign of exactly what was on the tips."
525,How do inner ears know if we are moving?,"Part of the inner ear is the vestibular mechanism. The semi circular canals are orientated in the 3 planes - forward-back, side to side, left-right. They contain fluid and are lined by cilia - tiny hair-like structures which move with the flow of the liquid and trigger nerve impulses to the brain which are interpreted by the brain as movement or positional change. 

Combined with all of your other sensory capabilities - sight, pressure-detection (eg sitting on seat, back pressed against seat) - your brain assimilates a highly complex ‘map’ of where you are and where you are going"

528,How does a healthy human pancreas prevent low glucose?,">2 How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?

The insulin-glucagon hormone system is not the only system that can affect glucose metabolism. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have somewhat similar metabolic effects to glucagon (opposing insulin), promoting release of glucose to the blood to prepare for fight or flight. Exercise releases adrenaline and noradrenaline, helping to provide glucose to fuel the effort.

I'm actually not sure exactly how that situation would differ in diabetics. But a disruption in one of the hormone systems involved, combined with non-physiological insulin release, probably leads to less fine-tuned control of blood glucose levels."
529,[Sports Science] How important is playing sports as a kid for the development of motor control later on in life?,"Playing sports as a kid helps much later on in improving coordination, balance, agility, and overall physical fitness. Though I don't have the specifics for your other question since the extent of transfer between sports-specific skills to tasks varies.

I'll try answering your follow-up questions as best as I can so feel free to correct me:

1. Most vigorous and contact sports can contribute to the development of motor control, as they often involve dynamic movements, coordination, and physical exertion. However, different sports may emphasize different aspects of motor control, so participating in a variety of sports can provide a more well-rounded development.

2. Specific skills, such as throwing, can indeed be important to develop at a young age. They not only train the relevant muscle groups but also contribute to the development of hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and judgment of distances. Learning these skills through sports and physical activities can provide a unique experiential understanding that may be challenging to acquire through other means.

3. Learning sports skills as an adult can be challenging but also rewarding. It may require more effort and practice compared to learning as a child, but adults can still develop proficiency and enjoy the process of acquiring new skills. So be patient, persistent, and open to learning from mistakes.

These are only generalisations."
530,What are the different steps of growth for living in a shell things like oysters ?,"When oysters reproduce, the male releases sperm into the water, which is then captured by the female. Fertilization occurs internally, and the female releases eggs that are fertilized by the sperm. The fertilized eggs develop into larvae and float in the water. These larvae eventually settle onto a suitable substrate, such as a shell, where they develop into spat, which are juvenile oysters. The spat continue to grow and form their shells by extracting calcium carbonate from the surrounding water. They filter-feed on plankton and other microscopic organisms in the water to obtain nutrients for growth. Over time, the oyster continues to grow, adding layers to its shell and reaching maturity."

533,"If plasma level is low due to dehydrated human, then wouldn't a BAC test be inaccurately higher in the 1 milliliter than if he wasn't medically dehydrated from a metabolic emergency? The red blood cells hold the goodies, so if less plasma=more red then more red=more goodies per that millil","Your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is incredibly well tied to loss of function, concentration of alcohol in the brain, etc.

One test method is [gas chromatography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8027927/).  Someone takes a sample of blood and put it in a special vial.  Heat it up and the alcohol content evaporates out.  You can collect that gas and measure the concentration of alcohol.  It's a short calculation to then calculate mass of alcohol per mass/volume of blood.

Alcohol/ethanol in your body is carried everywhere there is water in your body.  It displaces water (e.g. ethanol kicks water off the team and takes it place).  Most of the water in your blood is the plasma but some will get inside the red blood cells.  

It doesn't matter if someone has higher or lower RBC.  All the test needs to know is what mass of alcohol per unit volume.

Complicated words: [BAC can be either volume or mass calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content#Units_of_measurement).  some places use a **BAC by volume**, so 0.05% BAC means that your blood is 0.05% alcohol/ethanol by volume.  Other places use **BAC by mass**, so 0.05% BAC means that 100 grams of your blood contain 0.05 g (50 mg) of alcohol/ethanol.

For a BAC all you need to know is the concentration in any part of the body and you have a really good 90%+ confidence of what the concentration is anywhere in the body.

[A dehydrated person will show a higher BAC compared to a hydrated person](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305712000585).  That also means your impairment has increased.

Worth noting, [a dehydrated person with a BAC = hydrated person BAC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24867575/) will have the same level of impairment.  However, the dehydrated person will have drunk less alcohol to have the same level of impairment.

Another test we can do to confirm the HS-GC is looking at alcohol metabolites in the blood.  Various enzymes in your body break down the alcohol to form other unique biomarkers.  It's the lab equivalent of looking through your trash for empty containers."

[This picture](https://teachmesurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Renal-Transplant-Annotated.jpg.webp) shows the kidneys in their natural place as you’d see them when face-to-face with someone, and the two ways they can be implanted (labeled A & B). As you can see, the left kidney (on the right in the image) has a longer renal vein than the right kidney, since it must cross over the midline to reach the inferior vena cava (large vertical vein, in case you don’t know), which lies on the right side of the body.

Veins are much harder to suture and connect than arteries. Veins are thinner and have a much thinner muscular layer, and have a consistency closer to wet paper compared to the rubber tube consistency of arteries. The longer vein makes it easier to connect up during the implantation procedure. This assumes that anatomy is otherwise normal; if any of the vessels (ureter isn’t technically a vessel, but also counts) are duplicated, that might prompt a right kidney to be taken instead, but it typically comes down to which one would be easier to implant.

Disclaimer: I haven’t yet completed my general surgery training, nor have I gone through my time on our transplant service yet, so my hands-on experience is minimal. I will still defer to those further trained than me."

This is unlike exercise."
539,What happens in the brain when someone gets migraine aura?,"at least in the case of the classic visual aura, where you see a scintillating pattern slowly moving out into peripheral vision, followed by a deep scotoma, the aura is almost certainly something called ""cortical spreading depression"" in primary visual cortex.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_spreading_depression

basically, starting somewhere in the foveal confluence (a twisty part of visual cortex where several visual areas converge), something happens to produce a wave of very high neural activity that lasts for several seconds, followed by deep suppression that lasts for several minutes. the wave moves at ~3mm per minute, so it takes ~20 minutes to traverse the entire primary visual cortex.

some have hypothesized that this CSD is not just correlated with but somehow causal in some types of migraine - the CSD produces biochemical waste or other sorts of imbalance that sifts through that hemisphere (maybe just through CS fluid) and irritates the trigeminal nerve (which is why the side of the aura typically is the same side the headache will be on).

years ago I recorded many of my own auras (they stopped long ago) and fit a simple cortical wave model to them. [it was pretty neat! you can read some of my journals, with figures, here:] (https://xuexixs.blogspot.com/search/label/migraine?updated-max=2012-08-16T15:24:00-04:00&max-results=20&start=32&by-date=false)"

542,How does steel produced before nuclear weapons testing and use differ from steel produced nuclear weapons testing and use?,"As others have noted, it's not about the ""quality"" of the steel, per se, so much as its lack of exposure to (and inadvertent incorporation of) man-made radioisotopes spread by atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Steel produced from the mid-1940s onward is slightly radioactive. (Actually, all steel is very, very, slightly radioactive; there are some really trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioisotopes present even in pre-1940s steel.)

The steel from old warships isn't structurally stronger, or anything like that--it's just much lower background for certain very high-sensitivity scientific applications.

On a related note, we have techniques like [bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_pulse), which dates biological specimens based on the relative ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to non-radioactive carbon-12.

(Aboveground nuclear testing resulted in a massive spike in the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, doubling its concentration between about 1955 and 1963, when the US, USSR, and UK ended such testing. Looking at the amount of carbon-14 in tissues like tooth enamel can identify when the tissue was deposited.)"
543,"Why is it that when our pupils dilate for reasons unrelated to the brightness of our environment (i.e., when we're attracted to someone) we don't seem to perceive a change in brightness in our vision?","one reason is that it's a small difference. the larger pupil dilation effects from sexual attraction (etc) are on the order of a 10% change in pupil area and thus in retinal illuminance. meanwhile, luminance discrimination thresholds are on the order of a few percent. so the change in retinal illuminance is, at most, just a bit more than you are minimally able to detect (meaning, it's perceptually pretty small).

also, the relation between increased illuminance and perceived brightness is already very compressive - for example if you increase the luminance of a target by 100%, it will only appear to be ~50% brighter. and this compression is greatly increased when you're talking about the entire scene/retina rather than a single target or object, because the retina as a whole has other gain control systems than just pupil diameter to more-or-less balance its sensitivity to current light conditions. (case in point: if you've ever had atropine put in your eyes to fully dilate your pupils, like at the eye doctor, you probably notice that everything is quite a bit brighter - but does it seem >20x brighter? Probably not, but that's about the degree of increased retinal illuminance.)

another reason is that the retina is mainly built for transmitting *contrast* information, not mean luminance. it does transmit some information about the overall brightness of a scene, but even this is only weakly correlated to physical luminance, and for the most part the retina is sending signals about *ratios* of brightness between nearby positions - and this signal is *independent of retinal illuminance* (given that there's enough light to have any signal at all). more light just makes the contrast signal clearer, but doesn't make it stronger.

so, while there probably is a perceptible effect of pupil change in these kinds of conditions (i can't find any studies where this is explicitly measured but they may exist), it's very small and probably masked by other much more significant content in the scene."

545,what is the reason behind the duffy blood group's immunity toward malaria ?,"Do you mean Duffy-negative? The Duffy antigen is a protein receptor located on the surface of blood cells and a common receptor for malarial parasites. For Duffy-negative individuals, they have resistance to malaria because the they can't bond to the Duffy protein receptor (as it is missing). It is however important to note that this does not confer blanket protection, nor does it stop one from becoming a malaria carrier."
546,What were dinosaur immune systems like? How were they different from animals today?,"Dinosaurs are of course alive today and have pretty great immune systems. Birds are modern dinosaurs and their immune systems are broadly very similar to mammalian immune systems, and work well.

(If you haven’t been paying attention to paleontology for the past 20 years, you may think that “birds are modern dinosaurs” is some well-actually technical truth that’s based on a quibble, like “well actually two sticks and a rock are technically a computer”. No.  In every sense birds *are* dinosaurs. Many dinosaurs would have looked like birds, albeit 20-foot-long birds with fangs, and there’s no reason to believe that modern dinosaur immunity is particularly different from that 100 million years ago.)

Birds, like mammals, have innate and adaptive immune system, with T and B cells in the adaptive response. B cells make antibodies that are very similar to mammalian antibodies, and antibodies are passed on to their offspring for temporary protection just as mammals pass on antibodies in their colostrum. There are a number of minor differences between the average bird and the average mammal, but most of those really are well-actually type differences - just because one class of bird antibodies is called “IgY” to mammalian “IgG” doesn’t make a functional difference. There are as many differences between mammal antibodies as between bird and mammals (see camelid antibodies, for example). 

We can also triangulate. Dinosaurs, mammals, and modern reptiles had common ancestors, so the features that mammals and modern reptiles (and modern dinosaurs) have in common were presumably present in ancient dinosaurs. Again, this includes virtually everything you’d find familiar in an immune system, including interferons an d other cytokines, the same categories of pattern-recognition molecules, the same structures for T and B cell receptors, and so on. Very broadly, immunity hasn’t changed very much since sharks invented T and B cells 400 million years ago. 

Of course the vast number of ancient dinosaurs, existing over a hundred million years, must have had variations in their immune system, as we see in the thousands of species of birds and mammals. But essentially, they would be just about the same."
547,Why are mars rover wheels made of metal?,Metal wheels are tougher and not affected as much by the lack of atmosphere (vacuum) on the surface of mars.  It's the lack of atmosphere (vacuum) that is really the bigger deal.  Plastics tend to outgas and become brittle over time with outgassing and radiation damage (Mars has almost no atmosphere- so solar radiation is much higher than on earth).  Metal wheels simply hold up better over long periods of time than plastics would.

549,How can a tsunami permanently flood a place?,"Well, you're right, it wouldn't. A tsunami wouldn't *permanently* flood an area unless it was already a basin, or unless the tsunami did some kind of severe secondary damage (e.g., breaking open a natural dam and releasing or redirecting a bunch of other water).

Some cursory research says that we think Doggerland - and anyone living there - was greatly affected by a tsunami but was already dealing with rising sea levels, and *more* rising sea levels are what finally buried it beneath the waves. The tsunami was just a bad time for anyone still living on the land that was left.

(Incidentally, though, we can and do have areas near the coast sitting below sea level - you're right that it usually ends badly, but it does happen. Notably for those in the USA, half of New Orleans is currently \~1-3 meters below sea level and sinking.)"

551,How did wings evolve?,"I will assume you are asking about feathered wings, since that is often the example used to argue against evolution. This is an example only of how they could have evolved which avoids the ""what use is half a wing"" argument.

1. Feather evolve, probably from initially slightly uprated scales which trapped air near the skin for insulation and warmth. These may have initially been only in juveniles (due to their size) and then evolution caused them to be retained into adulthood when the insulating effect proved to be advantageous. You have a feathered dinosaur 

2. Some individuals/species start to use these feathers to signal/for display purposes. Think how a cat puffs itself up to look bigger when it's afraid. Longer feathers are an advantage because they make an individual look bigger so longer feathers are selected for and the length  gets longer. 

3. Some species with the longer feathers are arborial or semi arborial, longer feathers allow them to glide between trees or trees to the ground safer or further. There is therefore more selection pressure for longer  feathers.

4. A some of these gliding feathered dinosaurs/proto-birds have slightly different muscle structure that allows a very limited form of flapping/powered flight, this gives them an advantage over simple gliding individual (they can go at at least somewhat against gravity), they are selected for and you start to get powered flight.

This would obviously occur over millions of years and many species would evolve and die out before you compete the transition from non-avian dinosaurs to birds.

However the basic principle in this idea is that each step has an evolutionary advantage in and of itself, remember evolution does not have a plan or a final form it is aiming for. Each step must be able to survive and reproduce (be evolutionarily fit) in and of itself. It is also vital but often hard to grasp just what kind of time period we are thinking about for the evolution of significant features such as wings

(The wings of bats would probably have evolved similarly, loose skin with another purpose gave an advantage to a gliding species so exaggeration of the feature was selected for, then active flight evolved from this gliding species)"
552,Does the dead bodies of deep sea creatures float to the surface or does it stay underwater?,"Some does and other stuff doesn’t isn’t really a very satisfying answer so I will try and generalise as so much different stuff lives in the sea.

The seabed is full of creatures who rely on the “detritus” of dead stuff sinking to the bottom for their food supply so generally speaking as stuff decays it will sink to the bottom.   Plankton that thrives at the surface does sink very slowly when it dies so there is a constant shower of microscopic creatures alive and dead throughout the water column.

There is stuff that floats to the surface when it is pulled up by the tides like some seaweeds that are naturally buoyant so they can stand upright from the seabed.  Much of this floats on the surface and even reaches the beaches some of that floating debris may have creatures attached to it.  It then rots on the beaches and gets dragged back into the sea and sinks. 

However when boats discharge “bycatch” some of it may float on the surface but that’s mainly because the cavities inside the creature that are normally squeezed closed by the ocean pressures have filled up with air by being brought to the surface. Again as it decomposes what isn’t picked of the surface by scavengers will sink to the bottom."
553,How did the conventions for describing the electromagnetic spectrum originate?,"Radio waves are defined with Mhz and Ghz, because electronics use Herz for clock speeds, and in the early days of radio frequency (before microwaves) these waves were predominantly made by electronics.

High-energy waves like x-rays and gamma are similarly defined by the field they mostly serve. Gamma is almost exclusively used in particle physics, where energy and specifically electron-volt, is front and center of almost any discussion.

Visible light or near visible light was mostly studied in optics at first, where wavelength is a major property (light bends differently at different wavelengths). Of course Herz could work here as well, but the term wavelength predates Herz, and optics predates... Anything almost"
554,What causes different variants of prion diseases?,"There are three general ways prion diseases come about. Some people have a genetic mutation that results in prions being produced rather than normal version. They will eventually develop disease later in life, the type dependent on the mutation. Sporadic is believed to be someone who does not have that genetic background but somewhere along in their life a protein misfolds somehow creating a prion out of a normal protein. Usually happens  later in life, there is some ideas on how this might come about but we don't know for sure. The third way (variant) is ingesting or otherwise having prions introduced into your body. The most common is the sporadic form, followed by genetic then by variant. That said it is a pretty rare disease only happening in one in a million people."
555,"How was it determined which group of animals would be true crabs, and which would be false crabs?","The word ""crab"" is much older than the science of sorting animals into families and orders and genuses and species. To the Germanic peoples who fished along the Northern European coast, the animals they called [""krabbi"" or ""crabba"" or ""crabs""](https://www.etymonline.com/word/crab) were *most commonly* the European green crab, but more generally  meant anything in the water that had pincers, a bunch of legs, and a short or missing tail.

In 1758, Carl Linnaeus published his tenth edition of *Systema Naturae*, in which he organized thousands of animals under classes, orders, and genera. Crabs, lobsters and their kin all fell under *Insecta*, and having no wings, the order *Aptera*. To separate them from other ""wingless insects"" like spiders, centipedes and termites, Linnaeus [assigned them all to the genus *Cancer*, the Latin word for ""crab""](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/647/mode/1up). (Like most scientific works of that time, *Systema Naturae* was published in Latin.)

So at this point in history, according to Linnaeus, *all* hard-shelled sea creatures with ten legs and pincers were ""crabs"" (or at least *Cancer*), including not just today's ""false crabs"", but also lobsters, shrimp, and some parasites! The European green crab was *Cancer maenus*, the American lobster was *Cancer homerus*, etc, etc.

Nevertheless, Linnaeus separated *Cancer* into two sub-groups: the *brachyuri* (Greek for ""short tails""), which were the ""crab"" crabs, the members of *Cancer* that one might also find called ""crab"" on a dinner plate or at a fish market. The other sub-group of *Cancer* was called the *macrouri* (Greek for ""long tails""). By the 12th edition, [hermit crabs were included among the ""long tails""](https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN362053723?tify=%7B%22pages%22%3A%5B516%5D%2C%22pan%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A0.451%2C%22y%22%3A0.959%7D%2C%22view%22%3A%22toc%22%2C%22zoom%22%3A0.275%7D) as *Cancer tubularis*; king crabs were placed among the short-tails as *Cancer maja*.

Linnaeus eventually died, and others expanded on his work, greatly increasing the number of orders and genera, and rearranging genera as our understanding of their relationships to one another improved. *Cancer* was eventually split into hundreds of different genera...

...but the brachyuran ""short tails"" and the macrouran ""long tails"" remained. Except instead of being sub-groupings of a single genera *Cancer*, these became ""infraorders"", and the many renamed genera were assigned to one or the other. At this point, any brachyuran was considered a ""crab"", and the macrourans were ""not crabs"".

Between 1834 and 1840, H. Milne Edwards published [*Histoire Naturelle des Crustacés*](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/318991), in which he redefined relationships between various crustacean genera and introduced a third infraorder: the *Anomura*, meaning ""different tailed"". Into this (much smaller) group went members of both the *Brachyura* and *Macroura* that didn't quite fit into either parent group...including the formerly brachyuran king crab, and the formerly macrouran hermit crab.

And so, this brings us more or less to the present day. *Macroura* has since been retired as an infraorder, but *Brachyura* and *Anomura* remain. And *Brachyura* is *huge*, over 7,000 species across 98 different famlies...there are about as many ""true crabs"" as there are *all other decapods*, including false crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. (In the *Anomura*, there are \~500 species of hermit crab and \~100 species of king crab, for example.)

So. How did we determine which groups to call ""true crabs""? We started with a huge group called *Cancer* (Latin for ""crab"") that contained basically every crustacean, and gradually took other things out of that group that weren't as closely related...in the process removing some other animals called ""crabs"" like hermit crabs, porcelain crabs, and king crabs.

And was there a scenario where the classification could have been reversed? Not very likely...the number of ""true crabs"" is so large, and they are all more closely related to each other than any of them are to something like a king crab or a hermit crab...their sheer abundance, combined with their familiarity as a food source, made it most likely that they would always end up being the ""true"" crabs."

557,What happened to peak oil?,"As a concept, it still exists, e.g., some recent papers have suggested that yet again, we're about 10-15 years from [peak oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil) (e.g., [Delannoy et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921011673)). 

In terms of what happened such that concerns about peak oil that were prevalent in the early 2000s largely (at least temporarily) vanished? Basically, a sudden rise in oil production after ~2010 (e.g., [this graph of US oil production minus Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil#/media/File:Hubbert_Upper-Bound_Peak_1956.png)), which, in short, reflected the new-found ability to economically develop unconventional reservoirs, i.e., the ""shale revolution"". Much of this has to do with ""tight"" reservoirs, i.e., rocks - like shales - containing lots of oil and gas but where that oil and gas is hosted in rock with very low porosity. Tight reservoirs were largely unexploitable because the porosity was so low that if you sank a nearly vertical well and extracted from it, you would basically just get the oil/gas right next to the well bore but then virtually no fluids would be able to move in to replace those (and thus you in no way were able to extract enough oil/gas to recoup the cost of drilling the well). What changed by around 2010 was the ability to economically develop these reservoirs through a variety of advancements in production and extraction technology that had been developing over the prior decades. A lot of the focus is often put on hydraulic fracturing, i.e., ""fracking"", which was definitely critically important, but what sometimes does not get as much attention are advancements in direction and horizontal drilling by which you could drill parallel to the surface over long distances (with branches off, etc). Neither of these were new as of 2010, but the combination of them (along with increases in efficiency and capabilities of both) allowed for horizontal drilling, at depth over large distances, within these tight reservoirs and to then frack along these paths to increase the porosity enough to where you can start to extract large amounts of the fluids within these formations (i.e., enough to recoup the cost of drilling and operate with a profit). There were a few other techniques that were important (e.g., various ""enhanced recovery"" methods where you flush a reservoir with a variety of fluids by pumping in fluids from one set of wells along with extracting fluids + oil picked up along the way from another set, etc.) but directional drilling and hydrofracturing were really the big ones for getting at ""tight"" oil, and thus allowing for a sudden resurgence in oil production. 

This, somewhat overnight, opened up *huge* reservoirs, that had been known about for decades but were never really economical to exploit. Returning to the production in the US, if you look at oil production split out by conventional vs unconventional (i.e., tight), you can see that [conventional production basically followed the Hubbert projected decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil#/media/File:OilProductionTightTotalHubbert-dec2021.svg) and virtually all of this new production was in tight reservoirs. If we circle back to renewed suggestions of a coming peak (e.g., the paper cited at the top of this), it's a little more of the same in the sense in that we've been hitting unconventional resources hard for the last decade+, and these, just like conventional, are finite. The difference now is, as best we can tell, there isn't much in the way of similar resources to what unconventionals were before we could extract them. I.e., if we consider the 2000s, we saw that production was declining or plateauing globally, but we knew about tight reservoirs and that they had a lot of usable petroleum products in them but lacked the tech to get them, which fueled a drive to develop said tech. Now, there's not really an equivalent ""we know there's a ton of petroleum in X, but we can't get it"". This is also superimposed on a different economic, political, regulatory, and societal landscape compared to 10-20 years ago, related to the proliferation of variety of renewable power generation methods, growing concern about climate change, etc."
558,"Can one Red Blood Cell have two or more types of Hemoglobin ( like HbF, HbA1, etc) ?","Each red blood cell carries around 270 million hemoglobin molecules. In adults, these are normal percentages of different hemoglobin molecules:

HbE: Absent

HbF: 0.8% to 2% (0.008 to 0.02)

561,"In an oxygen-free environment or vacuum, would a very hot piece of wood melt? What about meat?","Initially, in a biological substance like wood or meat, there will be chemical substances like water or light organic molecules within the mix of chemical substances. As the temperature rises, these will boil off at their respective boiling points. At a higher temperature, pyrolysis will take place, where complex organic molecules break down, with the chemical structure of the molecules coming apart and the different elements ending up as different, simpler compounds. The result will be a bunch of steam, nitrogen, hydrogen and other light molecules, and a solid core of carbon graphite. This is essentially what happens when you burn wood into charcoal, you drive off the lighter compounds and reform the wood into near pure carbon. Eventually, if the temperature is high enough, the carbon will melt, but that happens at a very high temperature indeed."
562,Is there a more active season for spiders?,"Many spiders will die overwinter, including many orb weaving species (the ones with webs in the air that you describe on the trail). Females will lay a clutch of eggs and the young spiders will disperse in the spring (some through a cool method known as ballooning, where they exude a line of silk and use it to float away in the wind to allow for increased area dispersion) so this inherently will mean a larger amount of spiders in the initial warming months of the year as the young spiders are born and populate the area. It might be you also run in an area that is less traveled, leading to more webs on the trail itself.

Secondly, people notice many more male spiders in the fall months, as males begin to wander in search of mates and are more likely to come in contact with humans, this also is when people tend to see certain species of spider more often."
563,Has any research been done on the impact of atmospheric pressure on seismic activity?,"> Has any research been done on the impact of atmospheric pressure on seismic activity?

Yes, this is a question that geologists/seismologists have considered for a long time (e.g., [Landsberg, 1940](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/TR021i002p00227)).

> My reasoning is that if the earth's surface/crust experiences less pressure due to changes in atmospheric pressure, then maybe seismic movement can occur easier than usual.

So broadly, the underlying logic is sound, i.e., anything that can change the stress state in the crust can *potentially* change some details of the statistics of earthquakes making a given event that is near failure either more or less likely to occur depending on the nature of the change in stress state. In terms of surface influences, the most common consideration is that some processes that reduces mass above a fault (e.g., less surface water) effectively reduces the normal stress on the fault and means that the shear stress required for the fault to slip is less (i.e., it's an easier for an earthquake to occur), but there are other mechanisms by which these surface changes can potentially influence fault and earthquake behavior. In detail, a variety of surface details, mostly related to hydrologic changes (e.g., changes in groundwater, changes in snow mass, changes in precipitation, etc) have been suggested to modulate the detailed statistics of earthquakes (e.g., consider the discussions and linked papers in these two FAQs, [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_seasons/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/climate_change_earthquakes/)). 

Now, the trick with barometric pressure changes potentially working in this way is that these tend to be *very small* compared to things like changes in water mass. Per the Landsberg reference, they've been considered, but even in that review, it was generally assumed that they were not of sufficient magnitude to actually do much. There have been occasional suggestions that barometric pressure changes could influence subtle statistics of earthquake sequences, like those observed in the sequence following the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (e.g., [Gao et al., 2000](https://www.nature.com/articles/35020045)), but subsequent work has shown that these are likely better explained by seasonal variation in hydrology (e.g., [Johnson et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aak9547)). Similarly, there was a lot of buzz around the result from [Liu et al., 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08042), which suggested that the low pressure from systems like typhoons might be sufficient to trigger so-called [slow earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_earthquake) at subduction zones (like Taiwan), but again, subsequent work has suggested that the triggering attributed originally to barometric pressure changes are probably better explained by (larger) changes in water masses (e.g., [Hsu et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JB011807)).

**TL;DR** It's been researched and occasionally there's been results that are suggestive of barometric pressure changes being able to influence the exact timing of earthquakes or earthquake like processes, but few of them have held up to scrutiny and most seem better explained with changes in water mass instead."
564,How do semi-permeable membranes work ?,"As far as size goes it's a little more complicated than molecule vs molecule. Essentially the salt must be in solution for your situation. Salt will dissolve into the water as ions, which in turn attract water molecules since they are slightly polar. 

This is known as the hydration sphere for the water solvent in this case, or solvation shell more generally. The hydration sphere comprising the ion plus a number of water molecules will be larger than a single water molecule to answer your question."
565,How do modern navigation aids account for irregularities in the shape of Earth?,"> Don’t these presuppose a perfect globe

No, they do not. For horizontal coordinates, modern coordinate systems approximate the shape of the Earth as an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid), which we refer to as a [reference ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid#Reference_ellipsoid). A given reference ellipsoid can be defined with a length of the semi-major axis (i.e., the equatorial radius), the semi-minor axis (i.e., the polar radius), and the flattening, though in practice you only need two of these quantities to define the ellipsoid shape and the most common to report are the semi-major axis and the flattening (or its inverse).

> how do they deal with the major irregularities in the shape of Earth?

Let's consider a [geographic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) (as opposed to a [projected coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projected_coordinate_system)), and specifically [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS_84), which is the most recent version of the ""World Geodetic System"" and one of the more common sets of geographic coordinate systems you'd be likely to encounter. WGS84 is one version of a [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum), basically the shape of the oblate spheroid that is used to approximate the shape of the Earth. Chances are if coordinates are reported in latitude and longitude, these are given in WGS84, though not always, for example if you're using a topographic map in the US, it might be in NAD83 (a different geodetic datum)  though these two should give relatively similar coordinates, but other geodetic datums can be quite different depending on the values they use for the properties of the ellipsoid, i.e., semi-major axis, flattening. The differences in these parameters can reflect more accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth (e.g., the differences between WGS84 and the earlier versions like WGS60, etc), or if we are considering a ""local datum"", it may use a semi-major axis and flattening that better approximates the shape of the Earth for the region for which the datum is defined, but is worse if you were to use it for the entire planet.

Thus, while we think of latitude and longitude as angular measurements on the surface of a sphere (e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#/media/File:Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg)), in reality (at least for modern uses of these), they are angular measurements on the surface of an ellipsoid / oblate spheroid. This is why the meridian distance (in km, but you could do it miles, etc) between degrees of latitude actually change as a function of latitude (e.g., the [table and/or formula for WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#Meridian_distance_on_the_ellipsoid) here). If we approximated the Earth as sphere for these coordinates (as we did before we had accurate measurements of the ""figure of the Earth""), the meridian distance for latitude would be constant (but it would still change for longitude, going from a maximum at the equator to zero at the poles). 

Finally, all of the above has been concerned with the horizontal datum (i.e., latitude and longitude), but to uniquely define a coordinate, we also need to consider the vertical position, and thus the vertical datum that is used. Here, most modern coordinate systems do not use the ellipsoid to reference the elevation of a point, but instead use the vertical position relative to the [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid), i.e., what the surface of a global ocean would be accounting for mass differences and rotation, but ignoring winds, currents, and tides, etc. In some very specific circumstances, an ellipsoidal vertical datum might be used (i.e., referencing elevations with respect to the surface of the ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth), but generally, if you are given a latitude, longitude, and elevation for a point, the latitude and longitude will be with reference to a specific ellipsoid (i.e., the horizontal datum) and the elevation will be with reference to a specific geoid (i.e., the vertical datum)."
566,How do cancer vaccines stand out from other strategies with immunotherapy?,"Cancer vaccines are targeted against antigens which only or predominantly exist in cancer cells in order to stimulate the immune system against it. Often this is done by introducing RNA, coding for the respective antigen(s). There are two major hallmarks that make this a complicated task.

a) it is far from trivial to choose the correct antigen(s). Besides them really needing to be specific for the cancer, you also face a rapidly mutating environment and massive differences between patients. This is also why personalized therapies are a thing (like biontechs inest approach) in development. This is in top of cancer being not one single illness, but hundreds.

b) you need to deliver a substantial amount of the antigen coding RNA via the correct route, also targeting the correct tissue etc. This is far from trivial, since you at best want to be precise, but end up rather systemic with nuances.

These two things are not that complicated in, let's say, infectious diseases, such as COVID, where you have a pretty distinct target (like spike) and also can be pretty systemic with the administration."
567,What is the current state of the art for dealing with nuclear waste?,"Stick it in water until it cools down a bit.

Then stick it inside a steel can.

Then bury the can in a big hole and fill the hole with cement.

The idea behind doing this is to create a ""low Eh, high pH"" environment (when cement dissolves the solution is alkaline). The iron corrodes to form Fe3+ ions and, since iron is more reactive than the radioactive isotopes, such as plutonium, they remain as metals rather than becoming more mobile ions. Most metal hydroxides are also insoluble so the alkaline conditions help keep any ions that do form solid and less mobile.

The plan (and certainly the requirement in the UK, at least a few years ago) was that the radioactives had to stay put for a million years. Quite how anybody can guarantee the waste remains safely in a repository for way longer than any country on earth has existed isn't something anybody wants to talk about."

570,What limits the exhaust velocity of an ion thruster?,"We could accelerate the propellant to higher speeds. For electrostatic thrusters you can more or less just increase the acceleration voltage and the propellant will got faster. Once you get into the tens of kilovolt it starts to get tricky with insulation and electronics design unless you make the thruster enormous and heavy.

However you don't really want to do that usually. The faster the exhaust the more energy you need (it scales with the square of the speed). And the power on board a spacecraft is limited so you either have to increase the power generation (more solar panels typically) or decrease the quantity of propellant you eject, which decreases the thrust. Both of those options result in a slower acceleration and longer transit times and it just becomes impractical. You can calculate the optimal exhaust velocity for a given power to mass ratio and mission and for most spacecraft it's between 15 and 35 km/s. It would only make sense to go faster if you had an incredibly light power source (say a good nuclear reactor)."
571,why do immune complex and antibodies accumulate in joints during an infection?,"They can accumulate in other tissues, it’s a matter of how much though. Immune complexes can deposit in any end organ in capillaries and cause local inflammation/damage. There is infection mediated lung capillary damage, kidney damage, skin damage, etc all from immune complex deposition which can lead to unchecked immune responses. Joints don’t need much deposition though to cause pain which is why this is such a common area, while you really need a substantial accumulation for significant kidney damage for example.

One example is post strep/staph glomerulonephrits. 

 Not all autoimmunity has anything to do with immune complexes though. Crohns and UC cause arthritis and other symptoms through direct cell mediated attack on tissues outside the GI tract ."

573,How can a nerve that detects temperature be tuned to fire based on the speed at which air molecules are moving against our skin.. how would that even work?,"You're right that air temperature can be seen as a measure of how much kinetic energy the air molecules have. But, our skin also has its own temperature. The molecules in our cells are vibrating as well.

  
When our skin is exposed to air, what's happening is a bunch of elastic collisions between our skin molecules and the air molecules. Energy will be transferred in each collision: the air molecule will end up moving either faster or slower after the collision, either taking or giving energy to the skin molecule. Which happens in any given collision is random. However, on average if all the skin molecules are moving very slowly, most of the time the air molecule will impart energy to the skin.. and on average if all the skin molecules are vibrating very quickly, most of the time the skin molecule will impart energy to the air. As energy is transferred, the temperature of both skin and air will change. Eventually, even though on each collision there will still be either energy gained or lost, on average there will be no further energy transfer - the two surfaces will reach thermal equilibrium, both at the same temperature.

  
Our nerve endings are really sensing the temperature of our skin, not the temperature of the air. In cold air, the skin will be cold, and in hot air, the skin will be hot. As skin temp rises, the molecules inside the nerve endings will be vibrating and jostling faster. Chemical reaction rates change inside the nerve ending as the temperature rises or cools, and the nerve is set up to detect those changes and communicate what's happening back to the brain."

576,Why hasn't anyone looked into building a super wind turbine in tornado alley?,"For this; (1) lets assume we're interested in trying to harness wind energy from tornadoes specifically as opposed to targeting the storms that generate tornadoes as a whole and (2) we'll skip over the (large) engineering challenges of building a turbine that would not only survive a tornado, but actually be able to continue to function during one and generate more power as wind speed increases. Toward that last point, we're skipping over what the actual power curve of turbines look like (e.g., [the discussion and graph on this page](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-do-wind-turbines-survive-severe-storms)). Specifically that as wind speed increases, power output increases up to a point until it reaches its ""rated speed"", basically the wind speed and power generation the turbine can generate power and not damage itself, and power generation stays constant until it hits the ""cut-off speed"", basically the wind speed where the turbine would be damaged if it kept generating power. 

From above, for our hypothetical ""tornado turbine"" to be useful, it would need to either have a *very large* rated and/or cut-off speed and ideally  have a somewhat monotonic wind speed to power generated curve, i.e., we always get more power for higher wind speeds (for the purposes of this question, through *magic* as far as we're concerned). However, even if we assume that was possible, it quickly becomes apparent that we'd have to build *lots* of these turbines and that virtually all of them would never actually encounter a tornado. For this, we can consider a map of [tornado tracks in the US from 1950-2022](https://mrcc.purdue.edu/gismaps/cntytorn.htm#). What should be apparent here is that yes, there are lots of tornadoes, but importantly, if we think about placement of a turbine in a specific location (and considering that tornadoes generally have pretty small footprints), there are *very few* places we could put one that during this 70 year period would even encounter one tornado, let alone encountering even 2-3. 

Considering all that, we can see that the better strategy is to just build turbines where we tend to have high average wind speeds (which is broadly what has been done in the US, e.g., [the map on this page](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/wind-turbines-bigger-better)). There is definitely already some decent overlap in terms of where we build turbines and where there are relatively high densities of tornadoes, but going through the hassle of trying to engineer a turbine to usefully extract wind energy from a tornado is not likely to be worth it given the low probability (both in time and space) that our hypothetical turbine would ever be in the right place to interact with a tornado.

**TL;DR** ignoring the engineering challenges of making a turbine that wouldn't break itself during extreme winds, the probability that any fixed spot will experience a tornado during the lifetime of a turbine is exceedingly low."
577,"Why is it that the further north you go, the more intense the mosquitoes are?","The short summer. Arctic mosquito species eggs can survive being frozen in the winter, then hatch in the spring meltwater pools and grow for a couple of weeks as larvae before becoming the flying adults. No mosquito species can be active in the cold, 15-25 C is a good air temperature zone for them.

Presumably a late hatching mosquito would find little food to eat as a larva (ot already got scoffed by the earlier hatchlings) and few potential mates as an adult, and risk being killed if the cold returns early, so the selection pressure is for them to hatch and grow as early as the weather allows.

In the tropics there isn’t that seasonality and mosquito activity is spread through the year instead of being concentrated in one or two months.

583,Why is red/ginger hair a recessive gene in humans but seemingly not in cats?,"First, technically its an allele rather than a gene. A gene codes for some aspect of the phenotype (appearance), an allele is a varient of a gene that has arising by random mutation. The same mutation can occur twice but it is unlikely, particually when the last common ancestor between two species is so long ago (its also unlikely that the allele has been inherited from the common ancestor and preserved in both species, given the time scales invovled).

Second, cat and human hair colour are not controlled by the same gene (or set of genes). One of thr key coat colour genes for cats is on the X chromosome (this been by you typically can't get tortoiseshell male cats), but as far I as know the human hair colour genes are located on different chromosomes (I deal with animal genetics rather than human).

So basically the reason that a colour might be recessive in some species but not another is that they occur due different gene and allele combiations, which means there will be different dominace interactions between alleles."

585,"Volcanic eruptions, global warming and global “cooling!?”","> If the surface temperature of the earth is increasing, even slightly, due to the many factors that contribute to it, would the core of the earth also be increasing in heat? If so, Is there any way to know what 1 degree Celsius increase of surface temp would equate to in terms of the core of the earths temperature rising? Or is this concept fundamentally wrong?

The last option, i.e., this is a fundamentally flawed premise because surface temperature variations (at least of the magnitude we're considering here) have no measurable effect on the internal heat of the Earth, especially by the time we're at the core (or really, even within the lithosphere). In detail, the surface temperature will have an effect on the temperature gradient at depth, but this is basically limited to the few upper tens of meters and the influence is effectively zero within a few kilometers of the surface (where the temperature at depth would generally follow the [geothermal gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient)). Thus, while the current and projected changes in surface temperature from anthropogenic climate change are significantly impacting details of the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere, it's not measurably changing anything about the internal heat of the Earth.

> If it’s not wrong, could an increase in the earths core temperature increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions

So as established above, this mechanism does not work. There is however a suggestion that climate change might cause additional volcanism in certain circumstances. Specifically, reduction in land-based iced volumes in volcanic areas (e.g., Iceland) removes mass (locally, i.e., ice melts and flows into the ocean) which causes uplift and which can induce additional melting in existing volcanic systems and thus potentially lead to a pulse of eruptive activity (e.g., [Pagli & Sigmundsson, 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL033510), [Tuffen, 2010](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2010.0063), [Cooper et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825217301629)). Importantly, this would only predict increases in volcanism in regions with significant existing glacial cover that is reduced through melting and so would not cause global changes in volcanism rates. 

> ultimately leading to more global “cooling” due to the effect of volcanic eruptions?

Considering above, maybe, but there are many caveats and nuances. The critical bit is that it's not as though every volcanic eruption has a demonstrable cooling effect. As discussed in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/volcanic_eruption_climate_change/), there are somewhat specific aspects of individual eruptions that can make a climate effect more or less likely (and controls the magnitude of that effect). Additionally, as discussed in [this other AskScience thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1090w5h/can_a_major_volcanic_eruption_save_us_from_global/) the interaction of cooling from a volcanic eruption in the context of anthropogenic climate change is tricky, e.g., the paper discussed there suggests that given the right conditions a large volcanic eruption could cause cooling for a bit but it would be followed by accelerated warming (i.e., after a few decades, the effect would basically average out to being the same as if there was no eruption)."
586,"If someone with a small nose reproduces with a larger nosed person, what happens?","So the specific example of noses may seem frivolous, but the overall question is actually fundamental for lots of questions, and deeply puzzled some very smart people 150 years ago.

The question describes what *seems* to be two different kinds of inheritance. One (eye color) is the relatively familiar Mendelian inheritance we learned in grade 8. (I know it's not truly Mendelian inheritance, most things are not when you look carefully, but it's close enough.) With Mendelian inheritance -- oversimplified as aways -- there is a ""gene"" for A, which can manifest in two different forms -- wrinkled or smooth peas; blue or brown eyes -- and the offspring end up with one of those two options. 

But that's not how most inheritance works. A tall mother and a small father don't end up with kids who are either tall or small; their children may be in between, with a wide range of heights (and not unusually, some may be taller than the tall parent, or smaller than the small one). If one parent has a big nose and the other has a small one, the kids may have noses that are moderate sized. This *looks like* blending inheritance.  

>Blending inheritance is an obsolete theory in biology from the 19th century. The theory is that the progeny inherits any characteristic as the average of the parents' values of that characteristic. As an example of this, a crossing of a red flower variety with a white variety of the same species would yield pink-flowered offspring.

--[Blending inheritance on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blending_inheritance)

Why is this important? It's important because evolution through natural selection *doesn't work* if blending inheritance is true. (Darwin knew this, spent a lot of time trying to come up with explanations, and never succeeded fully. A prediction of his theory was therefore that blending inheritance was false, which Mendel had already demonstrated though Darwin didn't know it.)

In fact, ""Mendelian inheritance"" and ""blending inheritance"" look the same in the first generation *if there are enough genes involved*.  If there's only one gene that contributes to height, then ""tall"" and ""small"" are really the only options. If there are two, then tall, small, and medium may be options. If there are ten, then there may be 2^10 = 1000 options. If 100 genes contribute to height, the output in the first generation of an all-tall and all-small cross should be a smooth, normal distribution of heights. And crucially, all the genes are still present, and the subsequent generations can re-assemble the original phenotype as well as new variations, even without new mutations (which Darwin also didn't know about, of course).  

So the key to this question is that most interesting aspects of an individual aren't ""caused"" by one or two genes. The media often talk about ""the gene for"" violence, or disease resistance, or height, or whatever. That's nonsense. Most of these things are ""caused"" by hundreds or thousands of genes, each contributing a fraction of a percent to the phenotype. Tall people don't have ""the gene"" for height, they have maybe a hundred of the thousand genes that tend towards height (to say nothing of environmental influences). 

Simple, one- or two-gene aspects do exist, but they're really unusual. Once you think about things as the product of hundreds of interactions, a lot of inheritance becomes more clear. (Of course, if makes it much harder to track does disease-protective genes and so on.)"
587,"if a mosquito drinks the blood of an intoxicated person, does it poison the mosquito?","Even at 0.5% BAC, the alcohol would likely be too dilute to affect the mosquito. Biologically, mosquitoes also process the fluid in a gut pouch before it interacts with other body systems so there's potential the alcohol would be broken down beforehand. Insect neurology is very far from my field so this is conjecture, but I would wonder if mosquitoes even have GABA receptors for ethanol.

Ultimately though everything is a poison at the right concentration. Alcohol vapor can definitely kill mosquitoes.

Interestingly enough, I found a [paper on ivermectin mass drug administrations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22493855/) killing mosquitoes that bite humans which makes sense given we [similarly poison our pets to prevent disease/infestations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milbemycin_oxime)."
588,Are levels of self-esteem 'contagious' in group settings?,"External psychological forces have been known to be influential on others. Empathic neurology via mirror neurons can trigger endorphins (think babies when they see a person genuinely smile). Also, people's group think can be highly influenced by the ""hype"" of others. So i believe it is correct to say that groups can definitely influence the release of endorphins and hormones in others, but it's a double edged sword as endorphins and hormones such as oxytocin, while primarily thought of as promoting ""good feelings"" can also influence how we process negative emotions and have been shown to increase violence and antipathy when individuals are confronted with people considered ""outsiders"".

Edit: The original question was in regards to self esteem and i seem to have left that unaddressed. I think the feeling of strength in numbers as well as everything I posted previously can influence ones sense of self-esteem through endorphins, hormones, and a sense of belonging, but whether this translates into individual, self actualization within an individual that carries on after removing oneself from the group is not something i am aware of having been studied. Perhaps someone can research academic literature on the subject and find a research paper with more evidence. However anecdotally, i think you can view those who come from healthy and supportive families that encourage one another as a type of evidence to support this idea."
589,What would happen if you made a gigantic sphere of water in space?,"When people say ""water is incompressible"" we mean ""for calculation purposes, you can assume water is incompressible."" However, there is a really easy way to see that water is, in face, compressible- sound travels through water. Sound is sent via compression waves, so if the water could not compress, sound would not travel through it. But water is really hard to compress very much. For instance, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, water is still over 90% of the volume it has on the surface. 

So, put a whole bunch of water somewhere in space (like a whole whole bunch) yes, it would compress and would even start a fusion reaction (it would get hot enough due to compression that the hydrogen and oxygen would break their bond, and the H atoms would start a fusion chain)."

There's so much going on here that entire textbooks are written about it. But in a very clumsy attempt to summarise it into reddit post length: cells start sending out different chemical messages based on external factors. An important one is spatial orientation with respect to gravity. Cells closer to the gravitational centre will start producing chemical signals that are different from the cells furthest from the gravitational centre. These chemicals diffuse through the developing organism and cells start to receive different messages about how they should express their genes based on a ""concentration gradient"". Put simply, the cells closer to the source of the signalling molecules will receive a larger dose than those further away and the genes they express become differentiated based on this difference in concentration of ""dose"". Once this initial differentiation is achieved, increasingly complex signals are sent to neighbouring cells based on prior differentiation. It's very complicated but you could read up on something called the ""French Flag Model"" in embryology to get a beginners grasp of what is going on."
591,Can planes just levitate above the ground and wait for the earth to rotate?,"So this is a pretty common question, and the really simple answer is Newton's First Law: an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. While you're on the train, you're in motion going forward. When you jump, the only force acting on you is a force up, so you do go up, but nothing pushing you back, so you keep moving forward. 

But this leads to a discussion about how to think about these topics. Think about being on the train. If being in contact with the train is what kept you moving with the train, well then the only place you're in contact with the train while standing is your feet. Do you feel a strong force pushing the soles of your shoes forward as you move along? Since it's not, it can't be the contact between you and the train doing it. However, when the train is first taking off, or when it is stopping, you do feel a force between your shoes and the train. And if you were to jump while the train was braking hard, you would fly forward into whatever was in front of you on the train. This is because of the same law as mentioned above. When the train is at a standstill, you are too, and the only way to get you moving is to apply a force to you. So as the engine applies a force on the train to get it to move, the train has to apply a force to you (if you're standing through your shoes) to get you to move too. Once you're moving, you'll stay moving unless a force acts on you. So, when the brakes apply a force to the train, the train has to apply a force on you to stop you. So, if you're in the air for either of these times, the train can't apply that force, and you'll move forwards or backwards (in the train- really staying stationary as measured by the Earth). 

Planes are pretty similar. If you live in the US the rotation speed of the Earth is around 700 mph (faster down south, slower up north, but on average). Of course, when you go outside, there isn't a 700 mph wind in your face all the time. Because the atmosphere is rotating with the Earth. Plane and helicopters, etc are all flying through the atmosphere, and the atmosphere rotates with the Earth, so just hovering there wouldn't get you anywhere new. 

But even without the atmosphere, the movement you inherit from the Earth matters. For space ships, it's why we like to launch from down south (in the US, we launch from the tip of Florida). Why? Because we get a speed boost- the rotation of the Earth gives our rocket ship a boost. As it takes off, it also has the speed of the Earth's rotation, so once it's out of the atmosphere and needs speed to get to orbit, that speed is gotten ""for free."""
592,Why do GLP-1 agonists cause retinopathy?,"According to this article, ANY therapy that causes rapid onset glycemic control is associated with a higher *short term* risk of retinopathy, while also being associated with a *lower* long-term risk, and the exact mechanism is not really understood yet.

>	In conclusion, our data suggest that the strongest relationship between GLP-1RA treatment and early worsening of retinopathy after drug initiation is via their impact on HbA1c; however, without dedicated trials designed to evaluate the impact on retinopathy, a direct mechanism attributable to one or more drugs in this class cannot be excluded. In this respect, care for those initiating GLP-1RA treatment should not differ from care provided for patients initiating any type of intensive glucose-lowering therapy. Early detection and treatment of retinopathy remains the standard of care. Screening for retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes is recommended from the time of diagnosis and typically annually thereafter, depending on the level of glycemic control and retinopathy status (28). Those with severe, proliferative retinopathy should undergo treatment for retinopathy before or in conjunction with the initiation of intensive glucose-lowering therapy. Progression of diabetic retinopathy due to intensified glycemic control is typically transient and reversible over a longer period of time (29). Even with the potential for initial progression of retinopathy, intensive glycemic treatment reduces risk for the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy over time compared with conventional treatment (29). Current recommendations that GLP-1RAs be used early in the treatment of type 2 diabetes acknowledge their effective glucose-lowering effects and associated potential for weight loss and low risk of hypoglycemia. As with any potent glucose-lowering agent, clinicians should consider retinopathy status at the time of treatment initiation and follow guidelines for monitoring in patients with established retinopathy.

If you move your hands closer to the surface, you'll see the shadows shrink until you touch the surface. At which point they're the same size as their shadows.

596,"Can the human body ""produce"" vitamins by taking the building blocks of vitamins (from food) and reassembling them?","In the early 1900s, our understanding of nutrition basically boiled down to ""food is fuel"". Whatever food you ate, as long as it had protein, carbohydrates, and fat, your body would turn those three into either energy or raw materials for making whatever it needed. As long as you had an optimal balance of those three, *nothing* else in the diet was needed.

But there were a few unexplained diseases—beri beri and scurvy, as two examples—that weirdly seemed to have something to do with diet. They knew, for example, that if you lived off white rice alone for 8 or 9 months, you could develop beri beri...but if you ate meat, or left the pericarp on the rice, that same beri beri could be cured. If you fed cows a ""bare minimum"" diet of pure protein, fat, and carbohydrates, they would go blind and their growth would be stunted. Scientists worked to figure out why these things were, but really didn't know what to make of this, and some of their hypotheses were *wild*...

...but eventually, several scientists figured out that these diseases were caused by a lack of something in the diet. Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis isolated a chemical ""factor A"" that rats and cows needed to avoid becoming blind and having their growth stunted. Polish biochemist Casimir Funk identified a separate [""vital amine""](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/history/Funk_1912.pdf) that the body needed to stave off beri beri. Funk specifically figured out that these ""vital amines"" (or vitamins, as we now call them) were chemical compounds that the body *needed,* but could not *manufacture*...something other than fat, protein, and carbohydrates.

So, in general, the small number of compounds we call ""vitamins"" today were only called ""vitamins"" because the body either could not manufacture them at all, or could not always manufacture enough of them. Vitamin D is a little special in that we *can* synthesize it, but modern humans that don't get enough sunlight often *don't* synthesize enough of it.

599,"Plate tectonics and earthquakes, which movement is most devastating?","> As a layman, I understand that earthquakes happen because of plate movement in the crust.

More of a terminology thing, but plates are blocks of [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) that are moving, where the lithosphere includes both the crust and a portion of the upper mantle. You are correct that earthquakes reflect plate movement, in short, as a whole plates move steadily (consider this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/) entry discussing drivers of plate motion), but largely because of friction, their edges (i.e., plate boundaries) typically display more ""stick-slip"" behavior. Meaning that they do (elastically) accumulate strain near the boundary but the boundary itself doesn't slip until the frictional strength of the fault is overcome, producing an earthquake when this threshold is reached (e.g., the [seismic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_cycle)).

> It is either plates are moving apart, or colliding, or moving under the other one (subduction).

There are three types of boundaries, but you're missing one of them. [Divergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_boundary) boundaries are where plates are moving apart, forming normal faults. [Convergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary) boundaries are where plates are colliding, forming reverse or thrust faults, but this effectively is the same as one plate moving under another. Subduction zones are one type of convergent boundary, whereas collisional boundaries between two continental portions of plates are not subduction zones, but still convergent. The one that you were missing was [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_fault) boundaries, where two plates are moving past each other and forming a strike-slip fault (e.g., the San Andreas).

> Which movement is most devastating for our cities?

There are going to be a lot of factors that play into whether a particular earthquake is damaging. The two most directly related to plate tectonics are the size (i.e., the magnitude) and the depth of the earthquake. Broadly, larger earthquakes that are shallow will have more intense shaking at the surface because earthquake waves attenuate with distance, so waves from shallow earthquakes will attenuate less before reaching the surface. Obviously then also the proximity of a given city to the epicenter of an earthquake is important. It is however worth mentioning that there are other geologic and non-geologic considerations for what makes an earthquake more damaging. For example the nature of the crust in the location of a particular city can either serve to additionally amplify or attenuate seismic waves depending on the details (i.e., [seismic site effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects)). In terms of damage that occurs, a huge consideration has nothing to do with geology, but is instead the type of construction and whether buildings were engineered with earthquakes in mind. This is generally why, even for largely identical earthquakes in terms of magnitude, depth, and distance to a particular city, countries with strict earthquake-minded building codes tend to have less loss of life than countries with non-existent or poorly enforced earthquake-minded building codes.

Ultimately though, your question really is **Which type of plate boundary produces the largest magnitude earthquakes?** A logical place to start is by asking what controls earthquake magnitude? Physically, we know that the size of an earthquake scales with the size of the area/length of a fault that ruptures during an earthquake (e.g., [Wells & Coppersmith, 1994](http://activetectonics.asu.edu/ActiveFaultingSeminar/Papers/Wells_and_Coppersmith_1994.pdf) - note, the magnitude scaling relationships here are a bit out of date, e.g., [Stirling et al., 2013](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/103/6/2993/331667/Selection-of-Earthquake-Scaling-Relationships-for), but they get the point across). Thus, plate boundaries that allow for larger continuous areas of a fault to rupture at once, can produce larger earthquakes. 

From the above, we can consider both along-strike (i.e., along the fault in a horizontal direction) continuity and the dip of the fault (i.e., the angle that the fault plane makes horizontal). The along-strike continuity is important because if individual fault segments tend to be short and mostly unlinked, then earthquake sizes are limited by the longest possible segment. The dip of the fault is important because stick-slip behavior (that produces earthquakes) is actually temperature dependent and when the temperature is too high, frictional processes no-longer dominate and faults tend to instead ""creep"", i.e., accumulate slow, continuous movement without earthquakes. This means that faults that have a shallow dip (i.e., make a small angle with respect to horizontal) tend to be able to support larger earthquakes because for the same fault along-strike length, there can be a greater area that is in the ""sweet-spot"" temperature wise for stick-slip behavior.

Finally, if we consider some general characteristics of the three types of faults, we can relate these back to earthquake size. From simple expectations (e.g., [Andersonian fault mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson%27s_Theory_of_Faulting)), we expect strike-slip (transform) faults to have nearly a vertical dip, normal (divergent) faults to have a high angle dip of ~60 degrees, and thrust (convergent) faults to have a low angle dip of <30 degrees. Additionally, what we observe is that normal faults tend to be very segmented, strike-slip faults can be pretty variable in terms of segmentation, and thrusts (especially subduction zones) tend to be able to support very long, continuous segments. If we put all of that together, generally, we expect that normal faults have kind of the lowest maximum possible earthquake sizes (short segments, high angle), strike-slip faults are kind of in the middle (longish segments, high angle), and thrust faults have the largest possible maximum magnitudes (long segments, shallow angle, greatest possible rupture areas).  This is why so-called ""great earthquakes"", i.e., those with magnitudes >9, exclusively happen on thrusts, and specifically subduction zones. That is not to say that either normal faults or strike-slip faults are not capable of producing damaging earthquakes, but we would not expect either of these types to support a M>=9 event.

**In short,** we expect convergent (thrust) boundaries to be able to support the largest magnitude earthquakes, with transform (strike-slip) second, and divergent (normal) to support the smallest maximum magnitudes. These are very general expectations and there are exceptions and all types can definitely produce earthquakes that are damaging (especially given local geologic and non-geologic consideration discussed in the longer answer above), but it is demonstrably true that the largest observed earthquakes have occurred on thrusts and this generally fits with our expectations of the physics and physical limitations of earthquake/fault behavior."
600,"Why is the concept of time different in space, and how does it affect astronauts' bodies and minds?","> Also, on a psychological level, do astronauts report feeling any different in their perception of time?

For you, time always passes at a rate of 1 second per second. What else could it be? Time dilation is only a thing if you compare your time to someone else. In principle you could see this in e.g. a call - but, as mentioned, the ISS is far too slow to make that noticeable."
601,When will earths magnetic field flip agian?,">I just learned that it has happened in the past, and it will happen again, but I'm curious as to when, since it seemed that they ""usually"" happens every 300k years and the last one was 780k years ago. Does that mean anything? Does it imply that another one can occur in the next let's say, 1-2 years? or does it mean that it wont ever again?

First off, if we take a look at (geologically) recent history of the orientation of the magnetic field e.g. [this diagram for the last 5 million years where black bars indicate a 'normal' field oriented like today, and white bars indicate a 'reversed' field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg) or a [similar diagram going back 170 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#/media/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_0-169_Ma.svg), we can see that the changes in the orientation of the magnetic field are definitely not periodic (e.g. the Cretaceous superchron normal period which lasted upwards of 40 million years). So, the premise that we are somehow overdue for a reversal is not really viable and similarly, nothing about the field at present suggests that it is in a fundamentally different state, i.e., we still expect a reversal will occur eventually. We would only expect magnetic field reversals to cease if the magnetic field itself completely collapses as field reversals appear to be intrinsic parts of geodynamos (i.e., the mechanism generating the magnetic field - see [this past discussion on AskScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ddmyk/according_to_the_theory_earths_magnetic_poles/)).

> Also, is there any way to predict the next one?

Not really. If you look through some of the links and/or discussion in the old linked thread, you'll find that generally this is a chaotic process and not easily predictable beyond saying that it will reverse at some point. From records of past reversals preserved in the remnant magnetic field within rocks, we know that reversals are preceded by periods of decaying magnetic field strength, and specifically the strength of the ""dipole"" component of the field. Given the observation that this dipole component has been [decreasing for ~300 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Geomagnetic_axial_dipole_strength.svg), there have been some suggestions that we might be approaching a reversal (e.g., [another old AskScience thread discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4b5zjt/by_how_much_is_the_earths_magnetic_field_decaying/)). However, at this point, the decrease could still be a [geomagnetic excursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_excursion) and we basically won't know until the field intensity decreases below a certain threshold (see the linked discussion for more details). Effectively, the jury is still out on whether we are really approaching a reversal (as opposed to an excursion), e.g., the [official position of the USGS is that we are not approaching a reversal](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-we-about-have-a-magnetic-reversal), which really just reflects that we can't know until it's basically already happening and there's no meaningful way to forecast when it will happen."

603,"During a viral infection, infectiousness reaches a peak and then declines. Is this solely attributable to declining viral load or are there other factors at play?","Yes, to some extent the drop-off in infectivity is greater than the drop-off of virus production. What can happen is that new virus can be produced and shed by infected cells, but the immune system can neutralize the virus before it can transmit to a new host.   In most cases this will be because of antibody binding to the newly-produced virus, but I think you’d get a similar effect in e.g. the APOBEC3-driven mutations seen in some infections. 

An example of antibodies neutralizing infectious virus is probably in COVID infections. It’s common for PCR or sensitive antigen testing to detect virus shedding for quite a long time after the infection starts, even though this virus is not infectious."
604,Can empirical evidence exist for specific selective pressures in evolution?,"I think it can only be empirically answered via experimental manipulation.

Below 16% oxygen, fires do not propagate. Above this, they can spread increasingly quickly and be more destructive with more oxygen.  So forest fires would be worse. A lot worse.  This is the fire window. 

Above 30% or so, earth would have to be much wetter than today, and oxygen levels stop mattering as much as moisture levels, so there is a control there. But any fire starting in dry material at 30% oxygen levels like they were in the past would spread incredibly quickly and capable of immense destruction."
608,How does taste work?,"There are different types of receptors within your taste buds that will react when they come into contact with different things. The exact details of which receptors are responsible for what, and how they get triggered seems to be an ongoing field of research, but on the level of perception, we are generally looking at 5 component flavors, sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami. These affect different receptors in the taste buds, which send different neural sensory information up to the brain. Spiciness is perceived through pain receptors that are largely separate from the standard flavor receptors. (I think, its been a while since I took the relevant class on this.

So in your example, if you have a salty flavor, the salty food is going to bind to the salt receptors. And if you have bitter flavor, the bitter component will bind to bitter receptors. And if you have both, each flavor gets picked up by it's relevant receptors. They aren't really competing with each other for receptors if the flavors are blended well. However, if you have a bitter leaf in salad that physically obstructs a number of your taste buds and therefor receptors, that would have a substantial influence on flavor, but it wouldn't be because bitter receptors are taking over the sweet, salty, sour, and umami receptors, its because the other parts of the food aren't physically reaching the taste buds."
609,"What is the difference between Critical, Supercritical, Prompt-Critical, and Prompt-Supercritical in nuclear physics?","Most of the neutrons emitted as a result of a fission reaction are emitted *promptly*, as a direct result of the fission reaction. However a small fraction of them (β) are emitted later, due to subsequent decays of the fission products. These are called *delayed* neutrons.

""Critical"" and ""supercritical"" just refer to whether the neutron population stays constant with time (critical), or grows exponentially (supercritical).

""Prompt critical"" is the point where the chain reaction can be sustained using the prompt neutrons alone (the delayed neutrons are ""extra"" at that point). That's important because the prompt neutrons are emitted on a much shorter timescale than the delayed neutrons, so the exponential growth of the neutron population can happen much faster.

610,How is cell fate determined? What determines placement of the epigenetic marks?,"Epigenetic marks are chemical modifications to DNA or histones. They are written or erased by enzymes that recognize particular DNA sequences, or the presence of other epigenetic marks.

Marks such as DNA methylation can be inherited from mother cell to daughter cell when cells divide. However, in mammals, the marks are extensively erased in primordial germ cells, the precursors to eggs and sperm. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals is  quite controversial. In my opinion, there may be a few extreme cases where it can happen, but it is quite overhyped. In other organisms (worms, plants, etc) this erasure doesn't happen and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance definitely exists.

Epigenetics is a quite complicated topic, and if you'd like to learn more, I've written about it here: https://denovo.substack.com/p/what-is-epigenetics

Now, cell fate is more than just epigenetics. Different cells express different RNAs and proteins, and this is regulated by things like transcription factors. ""How the body determines which cell becomes what"" is basically the entire field of developmental biology. I would suggest taking a look at a developmental biology textbook if you want to know more."
611,There have been 95 earthquakes in the Mt. Lassen area of Northern California in the last 7 days. What is the likelihood that there will be an eruption of Mt. Lassen?,"> Could this be a lead up to Mt. Lassen erupting?

Almost certainly not. While certain types of earthquakes and other seismic events (e.g., [harmonic tremors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_tremor)) can definitely be indicative of magma moving (and thus be useful signals in concert with other measurements we makes as part of [volcanic monitoring](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/comprehensive-monitoring-provides-timely-warnings-volcano-reawakening)) and in turn warn of *possible* eruptions, importantly; (1) tectonic earthquakes and volcanic earthquakes are relatively easy to distinguish from each other and (2) in this case, all of the seismicity in question are [aftershocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock) from the clearly tectonic [M5.5 event](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73886731/executive) that occurred on May 11, 2023. 

While it's understandable that folks in the area are worried, especially given blatant clickbait articles floating around suggesting a possible link between these earthquakes and an eruption of Lassen (which I won't link to, since they're unfounded nonsense), this particular 5.5 event (and thus the aftershocks it has produced) is clearly tectonic as opposed to volcanic (e.g., [this brief statement from the USGS](https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/1656811704406122496?s=20)). While it's obviously too recent for there to be much in the way of published work, there's plenty of good information out there on the tectonic context of this event and similar events (e.g., the M5.7 event that happened on effectively the same fault system in 2013).

625,"If vacuum is a poor conductor of heat, why do we still recieve heat from the sun?","There are three ways to [transfer heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer)- conduction, convection and radiation. 

[Conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) is the most ""straight forward"" version of heating- object 1 is in contact with object 2, and heat is transferred from the hot one to the cold one. Also, conduction is what heats an entire object if you're only applying heat to one place. You can think of the object as a bunch of different objects, all touching, and heat is conducted between them. How quickly and efficiently this happens is determined by the [thermal conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) of the material. 

[Convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_(heat_transfer\)) is the dominant form of heat transfer in fluids (fluids being liquids and gases, so inside the Earth's atmosphere, convection dominates), which is heat being taken from one place to another via a fluid. So for instance, as the Earth is warmed up, it is convection which transfers the heat to the atmosphere which then is transferred to you. 

You are correct that neither of these methods work between the Sun and Earth. But the third kind, [radiative heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation) works fine in a vacuum. That is the transfer of heat via thermal radiation- aka photons. Photons have no problem propagating through space, and thus the Sun is able to heat the Earth via that method. 

For the temperatures of most things on Earth, radiative heating is minor, so it's why using vacuum insulation (in something like a coffee mug) works so well. But for really hot objects (like the Sun) radiative heating works great."
626,Did the beginning of the latest Ice Age cause widespread extinction?,"The short answer is the end of the last glacial period is a bit unique within the Pleistocene (where the end of the last glacial period also represented the end of the Pleistocene) with respect to extinctions, i.e., most prior glacial-interglacial cycles (at either end, i.e., going from glacial to interglacial or interglacial to glacial) did not result in an extinction. It was in part this observation, i.e., that the extinction at the end of the Pleistocene killed off a variety of megafauna that had survived various glacial-interglacial cycles throughout the Pleistocene, led to the development of the ""overkill"" hypothesis, i.e., that since these megafauna had lived through prior glacial-interglacial cycles, a climatic trigger for the extinction was unlikely and that the coincidence of this with the spread of human populations might be related (e.g., [Steadman et al., 2005](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0502777102)). 

However, there are a variety of issues with the overkill hypothesis and more broadly it wasn't just megafauna that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene (e.g., [Jackson & Weng, 1999](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.96.24.13847)), no two glacial-interglacial cycles are exactly the same (e.g., [Meltzer, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2015032117)), and relatedly the way individual species respond via range shift etc. to climatic triggers varies and can either go well or badly (e.g., [Lister & Stuart, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631071308000928)).

627,"If a reflection hologram is recorded using coherent laser light, why do some areas appear out of focus?","I can't give you a complete answer, but one major contribution to the blurriness is from viewing the hologram with white light. The hologram was made using monochromatic (or nearly monochromatic) light. Since holograms like this one work on the principle of diffraction, and diffraction depends explicitly on the wavelength, you expect all features in the viewed hologram to be distorted when viewing it with polychromatic light. My intuition is that the scale of the holographic image is changing with wavelength, so you are effectively looking at many different images of different colors, each with a slightly different scaling, which smears edges and gives the edges a color gradient (this is clearly visible on the ropes)."

The elimination is based on apoptose of those cells. 
The screening for those high affinity receptors is done with proteins like AIRE (auto immune regulatory protein). Not all self-antigens are presented in the thymus, but it does indeed present a diverse array of self-antigens to educate developing T cells.

632,How was it determined what objects were “planets” before 2006?,"The original planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, could all be seen with the naked eye.

When you followed their path across the night sky, night after night, they seemed to take a different path than the stars. They were ""wandering stars"" - which, in Greek is ""asteres planetai.""

These were the planets for thousands of years. In the 1540s, we moved towards the idea of Earth actually being one of them - and all of them orbiting the sun.

As telescopes and mathematics were used to find Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, it was easy to just plop them onto the list.

But by 2006, we were finding tons of planet-like objects out near Pluto - as well as a bunch of planets around other stars. We needed a better definition. The old ""planet"" concept was no longer narrow enough. We'd have 100s, if not thousands of planets in our solar system if we kept with the old concept.

So it was agreed in 2006 to adjust the definition to three simple bullets.

Those studies are known as ""observational"", and as such are subject to what is known as ""confounding"" - what you think is an effect you are measuring is actually due to a confounder. 

For example, an effect that you think is due to diet might actually be due to socioeconomic class.

There are some advanced statistical techniques that can be used to tease away some of the effect of confounding, but there is often residual confounding that you can't get rid of because you either don't know about it or have no way to measure it. 

The case of smoking is a good one - we knew smoking caused cancer because the risk ratios - how big the effect was between smoking and not smoking - was so huge, on the order of 9 to 13 times more likely to get cancer if you smoked. 

That was big enough that the confounding essentially didn't matter. 

The problem with most of the observational studies published these days is that their risk ratios are small - a risk ratio of 1.5 would be large and I've seen many studies published with risk ratios of 1.2 or smaller. That's tiny, and frankly so small that the result is more likely to come from confounding than a real effect. 

If you look at those studies, they will say that something like ""drinking lots of soda is associated with obesity"" because observational studies are rarely strong enough to show causality. 

And then somebody writes an article that assumes that it's causal and sometimes the researches give press conferences that assume the same. It's sloppy, but it happens a lot. 

This is incidentally why results tend to jump around a lot. Eggs are bad, eggs are good, eggs are bad, eggs are good. 

The observational studies just aren't the right tool to answer questions like this."
634,What is the difference between a species and subspecies?,"The idea of a species is not cut and dry. The most common definition of a species is a set of animals that can breed and make fertile offspring. However, if you have asexual organisms or you’re looking at a fossil record this definition is not very useful. According to Wikipedia there are 26 different definitions of species concept in use, including definitions based on morphology, genetics, location, breeding patterns, and various other things.

635,How is Microcline (Triclinic crystal system) more Ordered than Sanidine (Monoclinic crystal system) in Order Disorder type Polymorphism?,Which one you get depends on the rate of crystallization. Microcline is found in very slow cooling silicic to intermediate plutonic rocks and some metamorphic rocks. Sanidine is the common K-feldspar in fast cooling silicic volcanic rocks. The slower cooling magmas that generate microcline allow for the development of more order within the feldspar’s crystal lattice.
636,Why mature RBCs in human don't get destroyed like other cells that lack nucleus?,"Loss of the nucleus in itself is not immediately lethal to the cell, especially if it has prepared for the loss. Apoptosis or other types of cell death involve many other pathways causing much more prompt damage, as well as recruiting phagocytes to finish the job. The calcium entry (and caspase activation) you mention notably does not occur in RBCs.

Another extreme situation is neutrophils literally expelling some or all of their chromatin (DNA + associated proteins) as sticky nets to trap bacteria. The neutrophils can sometimes survive that process."

In short the heat doesn't kill the pathogen, the immune system kills the pathogen and needs some extra heat to work more efficiently.

641,Why are there no natural caves at the Wieliczka Salt Mine?,"Large bodies of salt are slightly plastic under great pressure. Therefore, cavities in underground salt bodies tend to fill in over time. Here's some research on how fast it happens, citing 1% per year: [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3093924318ddf5d3f080466d8d87c568ab978cc8](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=3093924318ddf5d3f080466d8d87c568ab978cc8)

This is actually used to advantage in deep repositories for gases because the walls of salt cavern have very low permeability. Cracks tend to close, so the bulk salt body has very low pororosity. See  [https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/download/planning\_factsheets/mpf\_storage.pdf](https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/download/planning_factsheets/mpf_storage.pdf) for a general information sheet covering storage of many things in salt caverns.

It is also an advantage for geologic storage of nuclear material, where the expectation is that the salt surrounding the material will deform plastically over time, ensuring that the material remains sealed and is not subject to penetration by flowing ground water. See for example [https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1206/ML12068A057.pdf](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1206/ML12068A057.pdf)

The crystal caves mentioned in another answer are not caves in the bulk salt, so they form by different means and are more durable."
642,Can I drop a bug 50 stories without hurting it?,"Yes.

arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away. A rat is killed, 
a man is broken, a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement 
by the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an 
animal's length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a 
thousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in

Note though that this is not separation like oil and water. With oil and water the liquids would be modeled as strongly interacting and the dissimilar interactions create a distinct separation of phases. With gases, you can safely assume no interactions and treat each gas individually.

Scientists have several candidate species, but it seems like a safe assumption that it's another member of the same genus as the white-spotted pufferfish (*Torquigener*), as several species of *Torquigener* live in that exact area.

These nests are fairly recent discoveries...no one had reported a white-spotted pufferfish nest until 1995, and this new species' nests went unseen until 2018, when they were spotted 130km offshore during an oil field survey.

652,"Prior to the discovery of bacteria, how did people explain fermentation of bread, wine, beer, pickles, etc?","I know a little bit about this oddly because of studying the lore of alchemy.
___
**TL;DR**: We only need an explanation for fermentation via microbes because we assume everything is lifeless until proven otherwise, but ancient peoples didn't assume this. The way they understood the world assumed that everything was alive and imbued with spirit until proven otherwise, and the spontaneous fermentation or decay of foods appeared to them to be the evidence of this.
___
The Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim) who lived in the Renaissance period didn't think of fermentation as being carried out by organisms that were alive, but thought of living things as carrying out fermentation in their various organs. Digestion, the bodily functions, etc. were thought of as your organs all doing some kind of fermentation. Fermentation and distillation were cutting edge technology in those days, and just as analogies are made between our brains and computers nowadays, in his day, analogies were made between various human organs and bodily processes and fermentation. (With regards to some aspects of digestion, this wasn't too far off, since our guts have an entire microbiome that co-exists with us. Our gut microbiome literally ferments the fiber in our food to provide us with certain beneficial compounds like butyric acid and propionic acid, while others make us gassy, and make us fart out gases produced during their fermentation. It's not hard to see where the inspiration for this concept came from.) **EDIT**: For example, pregnancy was thought to be a fermentation process where the mother's womb fermented the semen of the father, thereby converting it into a baby. **/EDIT**

As far as I understand of his concept of what was going on, fermentation was a natural transmutation of substances: gases were produced from wet solids, and sugar was turned into alcohol, or in the case of lactic acid fermentation, sugars were turned into acids. All of this was mediated by a living substance, though they didn't necessarily understand the mechanism nor that there were individual cells of yeast or bacteria doing the work, or even mold in mold-fermented meats and cheeses such as salami or brie.

And the substances that did the fermenting inherited something from their ancestors, and separate ""cultures"" could thus be preserved in order to propagate fermentation with the qualities that they exhibited. In the human sense of the term, culture is what we inherit from our society that shapes how we do things and what sorts of things we do. This same term got applied to fermenting substances such as leaven because each lineage of yeast or starter dough or whatever continues to do what its ancestors did, each with its own 'cultural' characteristics, which we perceive as the flavors characteristic of each lineage of wine or beer yeast, or yogurt or cheese culture, or sour dough starter.

In the same way, our term 'spirits', in reference to alcohol, comes from this period's view of fermentation. When you ferment, the foaming bubbling ferment was referred to as the 'body' of the ferment. When you boiled it, you killed the 'body' (which would not ferment after being removed from boil, and was thus dead), and the vapors that came off of the boil were thought of as the 'spirit' of the ferment as it departed the dead body. This spirit was what they believed they were condensing when they distilled alcoholic ferments into hard liquor. This is why the term used to refer to distilled alcohols is 'spirits'. This is also why concentrated alcohol was referred to as [*aqua vitae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_vitae), the water of life, because it was believed the life of the ferment was captured in the distillate. And each type of thing you ferment had its own character, its 'spirit'/aether, which was thought to be the essence of the thing, just as a person's spirit was a sort of essence of the person. It was thought that this 'spirit'/aether of an animal or person or substance or thing was the 'fifth element', after the other four classical elements that were thought to compose all things—air, water, earth, and fire. That is why we have the term 'quintessence', coined by the French alchemist Jean de Roquetaillade. 'Quint' means five, and 'essence' means element. The quintessence of something was that thing that gave the substances of a thing its essential character—the 'spirit' of that thing. In alchemical lore, this was conflated with highly concentrated alcohol produced by repeated distillations. The alchemical way to capture quintessence is to do seven sequential distillations (usually of an alcoholic ferment), after which you would supposedly have the purest of the pure essence of the thing you're extracting. To this day, when you distill out the fragrances of plants, these distillates are referred to as 'essential oils', meaning the oils that contain the essence of a plant, its characteristic 'element'.

The world view that the world was full of interconnected life, and was imbued with spirit, even to substances like leaven and fermenting dough, is called [*anima mundi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi) (living world, world soul), and it informed the various ancient world views of the pre-scientific era. (And even today, you might be surprised at how many people operate with this world view. In Japan, a lot of people seem to operate under the *anima mundi* world view as part of the culture. For example, Marie Kondo thanking things for their service to pay respect before getting rid of them because they no longer spark joy when she tidies up the home of one of her clients is an example of viewing all things as alive and imbued with spirit, and therefore deserving of respect.)

You can see that yeast was recognized as a substance that grew and spread even in the way it is spoken of in the Bible, for example, [Matthew 13:33, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, Galatians 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A33%2C+1+Corinthians+5%3A6-8%2C+Galatians+5%3A9&version=CSB). But as far as I can discern, at least in Europe, where alchemy dominated the proto-scientific natural philosophy of the day had it that these substances carried out the processes of life, and were in some way ""alive"", and even had ""spirits"" in them."
653,Why does it take upwards of a minute or so for our eyes to totally adjust to light changes when our pupils constrict/dilate near instantly?,"Adjusting to darkness takes longer because the more sensitive rods have had their photopigments bleached (while less sensitive cones were taking care of vision).

The all-trans retinal generated when light is absorbed has to be recycled back into 11-cis retinal and incorporated into an opsin protein. This takes multiple reactions and in fact part of it happens in completely different cells, in the retinal pigmented epithelium. So it just takes a while for enough to be built back up after moving from light to dark conditions."
654,"If a quarry is left to fill up with water, how do fish get into the water?",There’s been evidence that fish eggs can stick to ducks or other water birds and get to new bodies of water that way. There can also be floods in heavy rain that carry fish from lakes and rivers into new bodies of water nearby.
655,I'm wondering if we have an understanding of what the potential upper and lower limits for size are for earth like planets?,We have a reasonable (if incomplete) idea of the upper size limits. see eg: [figure 3 in Chen & Kipping 2016](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/17/meta). The lower limits have not yet been fully explored because smaller planets are harder to find.

657,Would it be possible to clone the original dog from the dna in Canine transmissible venereal tumour?,"Some things that may come into play in this question:

>[On average, we found that cells accumulate 1.14 mutations per cell division in healthy haematopoiesis and 1.37 mutations per division in brain development. In both tissues, cell survival was maximal during early development. Analysis of 131 biopsies from 16 tumours showed 4 to 100 times increased mutation rates compared to healthy development and substantial inter-patient variation of cell survival/death rates.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7042311/)

If we were to wildly assume 1 cell division per day, for 6000 years, that would be 2,190,000 divisions. 

If we multiply 1.2 average mutations per cell division X 4-100 times the mutation rate in some cancer cells, X 2,190,000 divisions we would get somewhere from 10,512,000 - 262,800,000 mutations that have occurred since the original source dog. 

Dogs have about 20,000 genes made of about 3 billion base pairs. 

Again, this uses some pretty non-generalizable and wild assumptions, but it’s probably pretty safe to say that a big chunk of the original dog’s genome is just lost forever."
658,How do whales dive so deep and resurface without getting the bends?,"First, whales do get the bends.  During tests of high powered military sonar, whales have raced for the surface too quickly to get away from painfully loud sounds, later beached themselves and died, and autopsies have been consistent with decompression sickness or the bends.

It’s very difficult to get the bends from breath hold diving.  If you take a lungful of air at the surface and descend 100 feet, the pressure on your chest will compress your lungs to a fourth the size they were at the surface.  Even though the air in your lungs is pressurized and four times as much nitrogen could theoretically dissolve into your blood, there’s just not that much nitrogen available compared to the volume of your blood, so you never saturate nitrogen into your blood.  You’ll get more nitrogen into your blood than on the surface, but you’ll run out of nitrogen before your blood runs out of the ability to absorb nitrogen.  You have to ascend very, very quickly before that small amount of nitrogen comes out of solution quickly enough to cause the bends.  Unfortunately, some whales can swim upwards fast enough to count as “very, very quickly” and get the bends.

If you breathe pressurized air from a SCUBA tank while 100 feet down, each breath has four times as much nitrogen as a breath at the surface, and you can take multiple breaths.  The amount of nitrogen is no longer the limit. With every breath more and more nitrogen is added until you get to saturation after thousands of breaths.  With thousands of times more nitrogen dissolved in your blood, SCUBA divers have to ascend far more slowly than breath hold divers."
659,Why a rocket nozzle needs both a converging and diverging section?,"For a subsonic flow, reducing the area accelerates the flow. For a supersonic flow, increasing the area accelerates the flow. Hence the converging-diverging nozzle accelerates the exhaust up to Mach 1 in the converging section and beyond Mach 1 in the diverging section. Increasing exhaust velocity means increasing thrust with the same rate of propellant flow.

If you didn't have the converging section, the exhaust wouldn't reach Mach 1 and the diverging section would not have the desired effect.

Right before totality was achieved, the rainbow lost all its visible color except for hydrogen-alpha red…a deep red wavelength found among hydrogen spectral lines, briefly creating a very thin arc of only H-alpha red where the whole rainbow had just been.

662,How rare are non-Newtonian fluids in nature? What are some examples?,"If we don't restrict ourselves to the surface of the Earth, non-Newtonian fluids are not at all rare because it is broadly indicated through a variety of lines of evidence that substantial portions of at least the upper mantle are best described as a non-Newtonian fluid (e.g., [Post & Griggs, 1973](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.181.4106.1242), [Zhong & Gurnis, 1996](https://www.nature.com/articles/383245a0), [van den Berg & Yuen, 1996](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/96GL02065), [Giunchi & Spada, 2000](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000GL011460), [Billen & Hirth, 2005](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL023457), [Jadamec & Billen, 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09053), [Semple & Lenadric, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/961/5928551)) albeit a fluid with a *very high* viscosity (i.e., something in the range 10^(17) to 10^(20) Pa s). There's also been the suggestion that earlier in Earth's history, much more of the mantle actually behaved as a non-Newtonian fluid (e.g., [van den Berg et al., 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X9400246U)), whereas today it's generally thought that the lower mantle is better described as a Newtonian fluid. 

At surface conditions, but staying with geologic materials, many parts of lava flows are also best described as non-Newtonian fluids (e.g., [Pinkerton & Sparks, 1978](https://www.nature.com/articles/276383a0), [Griffiths, 2000](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.fluid.32.1.477), [Lavallée et al., 2007](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/35/9/843/129997/Non-Newtonian-rheological-law-for-highly)), but not all lava flows (and not all parts of individual flows) are non-Newtonian and the rheology of lava is pretty complicated and spans a suite of behaviors including brittle, plastic, and viscous (both linear and non-linear).

More broadly, I think this quote from [Balmforth & Craster, 2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45670-8_2) is quite relevant, ""The main motivation for this research activity is that, apart from some annoyingly common fluids such as air and water, virtually no fluid is actually Newtonian (that is, having a simple linear relation between stress and strain-rate characterized by a constant viscosity)."" In short, a lot of fluids are non-Newtonian (if only slightly), but I'll leave further discussion to folks who are likely more versed in fluid dynamics than I."

666,Can autoimmunity be conferred to breastfeeding offspring via autoantibodies in breast milk?,"Antibodies are proteins produced from B-cells, a subtype of white blood cells which originate in the bone marrow (hence the ""B"", for bone). They are relatively long-lived in the blood for proteins, having half-lives on the order of at most a few weeks. But, like all serum proteins, they are recycled and removed at a regular cadence. When antibodies are delivered into the body, without self-replicating cells to produce them constantly, their levels will decline to non-significant in a matter of months.

Breast milk contains mostly antibodies of class IgA which is mainly responsible for regulating immune response in mucosal membranes like the gut. This makes sense since we don't expect too much transfer of breastmilk antibodies into the bloodstream (if that happened, then drinking cow milk would put a ton of cow antibodies into our bloodstream and cause huge immune reactions leading to death). This class is usually not associated with autoimmune disease.

Breast milk also contains anti-idiotype antibodies which basically bind other already present antibodies to enhance immune response in neonates. This could lead toward hyperactive autoimmunity but for the most part because the  antibodies are transient and no memory mechanism forms for their continued expression (there are no B-cells in the child making the antibody that can become memory cells) it's unlikely that autoimmunity could be acquired.

In fact, some studies have shown that consumption of breastmilk as infant is associated with lower rates of autoimmune disease potentially because of the effects of the antibodies helping seed a healthy microbiome though more research is required to elucidate the correlation and mechanisms behind it. Here is a great [recent review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421002208) of our understanding behind the effects of breastmilk antibodies.

Please note that we certainly do not have a complete picture of breastmilk antibodies and most definitely are lacking in understanding of the mechanisms for the formation of many autoimmune disease. Exception exist to almost everything in biology, but for the most part it does not seem like there is an association between formation of autoimmune disease and the type/quantity of breastmilk antibodies ingested."
667,Why do satellites need to thrust to maintain orbit?,"The main reason is because the Earth's atmosphere doesn't just ""end"" at any place, but instead gets thinner and thinner the higher up you get (it can be described by an exponential decay function quite accurately, actually). 

Thus, all satellites orbiting the Earth will eventually need some station keeping, but the lower you are (like the ISS or Starlink) the more atmosphere there still is, and thus a little bit of drag slowing you down. 

At the altitude of the ISS, the atmosphere is about 3E-10% (or 0.0000000003%) as thick as it is at the surface of the Earth which is enough for the [ISS to lose about 100 m a day of altitude due to atmospheric drag, and thus has to be re-boosted periodically](https://www.esa.int/Education/Space_In_Bytes/ATV_a_very_special_delivery_-_Lesson_notes)."
668,How did life begin again sway?,"So much misunderstanding here it’s difficult to know where to start. Not all dinosaurs went extinct some evolved and survived. But when that event did happen life itself continued in a multitude of ways , the comet didn’t kill off ‘life’. We don’t have the same dinosaurs now but we do have dinosaurs in as much as we have birds. In the same we we have the descendants  of other creatures that lived at that time and don’t have descendants of those that dies out completely. This creators that were already well adapted to survive the changing environment they found themselves in or whose environment didn’t change so much will have had less pressure to change."
669,how does immunity work?,"Part of why this works is because the organic compounds in venom are macromolecules. They are large enough to have shapes specific to them and that do not exist anywhere in us so that we can identify them with antibodies but not suddenly develop autoimmune diseases. As organic molecules they are assembled using the same types of chemical bonds that most other biology uses, so we have the enzymes needed to break them down. 

  
With elements like the metals you listed, they aren't large and distinctive enough to be something our antibody system can work with. Or like zinc, and calcium, for example, they already exist in pretty substantial quantities in our bodies at all times and are absolutely essential for us to live. Many other trace elements are also vital for us to live. 

  
We also cannot break them down into something ""non-toxic,"" this is biochemistry not physics and we're not atom splitters, cool as that might be. So even if we had antibodies for certain metals they would just accumulate in our killer cells until those cells died and released all the metal again. Its better to just try to filter them out.

You might find this article on [innate and adaptive immune responses to snake bites](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141633/) interesting.

We have two main types of immunity. The innate typically recognizes damage to your body, physical injury, inflammation, or the like, and triggers a series of different cell types to ""do something about this problem right now!"" without ever really identifying what the problem is. 

The article has different sections describing how the cells in your outer and inner skin layers, as well as your mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and mast cells, are triggered into action by venom. That constitutes a lot of the main players in innate immune responses.

The adaptive immunity is the one in which your body makes antibodies which can provide you lifelong immunity to specific targets. Its typically what is needed to fight off viral and bacterial infections, and it can also be called into action by the presence of complex mixes of biologic foreign agents like those in venom. These are your T and B cells."
670,"What happens when two separate earthquakes occur simultaneously far enough apart, but close enough to a point that would feel both at the same time?","Are you asking if seismic waves can interfere with each other (in a [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference) sense)? Then, yes. While I'm not sure if there's a great reference for your specific question, there are plenty of references out there considering the interference of seismic waves, e.g., what is observed at the antipode (i.e., exact other side of the globe) of a given earthquake (e.g., [Rial & Corner, 1980](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB085iB05p02661)) or scenarios where different types of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave) from the same event interfere with each other (e.g., [Zhao et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926985110000601), [Shani-Kadmiel et al., 2012](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/102/4/1729/325455/Simulation-of-Seismic-Wave-Propagation-through)). For a hypothetical with two distinct sets of seismic waves from two different events interacting, the result will depend on the details of the waves, i.e., there might be constructive interference (i.e., the amplitude of the waves are enhanced) or destructive interference (i.e., the amplitude of the waves are diminished) depending on the offset in phase, amplitude, etc. Similarly, there would likely be complicated patterns as different types of seismic waves interact, e.g., the p-wave from one event interacting with the s-wave from another, and so on, as we see in terms of interference within suites of waves generated by single events (see the Zhao and Shani-Kadmiel papers referenced above). Given that, I would guess that there would be both constructive and destructive interference and that this would probably vary with time as the two sets of waves passed each other at a given point."
671,What is the oldest surviving mountain or mountain range?,"This isn't really a straightforward question to answer for a variety of reasons. Some of the challenges are that (1) dating the formation of topography in a meaningful sense is pretty challenging and (2) there can be ambiguity in the sense of a disconnect between the original tectonic events and the topography that exists today. There is also some overlap between these issues and you quickly end up in a variant of the ""Ship of Theseus"", i.e., when do we say the influences on topography of a mountain range are divorced enough from the original generative forces that this topography is unrelated to those original events?

For the first bit, there are certainly geologic indications of when topography begins to develop in a mountain range (i.e., sort of when the clock starts for us to start counting), e.g., when sedimentary deposits in basins next to the mountain range start to record increased rates of subsidence or the sedimentary character of the stratigraphy begins to change, etc. Working out details of topography from those and the history of duration of that topography is more challenging. There are also a variety of 'paleoaltimetry' techniques that allow us to estimate when areas achieved certain elevations, but these (1) typically have wide uncertainties, (2) require the right deposits to be preserved, (3) are often somewhat fragmentary records, and (4) are rarely preserved (and hard to interpret) in very old mountain ranges. Thus, what we are often left with is similar to your example, i.e., we can measure the age of rocks exposed in a mountain range, but tying that to the time of development of topography or the longevity of that topography is much more challenging.

That last point, i.e., the longevity of the topography brings us to point two. Even in cases where we have reasonable evidence that the age of rocks in a mountain range reflect (somewhere near) the beginning of topography formation, the extent to which the current topography reflects continuous existence of a mountain range in that location is not guaranteed. Take the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. The rocks there record a series of orogenic (mountain building events), the most recent one being the [Alleghanian Orogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleghanian_orogeny), which has variable timing, but we'll say occurred ~300 million years for simplicity. Does this mean that the topography of the Appalachians is 300 million years old? Well, not really, because there's been long-standing evidence that the Appalachians have effectively been eroded down and uplifted several times since then (e.g., [Poag & Sevon, 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0169555X89900093)). The current topography of the Appalachians is 'epiorogenic', i.e., unrelated to collisions of plates, and mostly likely reflects 'rejuvenation' of topography during the Miocene, so approximately 10 million years ago (e.g., [Gallen et al., 2013](https://rock.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/23/2/pdf/i1052-5173-23-2-4.pdf), [Miller et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X1300188X), [Liu, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2187), [Gallen, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X18302322), [Spotilla & Prince, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169555X22003427)). Similar epiorogenic histories of topography exist in other mountain ranges, e.g., the Rocky Mountains (e.g., [Eaton, 2008](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/4/5/764/31206/Epeirogeny-in-the-Southern-Rocky-Mountains-region)).

What both of these are meant to highlight is that there is sufficient ambiguity in what constitutes the topography of a mountain range today being the *same* topography as whenever the mountain range started to form that there's not a meaningful way to answer the question. Or at least, it's a pretty hard question to answer with any level of certainty."
672,Why can you determine rotation with 0 force acting?,"> By pure definition it's not accelerated

This is where your conclusion breaks down. Acceleration is described as a change in velocity, and rotating objects' velocity is changing (even if it's not speeding up, the direction is changing), so it is not an inertial frame."
673,What’s the difference between a colonial organism and a multicellular one?,"A colonial organism is a collection of individual cells that are capable of living independently, but have come together to form a larger, more complex structure. In contrast, a multicellular organism is composed of specialized cells that work together to carry out the functions of the organism.

In a colonial organism, the individual cells are often identical or nearly identical in structure and function. Each cell in the colony carries out its own basic life functions, such as metabolism and reproduction, but the colony as a whole does not have any specialized tissues or organs.

In a multicellular organism, the individual cells are specialized to perform specific functions, such as digestion, respiration, or movement. These cells are organized into tissues, which are in turn organized into organs, and these organs work together to carry out the overall functions of the organism.

Examples of colonial organisms include certain types of algae and bacteria, while examples of multicellular organisms include plants, animals, and fungi."

675,"If masses don’t affect the falling speed of objects, why is mass required to calculate the terminal velocity?","I feel this is one of those questions that comes up precisely because this concept is taught so poorly in schools. Teachers drill into our heads that ""mass doesn't impact falling speed"" and ""the acceleration due to gravity is the same regardless of the mass"" and neglect to teach the limitations of that statement. This is a bit of a tangent, but when I was a TA in college teaching a freshman physics class I would always start the semester asking a variation of this question, and the answers I got were all over the place, and quite wrong. But what I found interesting was that the answers I got were elaborate enough, that it seemed like these students had really thought about this question, but were not given the tools to tackle it.

So, the very short answer is ""air resistance."" Which, I'm sure you guessed had something to do with it. The full statement should be ""in a vacuum objects will fall at the same speed regardless of mass"" and that is very close to correct (we'll tackle why even that one is very close in a minute). And I do feel a lot of students have heard that, but even then didn't quite have the tools to answer it correctly. I saw a lot of students wrote things like ""they all fall at the same speed until they reach their terminal velocity"" or whatever, which still isn't true. 

So, we can tackle this with Newton's First Law, which says F = ma (applied force is equal to mass times acceleration). In a vacuum, the only force acting on a falling object, and if the object falling is much smaller than the object it's falling onto, and if it's falling from a height where the gravity doesn't change much over the distance of it's fall, then you can approximate the force of gravity to just be `mg`, where `g` is a constant (on Earth, about 9.8 m/s^(2)). 

So then, we can say `F = mg = ma`, and you see that the `m`s cancel, leaving `a = g`, the acceleration on an object is just equal to a constant, mass doesn't play a role. But of course this is only the case when the only force acting on the object is gravity. When something falls through the atmosphere, there is another force acting on it- drag (or air resistance). Actually calculating drag is a complicated process, but there are two things that matter for this discussion- the amount of drag an object undergoes depends on that object's cross-sectional area (the size of the object as viewed in the direction it is going), the shape of the object (for instance, pointy things have less drag than blunt things) and the speed of the object (the faster it goes, the more drag). Note, the mass of the object is not in here. 

This means that a balloon blown up to the same size as a bowling ball will feel the same drag force acting on it as a bowling ball when traveling at the same speed. But of course, the bowling ball will fall a lot faster. Why? Well, Newton's Second Law comes back to the rescue. 

So now, we can say `F = ma = mg - Fd` (`Fd`- the force of drag- is subtracted from `mg` since it is pointing in the opposite direction). So, since the force of drag is subtracted from the force of gravity, the fastest an object will accelerate is `g` since drag will always make it accelerate less. Also notice now that `m` doesn't cancel out. Instead `a = g - Fd/m`. And seeing this, we now have the equation that shows us how mass plays a role. `Fd/m` gets smaller when `Fd` gets smaller or `m` is larger. And for two objects where `Fd/m` is the same, they will fall at the same speed. So, now if we look at our balloon and bowling ball- the balloon and the bowling ball have the same `Fd` (same cross sectional area, same shape), but the bowling ball's mass is much bigger, so `Fd/m` is smaller, so the acceleration the bowling ball undergoes is closer to being just `g` than for the balloon. 

So, it's important to realize it's not just mass what matters- being heavier doesn't make you fall faster if your size increases as the same time, but all else being equal, it does help. 

You mentioned terminal velocity. Terminal velocity happens where acceleration is zero- that happens when `mg = Fd` (the force due to gravity equals the force due to drag). If you remember, the force of drag increases with speed. So, terminal velocity is just when the object speeds up to the point that this happens. One thing to note, normally we think of terminal velocity as ""starting from zero velocity, and speeding up until you reach this max velocity"" like a person jumping out of a plane. But if you start your decent with velocity (say, a bullet fired down out of a plane) the bullet will still reach terminal velocity (if it's up high enough), but instead it will be traveling faster and slow down to that speed. 

OK, and finally, coming back around to something I teased at the beginning- how even in a vacuum, a heavier object will fall ever so slightly faster than a light object. Now, I must warn you, this is such a small effect that you'd never notice it for anything reasonable, but it would play a role if say, the Moon was falling onto the Earth. When an object is falling to Earth, yes the Earth is tugging on the object, but actually the object is tugging on the Earth as well, and what may shock a lot of people- the object dropping actually pulls on the Earth with the exact same amount of force as the Earth is tugging on the object. So, if I drop a hammer on the Earth, the hammer applies the same force to the Earth as the Earth does the hammer- you can get this from Newton's Law of Gravity which says F = -G\*M\*m/r^(2) where `G` is a constant, and `M` and `m` are the masses of the two objects, and `r` is the distance between them. Note, the m's are treated the same, there isn't one that pulls and one that doesn't. So, as the hammer falls to Earth, the Earth also rises up to meet the hammer. But, since the mass of the Earth is so much bigger than the mass of the hammer, the acceleration of the Earth is so small, that it is completely and utterly immeasurable. But we know it must be there. But should something like the Moon fall on the Earth, well, that would actually be measurable. So, if you dropped a hammer and the Moon on the Earth, even in a complete vacuum, the Moon would impact the Earth faster."
676,"If you were in a sealed box moving near the speed of light, could you tell?","You are in that box right now.  The point is, you have to measure speed relative to something else and nobody is special.  That means you can decide you are stationary and some piece of a star tossed aside by the black hole in the center of the milky way is going near the speed of light.  OR the other way around: it's stationary and YOU are moving really fast relative to it.  If you start \*comparing\* things in your ""reference frame"" and that of the star stuff (like the length of rulers or light waves) then you can tell that you are moving relative to each other.  All this neglects acceleration, which makes things more complicated (general vs. special relativity).  Hope that helps."
677,How much of Earth's water was created after the Hadean period?,The discovery that there is as much or more water deep in the earth’s mantle than in the earth’s oceans a few years back throws into question the concept that earth’s water was almost entirely delivered by comets and asteroids during the Hadean period. It suggests a significant fraction of the earth’s water was intrinsically part of the planetesimals that fused to form the original Gaia body
678,Is there any evidence of Covid spreading well outside of Wuhan in 2019?,"The Italian wastewater sample is universally agreed to be a false positive. The Italian lab wasn’t able to replicate the findings, and we know that it’s very easy to get false positives with PCR, especially since the sample was tested at a time when there was very high COVID positivity. 

No one takes that report seriously today.

The genetic analysis of COVID very clearly shows that it arose around November to December of 2019:

>	Rather, the first zoonotic transmission likely occurred with lineage B viruses in late-November 2019 while the introduction of lineage A into humans likely occurred within weeks of the first event. Both strains were present at the market simultaneously.

>Researchers arrived at this conclusion by deciphering the evolutionary rate of viral genomes to deduce whether or not the two lineages diverged from a single common ancestor in humans. 

—[Coronavirus Jumped to Humans at Least Twice at Market in Wuhan, China](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/coronavirus-jumped-to-humans-at-least-twice-at-market-in-wuhan-china)

>	We show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted “A” and “B.” Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October to 8 December), and the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. **These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans before November 2019** and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported.

679,Can spiders take over other spiders webs?,"Generally they don't take over other spiders webs. Webs require too much maintenance and are sufficiently complex that it's not practical to take over.

However, there are plenty of different spiders that use other spiders webs. Everything from social spiders (who collaborate for various reasons), to kleptoparasites like Dewdrop spiders (that nest near orbweaver webs to steal food) to pirate spiders that use other spiders webs to lure them out and eat them."
680,Does sound travel faster in humid or dry air?,"Speed of sound for a material is (approximately, in the linear region of a material) sqrt(K/rho) where K is elastic stiffness and rho is material density*. This is _kind of_ intuitive, it's easier to push on a material to transfer momentum if it's lighter (less dense).

Humid air still approximately acts like an ideal gas and thus has an approximately the same number of molecules in a given volume. But now some of the molecules are light H2O molecules instead of heavier O2, N3, etc molecules. So humid air is less dense, and thus has higher sound speed.

*This is sort of a general result for a wave equation relating the wave velocity via a ""restoring force"" and ""inertial property"". You can replace K with a more specific term with individual parameters for an ideal gas, etc."
681,How do hair/fur covered animals make vitamin D?,"In the case of birds, they have an oil gland near the base of their tail that has vitamin D precursor in it. The birds use their preening oil to clean their feathers, and in the process the oil gets exposed to UV. The exposed uv gets incidentally consumed by the bird during the preening process. The UV light necessary for this process cannot pass through glass, so pet birds that are never allowed outside end up deficient in calcium because vitamin D is necessary for calcium utilization. A common symptom of calcium deficiency is feather plucking. So if you have an indoor bird that has a plucking problem, one possibility is that it needs direct sunlight. 15 minutes of direct sunlight per day is what vets recommend for birds."
682,Why are resting tremors and rigidity seen in Parkinson's Disease?,"What you're missing is that dopamine is only an exitatory neurotransmitter when it binds to D1-type receptors. When dopamine binds to D2-type receptors, it has an inhibitory effect. Among other regions, D2-type receptors are found in the external globus pallidus which projects to the basal ganglia and is part of how the brain controls movement. When dopamine levels drop, there is a loss of inhibition of unnecessary movement. This results in increased muscle tone (rigidity), tremors, and unwanted fine movements. 

The way the human body is able to achieve wildly different effects from just a handful of neurotransmitters by expressing different receptor types is such an elegant adaptation. Have fun in your studies."
683,"Chlamydia is cured by taking a single pill and waiting a week before engaging in sexual activity. If everyone on Earth took the chlamydia pill and kept it in their pants for a week, would we essentially eradicate chlamydia? Why or why not?","No. First of all, there is no single pill that current clinical guidelines recommend as a full treatment course for C. trachomatis infections. A single dose of 1g of azithromycin would be the closest thing we have, but that would typically consist of two 500mg pills, and is no longer a preferred course of therapy. The reason it's no longer preferred is that many bacteria (including C. trachomatis) have been developing increasing levels of resistance to the drug, and even when it was still preferred, it was never 100% effective. Even if everybody correctly took the full course of medication at the same time, the expected failure rate of (at minimum) \~2% would be more than enough to ensure the continued survival of the C. trachomatis species."
684,Scientists seem to agree that we begin to form memories around 2 or 2.5 years old. How in the heck is this studied? How can you tell if someone has real memories from that age?,"There are various ways. One of them is subjective tests - asking people directly when their earliest memory occurs. Oftentimes it's around this age. Now the issue with such tests is that memories are not stagnant. There's a process known as [reconsolidation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22877586/), where every time the memory is recalled it becomes malleable again. This means that the brain alters the memory - tweaks it, emphasizing details and under-emphasizing others, sometimes including things from the context in which you recall it. What occurs that over time the memory of a certain time is changed from what actually happened, and what you actually experienced. Parents or other older people telling you stories about you at that age can unintentionally be incorporated into the memory - create a false version of the memory if you will, and you think it actually happened or happened that way. 

There are also other processes that for smoothness of recall, mesh a bunch of memories together so that when you recall a general idea or a process, it becomes easier to remember. You don't remember every multiple choice test you've taken, but if someone sat you down right now to take one you know that you have to circle one choice, any strategies to select the best one, so forth. That's this process at play. So a memory of you as a young toddler might not correspond to that age, but could be a mesh of different experiences of your early childhood.

Other more direct testing occurs in the form of putting toddlers to the test to recall long term memories. Research in memory formation has been done since children are babies. They involve priming task - testing response to images that are either pre-exposed or represent something familiar. This gets better with age. Toddlers and older kids start recalling familiarity to stimuli from a certain age. Before that, whatever babies are exposed to doesn't really last long enough to be considered a conscious memory. 

Other tests - involving showing babies patterns and seeing if they are interested in the novel (what scientists expected they'd be more interested in) vs. the usual pre-exposed stimuli found that babies are more drawn to the novel stuff. Around 6-7 months they are able recall the difference between novel and usual stuff for weeks. Older babies (a year old) it lasts longer, and toddlers and children are able to recall the task for months. There are longitudinal studies that found that older people are able to recall exposure to things over years. The timeframe where this starts is around 3 years. This correlates with brain development in the temporal lobe at this point in  - important for memory formation and retention."
685,"The geomagnetic poles have wandered extensively during the last 10,000 years (Ohno & Hamano, 1992). What is the closest the magnetic pole has been to the geographic North Pole?","The geomagnetic poles have indeed wandered extensively during the last 10,000 years. However, I could not find a specific source that provides the precise information about the date and distance of the closest proximity between the magnetic and geographic North Poles during that period.  
  
The study by Ohno and Hamano (1992) is an important reference for the geomagnetic pole movement, but it does not provide the exact information you are looking for. The website you mentioned (poleshift.com) is not a scientific source, and its content should be taken with caution.  
  
In general, precise information about the geomagnetic poles' movements in the past can be challenging to obtain due to the limitations in our ability to reconstruct the Earth's magnetic field. The available data come from studying rocks, sediments, and ice cores, which provide a snapshot of the Earth's magnetic field at the time they were formed. The resolution of this data can be limited, and thus may not provide the exact date and distance of the closest proximity between the magnetic and geographic North Poles during the last 10,000 years.  
  
For more accurate and up-to-date information on this topic, you may want to consult scientific literature, such as articles published in peer-reviewed journals, or reach out to experts in the field of geomagnetism."
686,"How do human cells actually produce electricity, and how much of it?","You should expand your conception of electricity from what happens when it flows down a wire (which involves electrons skipping along the surface of the metal). In cells, there's an electrochemical gradient across a cell membrane (due to uneven concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl-, and a few other charged species) that gives rise to an electric potential (aka potential difference) across the membrane. This potential is typically around -70 mV to -40 mV for the resting membrane potential of a neuron, but it varies for other cell types."
687,Is there something beyond the Cosmic Microwave Background?,"The CMBR is a relic from the past. The surface of last scattering that emitted it doesn't exist anymore. We see it because light takes time to travel, so when we look far away, we will inevitably see it because it is an opaque plasma that lies at a specific time in the age of the universe. But that CMBR we are seeing has long since become galaxies and solar systems and planets. It's in the past of every part of the universe. What's ""beyond"" it is the time between recombination and the big bang, about 400,000 years worth of development of the universe that we can't see with electromagnetic evidence because the plasma was opaque during that time. 

It only looks like a ""shell"" around us because the speed of light is the same in every direction. It's a barrier of time, not space."
688,Are reptiles more susceptible to mutations?,"I assume you’re referring to two headed snakes, lizards with extra limbs, etc.
The answer is—probably!
Most of these mutations are caused by temperature fluctuations during embryonic development. Since most (all?) reptiles don’t participate in brooding behavior the temperature of their eggs is unregulated. Couple that with the fact that each time they lay eggs they go for a quantity over quality approach (compared to mammals) and you have a higher likelihood of mutants making it through development"

690,What diseases or issues in the body cause massive oxidative stress?,"Extreme exercise such as running a marathon is the most common example.  Aging is the next most common as your body increases production of things and decreases product of other things.

The primary sources of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body are mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled nitric oxide synthases and NADPH oxidase.

Things that get affected are DNA, lipids (including phospholipids), proteins and carbohydrates.  The ROS can have a direct function such as inhibiting a signalling enzyme (uh oh, messages aren't getting where they should) or non-specific damage in the local area (e.g. looks like you have an injury and the body needs to recover).

It has been known for decades that [ROS have a huge impact on cardiovascular health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3830063/#:~:text=Biomarkers%20of%20oxidative%20stress%20can,response%20to%20increased%20redox%20stress.).

691,How has the construction of hundreds of water reservoirs impacted the Texas climate over the last 60 years?,"This seems to be built on a variety of flawed premises, but we can break this into two bits, (1) Does the construction of reservoirs generally influence local to regional climate? and (2) How has climate in Texas changed over the period in question?

(1) Does the construction of reservoirs generally influence local to regional climate?

Yes, a bit, but not nearly as much as seems to be suggested here and also not necessarily in the direction assumed. There are a variety of studies looking at the effects of particular reservoirs, for example the reservoir created by the massive Three Gorges Dam, where work has suggested that this reservoir has a pretty minimal effect on local climate (e.g., [Wu et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212002972), [Li et al., 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029970)). More general work looking at the influence of reservoir construction specifically on precipitation has been equivocal in the sense of suggesting that it can lead to minor increases or decreases in precipitation depending on the local details (e.g., [Winchester et al., 2017](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/21/9/ei-d-16-0016.1.xml), [Zhao et al., 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac263c/meta)). Specific to Texas, there is work to suggest that the presence of reservoirs may enhance convective thunderstorm formation, but the effect of this basically limited to the reservoir itself (e.g., [Haberlie et al., 2015](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4461)). More generally, this question seems predicated on the common idea that simply impounding water in a location will lead to more precipitation in that location, which in turn assumes that water evaporated locally primarily falls as precipitation locally. In reality, the precipitation recycling ratio (i.e., the ratio of precipitation that comes from local evaporation) can be extremely variable and it is in no way a given that simply making more surface water available for evaporation in an area will dramatically increase local precipitation if the PRR is low, e.g., see this [prior discussion of PRR with respect to this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wp7y7v/how_the_us_weather_be_different_if_the_western/).

(2) How has climate in Texas changed over the period in question?

The analysis from [Gelca et al., 2014](https://twj-ojs-tdl.tdl.org/twj/article/view/7001/6100) spans much of the time period of interest and highlights that there have been some changes in the variability/intensity and seasonality of precipitation, but not much change in terms of average annual totals. The changes observed are related more to (global) climate change and not the (local) construction of reservoirs. More broadly, I'm not sure there's much veracity to the idea that the arid portions of Texas are somehow no longer arid. Looking to the future, if anything, aridity is expected to increase, not decrease (e.g., [Neilsen-Gammon et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EF001552))."
692,Upto how much depth we can detect ground water ? What is latest tech available for it ?,"The traditional way of establishing the location of groundwater is through drilling test wells based on understanding gained from surface features (e.g., [this explainer from the USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-do-hydrologists-locate-groundwater)). There are however increasing applications of a variety of geophysical methods for locating groundwater, some of which that do not require wells (though this will definitely improve the data). [Binley et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015WR017016) provides a summary of some of these methods including; a variety of electromagnetic survey techniques (e.g., resistivity, potential, induction, etc.), ground penetrating radar, seismic surveys, and gravity surveys. In terms of depth, most of these are restricted to the relatively shallow surface (<10-15 meters) unless they are being applied down a borehole. Of the methods Binley highlight, only [time-domain electromagnetic surveys (TDEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_electromagnetics) are potentially able to detect groundwater at depths of ~100 meters (e.g., Figure 5 in Binley) depending on the power of the transmitter / size of the receiver. So the short answer is that what they're claiming is certainly possible, but depends on what methods they're using and the quality of the data they're promising (assuming they're indicating they would do this assay without any boreholes vs boreholes guided by something like TDEM results from an aerial survey)."
693,"Do people with widely set eyes (ex. actress Anya Taylor-Joy) have a different or deeper sense of depth perception, than those with closely set eyes (ex. actor Vincent Schiavelli)?","People with different IPDs (Inter pupillary distance, between 50mm-80mm) will have effectively the same view until you get up close and personal.

When focused at infinity, our eyes look straight ahead and the field of view overlap occurs around 60° due to the nose obstruction and nose bridge protrusion. Moving the eyes apart changes where that overlap starts to occur, but the sightlines are still parallel. 

The reason it doesn’t make more of a difference is because the angles of convergence (When you move your eyes inward to focus on an object) are very small, less that 1° per eye, until you get to within a 2 meters in front of you."

695,"In birds, is bright coloring tied to better fitness somehow, and why doesn't it result in more predation?","Well there's more going on there.

Selection occurs both in surviving and attracting a mate to pass on the survival genes

Some animals evolve bright colors indicating poison or at least distasteful to the predator. Think brightly colored caterpillars etc. And so, sometimes that means less predation

And, then, bright colors, especially if concealable and shown for mating, make a male more attractive to the female. And, (speculating) if a brightly lit male can survive, it's more attractive to the female too. 

And the camouflage, hiding from predators while sitting a nest, while males may be more successful finding mates and risking predation 

So trade offs, right? Brightly colored = more attractive, so mates more. And, maybe indicates distasteful = less predation, so mates more.

697,Has the refractive index of the atmosphere at sea level changed over the last 100-200 years due to greenhouse gasses?,Generally speaking the refractive index is different based on your geographic location.  Radar manufacturers will publish a book that has refractive indexes for different locations.  I don't know how often they conduct their surveys to determine refractive indexes.
698,What advantages does the Hubble Space Telescope have over a ground based telescope with modern adaptive optics?,"> no similar concerns about weight 

I'll stop you right there- this certainly is not true.  Any idea how heavy a mirror is that's a piece of glass several meters wide, not to mention the mount to hold it and the instrument to mount on the back (which is not small)?!  Plus thermal issues are indeed still a problem- lots of cooling with liquid helium has to happen to minimize thermal noise on these instruments.

In fact, the stability of space telescopes is also unparalleled compared to ground telescopes that have to deal with: weather, atmosphere, rain, dusty mirrors, people with flashlights, cars, etc.  Trust me, my colleagues and I would gladly take HST's thermal background noise over Arizona's background weather any day!

To answer your question, there are a few things to consider here:  

1) Even with adaptive optics, the water vapor in the atmosphere will still absorb quite a bit of information towards the UV and infrared parts of the spectrum, both of which HST covers a portion of (not as much as JWST in infrared, of course, but it's still great at this).  Also, some wavelengths are particularly high noise due to the atmosphere- we call this ""high background.""  HST obviously doesn't have an issue with either of these.

2) Adaptive optics limits you in field of view- it works great for one target at the center of your detector, but not really for wider fields of view- HST on the other hand has a few arcminute wide FOV, and you don't need to do any corrections.  So, for example, if you're interested in mapping a patch of sky to very deep precision, to look for Kuiper Belt Objects or a faint galaxy a radio signal might have originated from, HST is the way to go.

3) Adaptive optics systems for the most part work in the infrared part of the spectrum these days, not optical. So they don't actually replace HST as much as you'd think!

4) AO systems are rare, almost as rare as space telescopes- they are expensive- and not all are equally open to the astronomical community. (Keck on Mauna Kea, for example, is an amazing facility but is managed by the California Association for Research in Astronomy, so unless you're a California astronomer/ have a collaborator there you're not really gonna get time on it.) On the other hand, HST is an open skies facility, where anyone in the world can apply to use it.  The annual deadline is actually coming up later this month, and several times more hours will be requested than there are hours to give.

Ultimately though, you're right, we wouldn't build another HST exactly as it is now because our technology has gotten so much better. (It's a general rule that by the time anything goes into space, it's somewhat obsolete technology due to all the tech involved to make it.) But that certainly doesn't mean it isn't super useful, both because of the reasons listed above and because we've already paid to build it, and it's a fantastic instrument (and it's expensive to build new telescopes, on ground or in space)."

How do outcomes compare to public, private, or charter schools?","Generally the only studies I have ever seen about this are from the National Home Education Research Institute, which is quite publicly pro-homeschooling.  [https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/)

  
According to these studies homeschool students generally do better on standardized tests and have higher college graduation rates.  But this is messy in the US, states all have different rules on what homeschooling is.  Some students are only partially homeschooled.  Some states like Florida have loads of rules about homeschooling, others like New Jersey, parents don't even have to officially acknowledge it.

Basically the researchers had volunteers from different cities navigate themselves in a game, and then compare the results to the ""entropy"" of their hometown. If you grow up in most cities in the states, you will find it hard to navigate in a messy map. People with the best performance in this game grew up outside large cities."

703,Does the adaptive immunity always kick in or only when the innate immunity can't take care of the germ?,"The adaptive immunity only kicks in when the innate immunity is unable to eliminate the pathogen. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against pathogens and works to contain and eliminate the infection. However, if the innate immune response is insufficient to control the infection, then the adaptive immune system is activated. The adaptive immune system is more specific and can target the pathogen with a high degree of precision, but it takes time to develop a response. Therefore, the adaptive immune response is typically slower to kick in than the innate immune response."
704,"In a turbofan engine, what provides the thrust?","That's a great couple of questions. First, though, I need to clear something up: there is no ""explosion"" in the burner can of a jet engine. 

Think of a jet as a tube shaped a little like an hourglass turned on its side, but open at both ends. In the front of the engine is a set of fans, called compressors, that push intake air down into the narrowing tube (toward the middle of the hourglass). As this air moves toward the narrow middle of the engine, it is forced into a smaller and smaller space. This does several things: increases its pressure, velocity, and its temperature. 

When it reaches the narrow midsection of the engine, fuel (kerosene, usually) is sprayed into the moving air. If the engine is just starting up, a type of spark plug is used to ignite the fuel mixture. (If the engine is already running, there is fire in the burner can, so the igniter plugs are not needed.)

As the fuel mixture burns, its temperature increases. As it does, it expands. It is now moving through an ever-widening tube, and the expansion keeps it moving (even helping push it along faster). 

At the end of the tube is a turbine that looks very much like a fan. Instead of pushing the air, though, the turbine is pushed BY the air (exhaust gasses). 

The turbine is connected by a shaft to the compressor fan in the front, and it keeps the compressor spinning, so the combustion process is continuous. 

That's how the burning process works. To answer your question about ""What provides the thrust?"", it depends on the engine. In a pure turbojet, the thrust comes from the pressure of the exhaust gasses as they leave the burner can and, later, the engine. 

In a turbofan (which is what you asked about), the compressor blades are MUCH larger than the burner can, and push far more air into the engine housing than is needed for combustion. The extra air is simply directed (or ""bypassed"") around the burner can, blending with the exhaust on the way out the back. BUT this ""bypass air"" is being pushed by the compressor fan, just like what the propeller on a prop plane does, so it provides substantial thrust, too. 

You can tell by looking at jet engines what kind they are. Pure turbojets are very narrow, kind of like a big metal cigar. Early turbofans are larger, the clue being that the fan in the front of the housing is much larger than the exhaust tube in the back. 

There are also so-called high-bypass turbofans, like on newer Boeing and Airbus planes that direct 75-80% of their intake air around the burner. Propellers are very efficient at moving aircraft, so these high-bypass engines produce most of their thrust from the bypass air, and are much more efficient than pure turbojets.

I hope this helps! Cheers!"
705,How does the immune system struggle to fight off certain bacterial infections?,"You are mostly correct, but it depends on the human that hosts the immune system. They have different performance person to person, and some people may not be able to overcome the evolutions these species develop.

What makes MRSA particularly dangerous is its ability to colonize in the human body without causing symptoms, making it difficult to detect and control. MRSA can spread easily in hospitals and other healthcare settings, and can also be transmitted in the community through close contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects. MRSA infections can also be difficult to treat due to the limited availability of effective antibiotics, which can lead to longer hospital stays and increased risk of complications.

C Diff is often contracted in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and long-term care facilities. C. diff is particularly dangerous because it can produce spores that can survive in the environment for long periods of time, making it difficult to control its spread. Some strains of C. diff have become resistant to certain antibiotics, which can make it difficult to treat.

Probably because of how susceptible these two species are to hospital transmission, is why we see so many people with pre-existing immune deficiencies contracting it and giving it a bolstered reputation. These two can be highly resistant to antibiotics, so if your immune system is already struggling, you're going to have a rough time."
706,"This is more of an engineering question, but what do power plants do with their extra energy?","This is what makes an AC system better than a DC system. The AC system automatically contains the information needed to know how much energy you need to produce in every given moment: simply hold the frequency.

The frequency is a function of the number of magnetic poles and RPM of the rotor in the generator.
Imagine a simple magnet with one N and S pole each. It needs to rotate at 3000 RPM to maintain 50 Hz (yes, I'm in Europe). Double the amount of poles and 1500 RPM is needed and so on.

When the load increases it becomes ""harder"" for the generator to rotate, the RPM and the frequency decreases. Then you need to add another generator to the system.
The frequency might drop for a short while but this is then compensated by increasing it for a short while.

To be able to maintain a stable net, actual physical inertia is needed. This lies in the large generators at big power plants.
When increasing the amount of unstable sources, such as small wind turbines or, even worse, electronically controlled inverters, usually used in small residential solar panel installments, the stability decreases."
707,How does water erosion form spires in Canyons?,"The key to differential erosion (i.e., erosion at different rates, whether that's by water in a river or through hillslope processes, etc.) is typically contrasts in the erodibility of material. The most common example is contrasts between different sedimentary rock layers, this is why canyons formed in layered rocks tend to be stair-stepped, where harder, more resistant rocks tend to form steeper cliffs than the the softer, less resistant rocks. While contrasts between layers is not going to help us explain a vertical spire (or a pinnacle as it is sometimes called), differential erosion still might. Here though we need to consider that there are other aspects of rocks that can influence their erodibility besides just the rock type. One of those can be the presence of fractures, i.e., cracks, that because they can be a pathway for fluids, tend to be zones where weathering and then erosion is a bit more efficient. It's pretty common for there to be sets of cracks in rocks at the surface (e.g., [sets of joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_%28geology%29)), so one likely possibility is that there was a set of vertical joints that were exploited and allowed for differential erosion around the ""core"" of what is now the spire. This process is also thought to be the main way that [hoodoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_%28geology%29) form. While there might be other ways to form this pinnacle (e.g., just a remnant left behind from the way the river network was organized with the pinnacle being originally part of an ""interfluve"" that was isolated via stream capture, etc.), exploitation of weak, vertical fractures would be my go to answer."
708,How is the distance an animal can smell calculated?,"Good questions. I cannot imagine how the 18 miles for polar bears scenting an odor was calculated.

From a literature view that I did some years ago, it seems that the smelly molecules basically move on the breeze. They get diluted and moved mainly by air currents and turbulence. See [here](https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/31/2/155/285981?login=false) for how male moths find their females by tracking the plumes of perfume that they emit upwind to their source. 

A quick hunt on Google scholar came up with ""Windscapes and olfactory foraging in a large carnivore"" (2016) (open access), which is about how polar bears sniff out their prey and agrees with my point of view.

As you say the odor will eventually be too dilute to detect, so chemicals that are meant to be detected (like the female' moths perfume) have evolved to be detected by their targets at incredibly low concentrations."
709,"What is the reproductive strategy employed by flowering plants that bloom only one day or night per year, or even more infrequently than that?","This post is written as if the queen of the night flower produces one flower on one night each year. This is not the case; while individual flowers last only one night, a single plant can produce multiple flowers per year, which may or may not bloom on the same night. 

Others have made some good general points, but I will add some specifics for this plant:

Being a cactus, maintaining an open flower during the day is very expensive in terms of energy and water. Moths and bats are its prime pollinators, and they can be attracted from quite a distance away-- you will almost certainly smell the flower before you see it."
710,Are there any biomes that used to exist on earth but don't anymore?,"Yes, due to very different climate conditions and thes species types.

712,What happens to a planet when it’s absorbed by its star?,"When a star absorbs a planet, it usually happens due to the planet's orbit decaying over time, leading it to move closer to the star. The process of a star absorbing a planet can be broken down into several steps:  
  
The planet enters the star's Roche limit: The Roche limit is the point at which tidal forces from the star become stronger than the planet's own gravitational forces. When a planet enters the Roche limit, it starts to experience tidal forces that can cause it to break apart.  
  
The planet is tidally disrupted: As the planet approaches the star, the tidal forces exerted by the star become stronger, causing the planet to become elongated and eventually break apart. This process is known as tidal disruption.  
  
The planet's material is heated: As the planet's material is tidally disrupted, it starts to heat up due to frictional forces. This can cause the planet's material to ionize and emit radiation.  
  
The planet's material falls towards the star: The material that was once part of the planet now starts to fall towards the star due to the star's gravity. As the material falls towards the star, it heats up even further and can start to emit X-rays and other high-energy radiation.  
  
The material accretes onto the star: The material from the planet eventually reaches the star and is accreted onto its surface. The accretion process can cause the star's brightness to increase temporarily due to the additional energy being released.  
  
The remnants of the planet may form a debris disk: After the planet has been absorbed by the star, the remaining debris can form a disk around the star. This debris disk can sometimes be observed using telescopes and can provide insight into the planet's composition and structure.  
  
The process of a star absorbing a planet is a violent and destructive event that can have a significant impact on the star's properties and surrounding environment."
713,"Does dark matter behave in any way like a gas, dust, or plasma, and if so, are there dark matter nebulae?","To the extent that ""nebula"" means a cloud of diffuse material, there are dark matter nebulae. We call them ""[halos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo)"", because they are known to surround galaxies. However, halos are also expected to exist that are smaller than galaxies and do not contain any visible matter. Small halos can also exist inside larger ones. [Here's a classic picture](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/aquarius/Aq-A-1-114_6144x4608.jpg) of what a dark matter halo would look like that's comparable to the halo of our own galaxy, if dark matter were luminous. The host halo occupies basically the whole picture, and each of the points are smaller halos inside it.

There are several important differences between a dark matter halo and a gaseous cloud, though. Gases have frequent short-range particle-particle interactions, which enable phenomena like pressure, sound, and heat transfer. Dark matter does not have nongravitational interactions -- or if it does, they are very weak. Consequently, dark matter halos are not supported against gravity by any pressure. Instead, they are supported against collapse by the orbits of the constituent particles, which are generally oriented in random directions.

Also, gases of ordinary matter can shed orbital energy by converting it into light. This allows gas clouds to condense into galaxies, stars, and such. Dark matter cannot efficiently shed its orbital energy, so it remains in diffuse halos."

715,How do invasive species manage to propagate in an area without severe inbreeding?,"They don't. Invasive species are often highly inbred.

Inbreeding isn't a magical death ray. Sometimes inbreeding is really bad. Sometimes it's not so bad. There are conditions that can make some populations relatively resistant to inbreeding-related problems (for example, flushing recessives due to long-standing, mild inbreeding). 

>However, it has been suggested that a population can be purged of the genetic load responsible for reduced fitness when subjected to bottlenecks...Following the founder-flush phase, the isofemale lines, with a large flush size and a history of inbreeding depression, recovered most of the fitness lost from early inbreeding, consistent with purging. 

--[Purging of inbreeding depression and fitness decline in bottlenecked populations of Drosophila melanogaster](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00303.x)

Or, the invasive species may suffer from inbreeding depression, but the benefits of a new low-competition environment may outweigh the problems, and the invaders adapt. 

>Specifically, we suggest that a temporary or permanent release from stress in invaded habitats may alleviate the negative effects of genetic depletion on fitness via I × E interactions, and present published empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis. We additionally discuss that I × E interactions can result in rapid evolutionary changes, and may even contribute to adaptation of invaders in the absence of high genetic variation

--[The Genetic Paradox of Invasions revisited: the potential role of inbreeding × environment interactions in invasion success](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12263)

Or, the inbreeding depression may be purged as the invasive species spreads. 

> However, under certain theoretical conditions, bottlenecks of intermediate size can actually purge the alleles that cause inbreeding depression.... Thus, rather than posing a barrier to invasion as often assumed, bottlenecks, by purging deleterious alleles, can enable the evolution of invaders that maintain high fitness even when inbred.

--[Inbreeding depression is purged in the invasive insect Harmonia axyridis](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(11\)00124-2)

And of course, we mainly see the small number of successful invaders. It's very likely that there are many failed invasions that we never notice, because the inbreeding depression prevented a successful new population."
716,How does cellular ion channels let the proper ion through ?,"This is an area of research that has been pretty well studied. In fact multiple crystal structures of ion channel's-particularly potassium channels have been resolved which include the capture of ions in transit through the channel. This revealed which amino acids were involved in that thansit and importantly the role of water as a hydration shell around each ion which provides the size component for ion selectivity. 
For detailed explanations the primary literature is rife with examples. Search for ""selectivity filters."" 
Another level of selectivity is the permeability ratio each channel has for different ions. Potassium channels can conduct other ions including sodium, but the permeability is sufficiently slow that when is potassium is around it preferentially passes through. In controlled research settings where the ions around a channel can be controlled 100% you can measure this differential in permeability."
717,Are ultra marathon or high volume exercise athletes more prone to cancer?,"I'm not sure that elite endurance athletes have a substantially higher rate of cell turnover than others. They do put themselves under greater stress which increases some cellular turnover (like red blood cells) but I would imagine that infections, autoimmune diseases (like lupus), or other stressors like regular alcohol usage would also induce higher cellular turnover. I couldn't find a good way to compare these and I'm not even sure that the studies exist. If they do, I'd love for someone to post more information about it!

What we do know is that more physical exercise results in less cancer. This has been shown in quite a few studies and is well accepted. Generally aerobic exercise is considered the best for cancer reduction though resistance training (IE weight lifting) also provides a benefit. 

There is some concern for elite athletes having a higher risk for cancer. Not because of increased cell turnover, but rather increased reactive oxygen species from increased oxygen consumption. There have been quite a few studies looking at elite triathletes and DNA damage and they found no lasting DNA damage, potentially due to increased antioxidant production.

720,How does the human body create energy?,"The human body does not generate any energy de novo. The human body converts chemical energy stored in the food we eat into usable energy through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. 

Essentially, the food you eat is digested down to base components and eventually converted to the sugar glucose. Glucose goes through a process called the Krebs cycle and is slowly broken down. The energy stored in the chemical bonds of the glucose molecule is used to charge up specific transport molecules which are used by the mitochondria to convert electrical potential energy into a high-energy chemical bond in the form of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate). The phosphate bond is the high energy bond that essentially all living things have evolved to use to power energetically expensive biochemical reactions. This occurs most efficiently in the presence of oxygen as a final electron acceptor. In the absence of oxygen anaerobic metabolism pushes you more toward pyruvate with lactate 
/lactic acid as a byproduct. 

Other molecules can be metabolized such as fatty acids but the breakdown byproducts can also result in acidosis. 

Please note this is an extremely pared down explanation of the glycolysis process. There are many steps and regulatory signals involved. But the end result is glucose is broken down and the energy stored in the bonds of the glucose molecule are used to create ATP which the body uses as an energy currency."
721,"If the body produces more melanin when exposed to UV rays, would being in a dark environment lighten the color of your iris?","Darkness won't make your brown eyes blue.

Skin is constantly renewing itself. It turns brown in the sun but that skin flakes off and six months later you're cracker-white again. 

The iris and things attached to it have very slow metabolism, and epithelial cells containing melanin don't usually slough off unless there's friction or a pigment dispersion syndrome. And then you can see little melanocytes floating up and down in the anterior chamber convection currents. They don't disappear. Loose melanocytes and any inflammatory cells eventually accumulate here and there and even clog up the drain causing glaucoma.

Eyes are sometimes born lighter and develop more melanin. But it rarely goes the other way.. when you see color change from brown to lighter colors in the human iris, it's usually a pathological process. The idea that iris color changes morning to evening or in any other cyclic fashion would be unsupported by evidence. *Apparent* color is influenced by illumination, background, and subjective naming."
722,"Why have COVID cases declined, and seem to continue staying low?","Actually, if you look at wastewater signals in a lot of areas, the numbers are still running relatively ""high.""  The big difference repeat infections will usually be less severe than first time. It is still circulating, but the effects are much less on individuals. Add to that many vaccinated persons, etc. and it had run its course.  It will continue to circulate far into the future, but will act like other coronaviruses that currently circulate."
723,What makes rabies so deadly?,"So basically rabies travels into the spinal column and up into the brain, where it then multiplies. Once this multiplication has begun it can’t be stopped, so eventually the person just succumbs to the neurological degeneration. The brain gets so messed up it can’t maintain regular bodily functions and such. What makes it so bad is the viral replication in the brain that can’t be treated."
724,How do deciduous trees know that it’s actually autumn and not just an extended cold snap in April or May and start changing color and dropping leaves?,"Plants don't all take the same cues for the seasons; there are a handful of signals they use and they can use them differently. Day length (""photoperiod"" in the scientific literature) is the big one, but temperature (""vernalization""), amount of light (as opposed to duration of light), and amount of water or nutrients are also signals that some plants use to decide when to flower or other seasonal changes."
725,Why is Taq polymerase inactive at very high temperatures even though it is not denatured?,"The enzyme maintaining its an active conformation is only one component required for successful DNA polymerization. The other is the presence of double-stranded DNA with a recessed, free 3’ end. (like a primer bound to a single-stranded template). At those temperatures, at least under PCR conditions, the DNA isn’t in the proper configuration.

It should also be noted that every cycle up above 90C, some of the Taq in the reaction does irreversibly denature, with both the temperature and hold time contributing to the extent to which this occurs. Each cycle, less and less will be active when the temperature drops again."
726,How are we able to date EVERY fossil with radiometric dating?,"In short, we are not and it's actually relatively rare that we date fossils directly in the sense of getting an absolute age on the fossil material itself, specifically because (A) fossils do not tend to be composed of material that lends itself well to radiometric dating or (B) the fossilization process does not ""reset"" isotope systematics such that a radiometric date would be meaningful. Exceptions would be dating things through [radiocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating), [amino acid racemization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid_dating), or [U-series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93thorium_dating), but these are all relatively limited in terms of how far back we can date materials and/or when these dates are meaningful for the age of the fossil. Instead, establishing ages of fossils largely fall into one of three categories: 

1. Dating the rocks in which the fossil is hosted. Since most fossils are hosted in sedimentary rocks, this poses its own challenges as many sedimentary rocks are hard to radiometrically date. There are some methods that allow us to constrain the ages of these however. For example, for sandstones, it's common to estimate the maximum depositional age (MDA) via detrital zircon U-Pb dating. In short, you date a bunch of zircons within a sandstone sample via U-Pb and the youngest age population in that suite of ages is the maximum age permissible for the sediment to be deposited. With respect to your mentioning of things like uranium being relatively rare, this is generally true, but there are minerals (like zircon) where these ""trace elements"" tend to partition during igneous processes. So even while uranium is a pretty small component of your average zircon, there is enough for us to accurately and reliably date via U-Pb. An MDA can be pretty close to true depositional age if there was a source of young zircons at the time of deposition, but can also be a pretty rough constraint if the source was predominantly older rocks. If we expand our consideration to non-radiometric techniques, methods like [magnetostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostratigraphy) are quite helpful for dating rocks hosting fossils.
2. Dating rocks above and below the horizon hosting the fossil. If we can't constrain the age of the rock hosting the fossil (e.g., MDAs don't constrain it and/or doesn't contain zircon, the rock is too coarse for magstrat or during a very long normal/reverse period, etc.), we can potentially bracket the age via dating rocks above and below. The most direct example of this would be exploiting interbedded volcanic ash horizons (i.e., tephra) as these effectively represent instantaneous events. If our fossil is hosted in a sedimentary rock with interbedded ashes and we date the one below our fossil to X million years and the one above our fossil to Y million years, then we know the fossil is between X-Y million years old. This is just one straightforward example of this, but there are *lots* of variations on this theme.
3. Correlation. Even if we can't date the rock hosting our fossil in the place we found that fossil, we can often correlate that deposit to a deposit in an area where we can better constrain the age of the deposit. Just like with radiometric dating, there are a whole host of methods for stratigraphic correlation, each with their own uncertainties and challenges, so as with radiometric dating, we try to use a suite of methods to correlate rocks to try to minimize those uncertainties.

Finally, it's worth noting that generally once we have a well established set of age criteria for a given fossil (i.e., we've established its first occurrence and last occurrence in the fossil record through the methods above), it's not as though we are constantly attempting to re-date these fossils. In reality, we also flip it around and *use the fossils to date the rocks*, i.e., [biostratigraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biostratigraphy).

EDIT: It's worth adding that geochronologists are constantly expanding the range of what can be dated. For example, attempts at direct radiometric dating of carbonates with U-Pb was largely considered to produce garbage results for a long time, but gradually we're getting a better handle on how to apply it. Review papers like those from [Rasbury & Cole, 2009](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007RG000246) and [Roberts et al., 2020](https://gchron.copernicus.org/articles/2/33/2020/) highlight how far we've come in our ability to apply this methodology, including (given the right conditions and pretty careful analysis), direct dating of shell material (e.g., [Drost et al., 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018GC007850))."
727,How does time dilation affect short-lived particles?,"This does happen already in our particle colliders! The LHC can make a [pion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion), which have, in their own rest frame, a mean lifetime of 26 nanoseconds. However, the are traveling so fast in the LHC, that they are observed to have a mean life time of 800 nanoseconds instead. 

Also, perhaps of interest, muons are ~~ejected in cosmic rays from the Sun towards Earth~~ created when cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere. Muons live ""a lot"" longer than pions in their own rest frame, they live about 2 microseconds, but that is still far too short of a time to make it ~~from the Sun to the Earth~~ from the upper atmosphere to the surface of the Earth. But, they are traveling so quickly (as measured by an Earth observer) that they make it here frequently. 

Another thing of interest. While an observer on Earth sees the muon traveling very quickly, and thus has time dilation, which is why it can make it to Earth, if you were attached to a muon, you would see things differently. Of course, the muon doesn't think there is time dilation, time is still passing at ""1 second per second"" for the muon. Instead, the muon sees length contraction- it would measure the surface of the Earth as being much closer to the upper atmosphere that we do in our own rest frame.

There's an article linking to a study on the widowhood effect on elderly married couples. I think the answer to your question is yes."
729,Does 'pumped storage hydropower' qualify as a perpetual motion machine?,"You are correct, there is a loss- it takes more electricity to pump the water up to the reservoir than you get by releasing it. The benefit is that you get to choose when to release it. 

The most simple example would be using excess solar power (that is, if during the day you're making more electricity than you need at that time) to pump water up the hill. Then, at night- when you no longer can generate solar power, you release that water, making electricity. As you surmised, there is a net loss of power, but the benefit is, you get the power when you need it."
730,"What species, if any, are descended from the indigenous lifeforms of Antarctica prior to its transition to a frozen desert?","Modern marsupials appear to have originated in South America and spread across Antarctica to Australia. Presuming they didn't make the trek in one generation, all Australian marsupials would thus be descended from Antarctic species."
731,Why our enzymes do not denature when we have fever/temperature?,"That is exactly why high fevers (along with a few other issues) are so dangerous. 


Proteins denature at about 42-43°C. So while your body may start to not work as well as you're used to when you get a fever, the proteins won't denature quite yet."
732,How are the micronutrient contents of fruits and vegetables determined?,"Usually for those nutrients to be absorbed by your body they have to dissolve in some solvents, either water or lipid. You can then try to extract everything in the fruit into this solvent, then use something like high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate them and record the concentration.

Another aspect of this question is the stats, since nutrient contents would vary across varieties and even every individual. I don't know how they're sampled so I would probably leave this question to other people."
733,Does the aurora borealis make a sound since something hitting the atmosphere?,"Usually no--ultimately the atmosphere is being ionized. But there is this study--you'd need to be very far north where the Northern Lights are very strong and where you get temperature inversions:

""In an attempt to lay the question to rest, scientists set up recording equipment in the Finnish village of Fiskars and listened to the night sky. Most of the time the auroras were silent, but to their surprise they found that about 5% of the strongest auroras were associated with whistles, cracks and hisses. The researchers found that the noises always coincided with a temperature inversion (cold air trapped under a lid of warm air) and appear to be caused by the release of static charge, linked to changes in atmospheric electricity caused by the aurora’s disturbance to Earth’s magnetic field.""

734,How come heatsinks dont break JWSTs acoustic cooling?,">
The only moving parts in the cryocooler are the two 2-cylinder horizontally opposed piston pumps in the CCA, and by having horizontally-opposed pistons that are finely balanced and tuned and move in virtually perfect opposition, vibration is mostly cancelled-out and thus minimized.

Based on a simple image I found, they probably dissipate the wave energy rather than amplify it (the ridges in the heatsinks remind me of sound proofing foam) . 

Even if the heatsinks did create extra waves, they probably get cancelled just as the main waves do."
735,Why have box jellyfish evolved beyond other jellyfish to be the most venomous animals on the planet?,"I don't know about jellyfish specifically, but venomous is not a linear scale, it depends both on the venom and the victim. So while ""most venomous to humans"" is a fairly solid concept, ""most venomous"" without that ""to humans"" caveat is not really a thing.

It's quite possible that the jellyfish's natural prey are relatively resistant to whatever is in it's venom and it just kinda by fluke happens to be really bad news for humans.

Funnel web spiders are arguably the most venomous spiders to humans but relatively harmless to cats, dogs and birds.

But killing people is not what their venom is evolved for, that's just an accident, they are actually after insects and small lizards."
736,How Many Neurons do Earthworms Have?,"Most of the papers I've found on earthworms are from a long time ago so it's a little hard to navigate them. Here's a paper that looked at GABAergic neurons but also did a full count of neurons in the earthworm CNS. They found about 5000 neurons ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004410050663](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004410050663)).

You're absolutely correct that C elegans and earthworms have completely different nervous systems!"
737,"how does spinning a football, or ball, make it go farther or more powerful?","(Note: in the answer below I'm assuming you're talking about an American Football)

The spinning football doesn't add any ""power"" to the throw, and in fact, if football was played in a vacuum (say, we all played on the Moon), the spinning ball wouldn't impact the distance of the throw at all. So as you can probably guess from this information, the reason has to do with air resistance. 

How much air resistance an object feels in a given atmosphere depends on a couple of things- speed is the first one (the faster you travel, the more drag) and not so much the size of the object, but the cross sectional area of the object in the direction of motion (this is simplified, but the main thing we care about). So, if you look ""nose on"" to a football, the cross sectional area is less than if you look at the football from the side. So, what you want, to have the least amount of drag on the ball, is for the ball to travel with its nose facing the direction of travel, not the side. 

Adding a spiral to the ball makes it more likely that the nose of the ball will face the direction of travel. Why? Because a spinning ball has angular momentum, and thus it takes a torque to change that momentum. Gravity is pulling perpendicular to the torque, so it can't change the angular momentum, so the only change comes from a little bit of air resistance. Thus, with a ""tight spiral"" (which really just means it left the hand without a wobble, and is spinning fast), the ball will keep doing that during it's flight. But a ball that leaves the hand wobbly will keep wobbling, which means the ball will have more air resistance than it would have otherwise."
738,Where does the expanding energy of freezing water come from?,">where is the energy coming from that bursts the pipe?

It's being subtracted from the energy removed to enable the freezing—the enthalpy released from bonds forming in solid ice. 

You probably didn't notice because you didn't have to make a deliberate effort to remove the heat, as the liquid nitrogen absorbed it. But the freezing temperature dropped somewhat because a larger driving force was required. And if enough energy is required for expansion (that is, if that water is sufficiently compressed), then the heat released by ice formation is insufficient to pay for the mechanical work, and complete freezing into pure ice-Ih won't occur at all—we'll need a combination of ice-Ih and ice-III, at which point we'll need to lower the temperature to around -22°C for complete freezing. This corresponds to an extremely high pressure of about 2000 atmospheres!"
739,Can gynandromorphismus also happen in humans?,"AFAIK, gynandromorphism is not recorded in humans. 
However, Intersex traits are possible and occur in about 1.7% of humans worldwide--about as prevalent as people with red hair! Intersex used to be referred to as hermaphroditism (some may still use this term) and there are a broad range of intersex phenotypes that can present...if i recall correctly, there are currently around 150 ""types"" in which intersex can present."
740,Why does sleep deprivation cause headaches?,"Adequate restful sleep reduces blood pressure by allowing the clearing of stress hormones such as cortisol from the body - blood pressure drops as much as 17% during sleep. Sleep deprivation causes elevated levels of cortisol, which continue to rise the longer one is denied sleep. Increased cortisol leads to increased blood pressure and systemic inflammation, and thus headaches.

Sleep is also responsible for clearing adenosine (a byproduct of energy consumption in the body, the adenosine in ATP) from the brain. Elevated levels of adenosine in the brain trigger sleepiness and increased pressure to sleep, which may be felt as headaches."
741,Why is it harder to push snow as it gets deeper?,"A mix of all those things you mentioned

More snow = heavier = more inertia = harder to push 

Snow is made of water and water gets heavy because of how dense it is. That’s also why a “wet snow” is sow much more annoying than “dry” snow like in Colorado"
742,What animals have the most living generations at one time?,"Discounting the weirder stuff like sponges and jellyfish (the polyp stage can be around for a long time but the medusa stage is quite short lived, so you can have a lot of generations of polyps hanging around but all the intermediate medusa stages will be dead), I imagine earthworms should be pretty high up there. A red wriggler can live 5 years, and they reach maturity in under 60 days. That's 30 ish generations if all goes well."
743,"Is there any unbias research that proves that sports drinks (Gatorade, Powerade, etc) actually hydrate you ""better"" than water?","I don’t know the link to the study, but a study said that it doesn’t hydrate more than water.

745,How long would it take to walk across the sun?,"You'd actually have to swim. Since there is no well defined surface, you'd sink until you were a few hundred km below the photosphere, when your density would equal the plasma density so you'd be buoyant. At that point, you'd need to swim. Assuming survival in 6000 degree plasma is possible, an you can breath hydrogen, that is."
746,Would there be any difference between human males and human females if they received the same amount and type of hormones during life and before being born?,"Yes. There would be differences. Sex determination in utero does depend on the well known sex hormones estrogen and testosterone, but its started with the presence (or absence) of testis determine factor a gene which codes for anti-mullerian hormone. 

The genetically female person would be infertile and would not develop proper testes due to an absence of anti-mullerian hormone encoded for on the Y chromosome, but would have a penis and underdeveloped uterus. 

The genetically male individual would probably also be infertile due to likely lacking functional ovaries and a fully functional uterus, though there are reports of fertility in 46,XY women.

Tldr; Estrogen and testosterone control sexual differentiation at puberty but its more complicated before birth."
747,Is it/could it be possible to transfer a live embryo from one womb to another?,"I think before the nidation it might be possible in theory. The main problem here would be finding that tiny thing somewhere between the tubes and the uterus and then retrieving it without damaging too much. The rest would be very similar to IVF but with an added risk of infection.

After nidation I can't see at all how this would work."
748,Are political beliefs driven by education or occupation?,"Like most things in life it is a bidirectional relationship. People ask the question - is it nature or nurture that drives development - the reality is both. We call these [gene x environment correlations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128093245218269) \- that is, what is innate to you (nature) makes you seek out certain things which in turn is reinforced by that environment you sought out or you are surrounded by (nurture).

With careers it's been found that people in certain careers tend to have typecasted beliefs, morals, attitudes so on.  Not everyone is one-to-one the same of course, but it's been found that politicians tend to have higher levels of compulsive lying, and otherwise emotionally manipulative and become more so the deeper they are into the career. Soldiers become more emotionally numb or cold, hardened if you will, as of a result of their career choices. Psychologists are said to be more open-minded of others.

With that in mind, let's return to my original point. People of certain political beliefs tend to have a certain way of thinking - conservatives value money and ""traditional"" beliefs, liberals are argued to be open-minded etc (these are simplifications obviously, but bear with me). It's not surprising therefore, that someone who seeks more traditional ways of work (avoid schooling in a university) and value more monetary gain would seek careers that allow them to achieve said goal. The choices necessary to succeed in said career (wanting more economic freedom - ie. less government oversight over business) would in turn reinforce those beliefs and make it a stronger pattern in the person's character."

752,What limits the maximum RPM of an electric motor?,"Your dad is wrong on several fronts.  In rough terms, motor current = torque, not top speed (that’s more a function of voltage to counter back EMF).  

Also, there are absolutely mechanical limits to maximum motor speed.  At some point, the centripetal acceleration on the rotor exceeds the ability of the rotor to keep itself in one piece and you get a high energy grenade.

Stator inertia doesn’t really impact maximum speed other than it defines the energy in the grenade when you overspeed and explode a rotor."

757,Are there such things as natural oil spills? Does nature have a way of dealing with this?,"Petroleum can leak out of the ground naturally. The le brea tar pits have been around for like 50,000 years. They are full of skeletons of animals that died from getting stuck in the tar. There are micro organisms capable of breaking down oil. I would imagine sun light and weather will also deteriorate it. 

One of the problem with man made oil spills is that they bring much more petroleum to the surface very quickly. The oil is still full of toxic volatile chemicals that would be dispersed slowly over a long period of time from natural seepage.  The oil we drill for is also deep under ground, where it is under high pressure. If a well is breached, it will spray out an amount of oil that couldn't naturally get to the surface like that."
758,Why do open label studies exist?,"There are several potential reasons for open label studies.  Off the top of my head.  
  
1.  Very early stage exploration.  Maybe they don't want to spend the money on a truly double-blind study to pay twice as many participants.  If an open-label study is promising, maybe some more money can be invested in a better, double-blind study.  
  .
2.  Ethics.  Sometimes, it wouldn't be ethical to give a participant a placebo.  This usually comes up for experimental medications in terminal illnesses.  The models say this new medication **should** work.  Who's going to tell half our terminal patients at the end of this, ""By the way, we had this drug that we thought would work, but we have you sugar pills because the experiment was more important than your life.""  Those patients might disagree with that value judgment.)  
  .
3.  Obviousness of effect.  If the participants are going to figure out on their own that they are getting a sugar pill, there's no point.  This comes up with medications that have obvious effects that a participant will definitely notice are there or are absent.  Say, a known consciousness-altering drug is given out, and half the participants are tasting colors, while the other half feel nothing unusual.  The double-blind aspect of the study is negated.

759,Are there analogous processes to evolution in non-living things? Do crystals evolve?,"This is a definitional question - what do you mean evolve? If you mean ‘change’ then yes. If you mean something more narrow, it may not be the case. It also depends a little on what you mean by non-living things, but I think that is of secondary importance. 

For example crystals don’t have any Darwinian elements to them. The bigger crystals aren’t evolving to eat smaller ones. Yes crystal change over time, but it’s not really competitive. 

On the other hand, businesses could be said to be Darwinian in that there is competition and they will consume, kill, waste away etc. 

You could mean something even more narrow, which might also apply to the non-living thing of viruses."

761,Why does tobacco smoking have higher cancer risk than smoking other plants?,"A less know contributor of the lung cancer risk from smoking tobacco stems from Polonium-210 and Uranium-decay products present in the soil. Tobacco is a known accumulator of these elements, resulting in enhaced levels of radioactive elements in the smoke you inhale. Polonium-210 emits alpha-radiation, which is, introduced directly in your tissue/body, quite harmful.

>For example, one study found that a person smoking two packs a day is exposed to about 5 times as much polonium as a non-smoker but specific parts of their lungs could be exposed to hundreds of times more radiation. Another study estimated that smoking a pack-and-a-half every day exposes a smoker to a dose of radiation equivalent to 300 chest X-rays a year.  
>  
>Do these doses lead to lung cancer? It’s hard to say, especially since the effects of polonium are only part of a wider range of damaging consequences caused by inhaling cigarette smoke. But animal studies certainly give us cause for concern.  
>  
>Absorbed doses of radiation can be measured using units called rads, and experiments have shown that as little as 15 rads of polonium can induce lung cancers in mice. That’s only about a fifth of what a smoker would get if they averaged 2 packs a day for 25 years. Indeed, the lung tissues of smokers who have died of lung cancer have absorbed about 80-100 rads of radiation.

764,"When metal gets very hot, it turns, red, then orange, then yellow, then blue, then white. Why does it skip green and violet?","The phenomenon you're talking about is ""black body radiation"".

The name is weird, it comes from the concept to imagine a perfect black sphere floating in space, black to every frequency of electro magnetism, that is too say it absorbs everything. It will keep getting hotter and hotter and so must shed this heat energy, but how?

The way it emits heat is a modified bell curve of probability drawn on the electro magnetic spectrum, starting with its peak very low on the infrared. As the heat increases this bell curve moves towards higher frequencies as these carry more energy.

The higher frequencies (or shorter wavelengths) appear more blue than red. You are right that it appears the skip green and violet, the reason is that the bell curve of light emitted is broad, not a focused frequency like a laser, but we don't see the IR and UV which gives us this illusion.

Your order is a little off, but here's an explanation of what's happening at each colour:
- invisible (the peak is low in the IR spectrum)
- red (peaking in IR)
- yellow (the peak is red, but it is also shedding green if looked through a prism) 
- white (the peak is green, but the peak is now so high and broad all visible frequencies are emitting about the same brightness)
- pale blue (the peak is now violet, but it still emits highly in the green frequencies)
- edit: after this it just gets brighter pale blue, it never shifts violet (but the peak is moving towards higher frequencies)

The filament of an incandescent light bulb is a perfect example, the temperature of the filament, measured in degrees Kelvin, is equal to the light colour. We use this temperature to describe the ""colour temperature"" of LED lights which replace them, 3000K is orange 6000K is bright blue. These temperatures are 5000°f and 10,000°f respectively.

[this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/wien3.html) page includes a graph which might help visualise this.

It is a property of all matter, but samples of pure elements will have specific frequency steps they naturally prefer to emit from, you might see flickers of green and blue on a camp fire, this is the same. Tricking these atoms to produce only specific frequencies is how we produce the colours of fireworks, the yellow of sodium street lights, or lasers. 

Hope this helps.

Edit: in bullet points it never goes more violet than pale blue perceivably.

Edit 2: warm light bulbs are lower than 4000K"
765,Why don’t the spectral lines of a substance correspond to its observable color?,"I think your confusion comes from lumping together a couple concepts in the single idea of ""spectral lines.""  The color you see when you look at something is the wavelengths of light that get reflected, not emitted.  Unless you're talking about phosphorescence or fluorescence (the material was first excited by exposing it to light, and now it is giving that energy back as light with characteristic wavelengths), the color you see comes from the light you are illuminating the material with, less whatever wavelengths the material absorbed.  So absorption wavelengths do come into play, but they are the colors you **don't** see.

The reason you don't see colors from emission spectral lines, is that you are normally looking at materials in their ground state.  Emission takes place from electronic excited states:  when an electron drops back down from an excited state orbital to a ground state (or lower excited state) orbital.  So you do see this in a [flame test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_test), or [phosphorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence), or [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence).  And astronomers do study emission lines to identify the chemicals in [protoplanetary disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk), where newly formed stars are irradiating and exciting the gasses around them.  But these are not the typical conditions you are looking at a material with, in your day to day experience.

And then there are metals.  They are a little different then the atoms themselves, in that the valence electrons are no longer in orbitals characteristic of a specific atom, like they would be in a flame test. The valence electrons in a bulk metal delocalize and form a sea of electrons in a more or less continuous [valence or conductance band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_and_conduction_bands).  These behave differently and metals typically look shiny, instead of colored.

TLDR:  So you don't see colors from absorbance spectral lines **because**  they are absorbed.  And you don't see emission spectral line colors, except in special cases when something is exciting the material."

It is related to atomic number because of the charge of the nucleus and the number of elections, but not in a linear way. The most important thing is how full the outer shell of elections is. Elements with the same valence shell are organized into columns on the table. Within this group many of the differences are caused by the radius of the atom."
770,"If mountains are formed from the interaction of tectonic plates buckling together, could there be a noticeable 'seam' between the two old plates somewhere along a mountain range?","Yes, the term you're looking for is a [suture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suture_%28geology%29). It's worth discussing a few other points here though.

> If mountains are formed from the interaction of tectonic plates buckling together

So, a better way to think about this is that collisional mountain ranges (like the Himalaya) form because one plate is shoved/dragged under another, as opposed to them ""buckling"". Before a collisional mountain range starts to form, the two pieces of continental lithosphere that will eventually collide to form the mountains are separated by an ocean basin (floored by oceanic lithosphere), typically with a [subduction zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) between them. As subduction continues, the ocean basin shrinks until eventually continental lithosphere enters the subduction zone and the mountain range starts to form slowly. The slab of subducted material that is still hanging out in the mantle (and attached to the continental portion of the plate that is ""going under"" the other) is typically an important driver for mountain range formation (for more on what makes the plates move in general and the role of subduction, check out [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/)). If you want an overview of mountain building (and the follow ups), reading up on the [Wilson Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Cycle) might be helpful. The Wilson Cycle is heavily idealized and all of the steps almost never happen in the exact order, but the general processes described in the Wilson Cycle do happen.

> My guess on it has to do with either the initial formation of a mountain being quite violent and hot enough to fuse the rising summits together

The formation of mountains isn't really any more violent than any other plate interaction. The movement of one plate under the other is accomplished by earthquakes, but the same was true for the subduction zone before the mountain range and virtually any other plate boundary. Collisional mountains form slowly, like most every other geologic process. Sutures can be marked by magmatism and things like plutons, etc., but not always.

> could there be a noticeable 'seam' between the two old plates somewhere along a mountain range?

Back to this idea of a suture, the one tricky thing is that not all sutures are easily recognizable, but many are. Because mountain ranges are preceded by the existence of an ocean basin and subduction, some sutures are marked by [ophiolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiolite), basically bits of oceanic crust that have been scraped up and trapped between the two continental plates defining what we would call an *ophiolitic suture*. Ophiolitic sutures are relatively easy to notice because ophiolites are pretty unique and pretty much always indicate a suture. The formation of mountain ranges can also lead to a fair bit of melting within the crust, so sometimes older sutures in heavily eroded ranges can be recognized by zones of igneous intrusions. They also tend to represent zones of significant deformation, so can be recognizable that way. However, not all sutures have ophiolites or other clear outward signs that they are in fact a suture, especially in younger mountain ranges where there has not been as much exhumation and erosion of deeper rocks. These would be better described as *cryptic sutures*, which basically means in the field they kind of look like any other fault. Identifying cryptic sutures is a bit more challenging and usually requires doing a lot of work on the basic geology of the fault bounded blocks within a mountain range to try to identify where there is a major change in some aspect of the bedrock that might tell you the bits on either side used to be separated by a large basin. Here for example is a [paper](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/135981/tect20504.pdf?sequence=1) that attempts to look for and define the location of a cryptic suture in the Greater Caucasus mountains using where sediment was coming from in different parts of the mountain range and hypothesizing that a cryptic suture exists between where there is a major change in sediment source."
771,Can wildlife genetic diversity be increased with cloning?,"Yes with a limitation. A couple of years back there was a black-footed ferret clone born for the first time and the motivation for cloning was explicitly in part to use older DNA to bring back a bit of the diversity that existed decades ago. If you have DNA from a much older specimen, preferably before a bottleneck event, you can clone it and reduce the risks of inbreeding.

The limitation is actually having the DNA. The ferret that was cloned was kept frozen for thirty years. There's no guarantee that the DNA will be intact enough to work from a preserved specimen because things like taxidermy are focused on keeping things recognizable rather than functional. Some cases it might work but if they aren't pulling specimens out of the ice the use will probably be fairly limited."

778,Antiviral medications - What are their different traits and applications in real life scenarios?,"Antibiotics don't ""nuke everything"", but you are correct in that they are much more indiscriminate in what they ""kill"" than antivirals are.  One reason for this is the relative complexity of bacteria compared to viruses. Bacterial genomes are far larger, and code for far more proteins than viruses do.  Add to this the fact that bacteria are alive and able to replicate on their own, while viruses rely in large part on the machinery of the infected cells to make more viruses.

For example, tetracycline in a broad spectrum (meaning effective against many different types of bacteria) which stops bacterial protein production by irreversibly binding to bacterial ribosomes (the part of any cell responsible for making new protein).  However, bacterial ribosomes are different enough from human ribosomes that your cells happily keep making protein, while the bacteria can't and die.   Nearly all bacteria have the same ribosomal structure so it works well against a lot of different bacterial species.

However, viruses don't have ribosomes.  They infect your cells and use your ribosomes to make their protein.  An antiviral which stops viral protein synthesis in the same way as tetracycline stops bacterial protein synthesis (by binding to and blocking the means of production) would assuredly kill the virus, but you would be dead also as your body would be unable to make new proteins.

Instead, many antivirals are designed to target a specific virus.  I'll use your herpes/acyclovir example above.  Acyclovir acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis and is a type of molecule known as a nucleoside analog.  That means it looks sort of like a molecule which is used in DNA synthesis, but has important parts missing.  The enzymes humans use to synthesize DNA are sophisticated enough to realize that acyclovir is a ""fake"" and doesn't use it in DNA synthesis.  However, herpesviruses have their own version of this enzyme that doesn't realize acyclovir is a fake and happily utilize it to make new DNA.  However, acyclovir is missing a part of the molecule that is required to add the next base in the chain, and therefore DNA synthesis stops.  Yes, this can affect the infected cell also, but it is infected with a virus and is doomed anyway.

Fun fact-there are 8 distinct human herpesviruses, and as far as I know acyclovir works against most if not all of them.

BUT-because viruses evolved much differently than bacteria, other viruses use much different strategies than herpesvirues do to make new DNA, and therefore acyclovir (or any drug in ""cyclovir"" family) do not work on viruses outside of herpesviruses.

There are antivirals, such as interferon, which work by targeting your immune system rather than the virus directly.  These types of drugs serve to ""supercharge"" your immune system.  An increase in interferon is like an alarm on a military base.  It tells your immune cells there is a problem (infection) somewhere and they by God better muster up, make more immune cells, and spread out around the body and figure out what the problem is."
779,Can it be possible for an exoplanet's ocean to not be salty?,"Certain chemical elements are highly water soluble. They are also reasonably common as the materials for a rocky planet to be formed from (things like sodium, lithium, chlorine etc). It would be very unlikely that a planet with liquid water on it would not have any processes in which these elements would end up getting dissolved into the water, especially so if there is dry land and an evaporation/precipitation water cycle that would cause water based erosion of rocks. Even without this, where the water meets the rock, over geological time some of the minerals from the rock would eventually leech out into the water."
780,Seeds may lay dormant for years until you plant them. What makes a seed start to grow when I plant it?,"I'm a farmer and work with seed breeders and agricultural researchers, so I can definitely say this is a fascinating and critically important question!

Looking at wheat, a plant whose product of importance are its seeds, which also serve to regrow the next crop.  Humans have two somewhat misaligned goals for their breeding programs with wheat:

1) We want the seeds to be resistant to premature sprouting from rain events prior to harvest, when the seeds are still in the head.  As this can begin enzymatic processes that tank baking quality.

2) But we want seeds to germinate and grow vigorously when planted into even low moisture conditions.  Because the earlier the crop is up, the better it will yield.

There are many factors that influence grass seed germination (wheat in this case). 

Fire:  Seeds exposed to smoke or fire are primed to germinate much more readily.  This adaptation allows them to take advantage of the clearing created by wildfire.  So seeds are smoke sensitive. 

Time:  Wheat generally doesn't germinate as well immediately after it's harvested.  Historically some varieties were particularly bad at this when farmers were early seeding it back into the ground only 30 days or so after harvest.  The seed industry term ""sweating"" is used to describe seed that has been intentionally stored for long enough for the seed to count out its internal clock and achieve full germination rate.

Conversely, there will always be a percentage of seeds that absolutely refuse to germinate in the first season.  This is a population survival strategy in case an adverse event wipes out everything.  There will still be survivors in the soil bank to reestablish a population.  This is the strategy that the grassy weeds we struggle with evolved to evade our control methods.  And it's a strong remnant behavior in secondary crops like rye and oats, which were once wild and readily go feral again.

I have seen rye seed lie dormant for over 5 years in the ground before reemerging.

Soil Cues:  Even when seeds have sufficient moisture for germination they are very sensitive to the presence of other things in the soil.  Seeds particularly do not like to be placed into soil mixed with undecomposed vegetation.  This is a smart strategy, as they are at greater risk of desiccation there.  They likely detect the same chemicals surrounding them that they do when still within the unthreshed head, and resist germinating.  Farmers call this ""hairpinning"" - when seeds are folded within a tuft of straw tucked into soil in turn.  We set up and alter seeding implements to prevent it, or if it's not preventable we must seed at a higher rate to offset the increased mortality.

Wheat is remarkably stable in the whole seed form.  You can still process it into flour after decades.  And amazingly enough there are some university studies on long-term germination that get seeds over 100 years old to grow without any special measures.

There's a reason humans have partnered with wheat for 12,000 years."

787,What does a UV light actually show when it is used for detecting biological stains?,"You're seeing fluorescence, not reflection. Fluorescent chemicals absorb (invisible or barely visible) ultraviolet light and re-emit it as visible light. The exact colors absorbed and emitted depend on the chemicals, and can be used to distinguish bodily fluids, as seen in [a recent *Scientific Reports* article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30241-7).

Surprisingly little seems to be known about the actual chemicals involved. The article linked above suggests tryptophan (an amino acid), miscellaneous small molecules like 4-pyridoxic acid, flavins, porphyrins, NADH and FAD, some proteins like collagen, and ""fluorescent oxidation products,"" which are presumed to be the result of oxidation of proteins and lipids. (Despite a widely repeated internet claim, it's not due to phosphorus. Elemental phosphorus is not present in any bodily fluid. Fortunately.)

As the article shows, stains can be fluorescent for many days, and for some fluids the fluorescence actually increases with time. So they could be old, if the sheets weren't washed. But I would expect most of these chemicals to be removed or destroyed in a wash, especially one with bleach. Some of the more proteiny stains could be difficult to remove completely in a single wash, though they wouldn't be actually dangerous at that point, if they ever were.

It's also worth noting that laundry detergents often contain fluorescent chemicals themselves, so some of the ""bodily fluids"" that people freak out about in hotels may actually be detergent that touched or dripped on the sheets as they were moved around the laundry room."

You are right that Whole Blood contains both red blood cells and plasma. **Because of this, there is no universal donor for Whole Blood.** For most transfusions we do not transfuse Whole Blood. Usually, your Whole Blood donation is separated and processed into two other products: Packed Red Blood Cells and some form of Plasma (Fresh Frozen, PF24, Liquid). For reasons stated above, the universal donor for pRBCs is O Neg. And the universal donor for Plasma is AB (Rh-type doesn't matter).

Normally in emergencies where we don't know the patients blood type. We transfuse all the parts of Whole Blood separately. We give group O pRBCs, AB plasma, and Platelets (where type generally doesn't matter)

In extreme emergencies, where patients have massive hemorrhage, some places may carry and transfuse Whole Blood regardless of blood type. This product is usually called Low Titer O Whole Blood. We use O Blood so the RBCs are guaranteed to be compatible, but O Whole Blood has antibodies in the plasma that can be dangerous (Anti-A, Anti-B, and even a third one somewhat confusingly called Anti-A,B). So what we do is ""titer"" the donors to see how strong these antibodies are, and select only weaker ""low titer"" donors. This minimizes the risk of possible transfusion reaction. Most places that do use Low Titer O will only give 2 or 4 units of it before switching to individual components."

Simply cup your hands behind each ear to make them bigger and observe the changes to your hearing. You may notice that sounds become clearer in the direction that you are aiming the ""radar dish"" of your ears, and that's because you are collecting more of the sound wave coming from that direction. More vibrational energy is reaching your ear drum and sending a stronger electrical signal to your brain. 

However, how each person's brain interprets the signal after it's turned from vibration to neurons is more complex. Just like colors, sound isn't really an objective thing in our reality; it's made up in our brains as the way we perceive small vibrations in the air around us. If the areas in our brain that interpret those signals are damaged or develop differently in the first place, what we seem to ""hear"" will be a unique experience for each person, even if the shape and size of our ears is identical."
793,"Why do these Gallium drops ""pop"" when fusing?","The reason the droplets merge is due to Ostwald ripening. There is less surface area in one big droplet than in many small droplets of the same total volume, so the system can reduce energy by merging into one big droplet. 

The reason a merge event causes a ""pop"" is due to surface tension and the intermediate shape of the merging droplets. Initially, there are two spherical surfaces separated by a thin film of air, water, or whatever is around the drops. When the droplets just start to merge, they make a sort of hourglass-like shape, with extremely sharp curvature at the ""neck."" If you think of an atom of gallium positioned right at the sharp neck, the forces of surface tension tangent to the surface are not balanced. 

Compare to an atom on the surface of a perfect sphere. Locally to a single atom, the surface forms a flat plane around it, pulling it equally in all directions, so it doesn't move because there is no net force. At the neck, there is a net force, so the atom start to accelerate outward. The velocity of the ring of atoms around the next gets faster and faster until the neck becomes a flat connection between the two spheres. At this point, the net force is zero, but the atoms still have an outward velocity. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a force, so those atoms keep going until the neck bulges out. Then, an oppositely curved surface will start pulling them back. This makes the surface of the sphere oscillate back and forth for a bit, and this oscillation is what bounces all the other droplets around. Picture little beads bouncing on a vibrating subwoofer."

Particles can also move along the magnetic field direction, then their path becomes a helix, and you need to make sure that helix stays within the plasma, that's why they have the overall ring-like pattern: The magnetic field lines go in a circle, too.

For heating there are a couple of options, [Wikipedia has a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak#Plasma_heating).

However, to refer to the period that you’re likely thinking of, when mammoths and giant ground sloths and saber tooth tigers walked the earth, scientists use the term “last glacial maximum”.
As you can see from [this visualization](https://i.redd.it/i731448edv071.png) there were more or less the same oceans we have now, except at the poles.
Hope this helps!"
801,Does the human body use a significant amount of energy fighting germs?,"Yes, when you are “fighting” an active infection you do use a lot of energy and resources in order to maintain or restore the conditions required to clear the germs and restore the damages done by the infection."
802,In what way do Shark anatomies vary to cause such substantial differences in densities?,"Weight and density are only related at constant volume. While sand tiger sharks are slender like an eel, belugas are chunky like a fire hydrant. This leads to greater volume. They also do not have the same length

As for why weight goes up so much more with length, you have to think about math (bummer, i know). You can think in terms of units, where length is in meters, area is in meters squared, and volume is in meters cubed. If length goes up by s factor of x, then area will go up by a factor of x squared, and volume will go up by a factor of x cubed! You can play with squares and cubes to prove this if you'd like. This also works with circles and spheres. 


So hypothetically if a whale got ""twice as big"", assuming it's twice as long/wide/tall, the change in weight is 2x2x2 = 8!"

804,"If a virus was completely asymptomatic, genuinely having no effect on it's hosts-- would we even know it exists?","I might blow your mind but these kinda actually do exist. Our DNA is riddled with DNA from ancient viruses that infected our ancestors. At some point in the past these viruses became permanently incorporated into our genetic material. It's also theorized that these fragments pay an important part in evolution.

We realized these existed from studying our genetic sequence and noticing patterns in it that were almost identical to those found in viruses. And since these don't actively make new virus molecules they are as asymptomatic as it gets."
805,Why do unsaturated fats have lower melting points than saturated fats when they have double bonds?,"The energy involved in melting fat is well below the point where molecular bonds (at least those in fats) start to break.

The reason why unsaturated fats have lower melting points is that unlike straight-chained saturated fatty acid, the double bonds inside (cis-)unsaturated fatty acids [introduce a kink in the carbon chain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Rasyslami.jpg). Those bent chains cannot pack together as neatly as the straight chains of saturated fats, and so it takes less energy (and thus a lower temperature) to break them out of a packed-together solid structure and melt them."
806,How will you know a vacuum had been achieved ?,"There are really many different kinds of ""vacuum gauges."" In summary, any physical phenomenon that depends on the background pressure can be used as a measure of the quality of the vacuum - just how little air is left in your experiment.  


1-at reasonable pressures, \~10% of atmospheric pressure, gauges that have mechanical dials and involve feeling the difference in force between the normal atmosphere and the vacuum using a spring can be used to measure how ""good"" the vacuum is (how little gas there is). But when the pressure is low, these gauges essentially just report 0, or their calibration error. And physics experiments are often sensitive to much lower densities of gas so we move onto better kinds of gauges.  


2-Pirani gauges measure the heat conductivity between a hot wire and a metal chamber that it's inside of. If there's gas, it will help conduct heat between the two points. I would guess they are valid down to about 10\^-3mbar (10\^-5 atm), at which point blackbody radiation dominates the heat conductivity anyway.

3-Ionization gauges typically involve a beam, or trapped plasma of electrons. These electrons ionize background gas, which find their way to a collector, and the electrical current through that collector is measured as a measure of the gas pressure. These measure down to about 10\^-9 mbar (10\^-12atm).

4-[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0189.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0189.pdf) magnetooptical traps (MOTs) measure down to 10\^-10 mbar by the way their laser cooled gas responds to the background gas. if I understand correctly, the advantage here over ionization gauges is that ionization gauges at low pressures measure... something that's kind of monotonic in pressure... but they aren't very accurate. I think the MOT measurements are expected to actually be accurate.

5-experiments that have access to antiprotons (only a handful of experiments in the antimatter factory at CERN) measure their vacuum by how long it takes for an antiproton to make contact with an atom and the two destroy eachother. BASE has used this to upper bound their vacuum at 10\^-18mbar. The vacuum at BASE is so good because it leverages the phenomenon of cold pumping - making the walls of the experiment 4K then all gasses freeze onto it.  [http://cds.cern.ch/record/2282371/files/fulltext.pdf](http://cds.cern.ch/record/2282371/files/fulltext.pdf)  


6-the ionization gauge concept can be upgraded to meaure much lower pressures (10\^-14mbar I'd guess) using something like an MCP, which gives a measurable signal from single ions. The experiment I work on uses this technique occasionally, but I don't think we've ever properly calibrated it so I have no idea how to convert a few dots on an MCP to an actual gas density/pressure.

7-I don't have a paper in mind, but I know this is a thing - highly charged ions (a heavy atom with all or almost all its electrons stripped away) are expected to be an even better vacuum gage than antiprotons. When they come into contact with a gas atom, they happily rip away one or more electrons from that gas atom. If the particle trap is set up so that it only traps the highly charged ion, it will be lost and can be counted."

809,Why does metabolism slow down during sleep?,"Your posture has nothing to do with your metabolism. 

It slows down because our body's need for energy decreases. 

Your temperature slightly drops down during sleep, which results in your basal metabolic rate going down. Your metabolic rate then has an effect on hormone levels such as cortison and melatonin.   
Your skeletal muscles relax for the most part as well. Those are the ones that require a lot of your daily energy. Your body then stimulates tissue repair and removal of waste products, which do not require as much energy."
810,Does your body develop a “pee safety” mechanism for sleeping as you get older?,"I think it's your brain actually gaining more control of your body.

The sphincter that opens your urethra is actually always trying to open up, but your body sends signals through neurons to the muscles to constrict. Once you actually want to pee, you get inhibition of those neurons => the external urethral sphincter opens up => you pee

Other factors also contribute to this, such as the bladder capacity, which increases until adulthood."
811,How did water form on earth?,"Water is pretty common in the solar system. Comets are basically dirty snowballs, for example. Other planets and moons have plenty of water too, Europa being a very clear example. There must have been plenty of water around when the solar system formed.

That water would have been spread pretty evenly around the solar system. Some of it would have been amongst the material which accreted to form Earth. That water is distributed throughout Earth - not just on the surface, but inside the planet. Don't just think of liquid water or ice. There's water chemically bound in many of the minerals which make up the crust and mantle.

In fact whatever water was originally present on the surface is gone now. The initiation of solar fusion would have stripped the surfaces of the inner planets of any gases and liquids on the surfaces. 

The water we have in the surface now was mostly originally inside the Earth, brought to the surface by volcanic eruptions. Impacts of comets and other solar system objects would have added a little, but a tiny percentage compared to what has been brought out by volcanic outgassing."

814,How does ultraviolet light in the non-ionizing range induce cellular damage that causes cancer?,"While UV radiation has insufficient energy to strip an electron from biological molecules, it has enough to move susceptible molecules to metastable excited states.  While in these excited states, these molecules react with other species within the cell to create excess amounts of reactive oxygen species (e.g. OH^(-), O₂^(-), H₂O₂). These ROS diffuse within the cell causing oxidative stress, including DNA damage"
815,Can tornadoes form on Venus?,"Tornadoes need two ingredients to form: strong vertical wind shear (i.e., the wind changes rapidly as you go up in altitude) and strong vertical motions.  Venus appears to have little of either.  On Earth and Mars, dust devils are formed because the sun heating the surface creates plumes of hot and buoyant air, which as it rises ""converts"" the vertical wind shear into horizontal wind shear, resulting in a small vortex.  Tornadoes are formed in a similar way, but in that case, the ascending plumes of buoyant air are caused by deep convection in a thunderstorm, which can result in much more powerful vortices: tornadoes.

Venus is covered in clouds, and it seems unlikely to me that you would get the same kind of convection at the surface that you do with clear-sky atmospheres on the Earth and Mars that lead to dust devils.  There are indeed large convection cells in the Venusian atmosphere due to solar heating of the atmosphere itself, but they seem to be high up in the clouds and not at the surface.  Venus has very few ""condensible,"" which by their release of latent heat give rise to deep moist convection (water vapor condensing into liquid water and releasing latent heat plays this role in a terrestrial thunderstorm) Venus also does not have strong vertical wind shear, particularly at the surface.  Thus I think anything like a dust devil or tornado is probably quite rare, if not completely absent, on Venus.

A lot of people are commenting about Venus' polar vortex, which is totally unrelated to a tornado.  Polar vortices are common features of planetary atmospheres and result from the planetary-scale circulation of the atmosphere.  Tornadoes and dust devils are several orders of magnitude smaller in scale and are transient features.  One interesting feature of the Venusian atmosphere is that the solid planet rotates extremely slowly, so slowly that there is no appreciable Coriolis force.  Thus the atmospheric dynamics on Venus is very different from that of Earth and the other planets with significant atmospheres.  The atmospheres of Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are littered with cyclones, anticyclones, and jet streams, all of which rely on a balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force (geostrophic dynamics).  But on Venus the primary balance is between pressure gradients and the centrifugal force (cyclostrophic balance), which leads to very different dynamics. In addition, as I mentioned earlier Venus does not really have moist convection, which means that there are not really any storms (depending on how you define the word ""storm"")."

817,Why are there fears that are shared by a lot of people? Are fears inherited or learned?,"Bit of both. We seem to be primed for certain fears with an evolutionary benefit, and the early humans with the greatest tolerance for standing by cliffsides or poking snakes were less likely to pass on their genes. That said, fear learning is also a process. Parents always showed fear in connection with a stimulus? More likely to fear it. Injured the last time you dae something? ""Once burned, twice shy."""

819,How do we feel that something is wet by just touching it?,"While you don't have specific detectors for water molecules, you have detectors for pressure, temperature, the smoothness and roughness of objects, slipperiness, etc. 

So while you're not detecting water molecules themselves, you're detecting a typical pattern of pressure, temperature and smoothness, that your brain recognizes as ""wet"". Your vision also helps; if you can visibly see it's wet, that'll help your brain feel wetness. 

Since we can't actually sense water molecules and we sense a pattern of temperature and pressure instead, some objects can give an illusion of wetness when touched blindly; certain types of cold metal objects for example."
820,Why do hearts have FOUR chambers not two?,"The reason is that [a four-chambered heart allows continuous inflow, while also allowing intermittent high-pressure pumped outflow.](http://cardiac-output.info/1967AHJ.pdf)

If you only had a two-chambered heart, every time a chamber pumped, you would need to seal off the inlet to that chamber (otherwise, the chamber would pump blood in both directions, forward and backward at the same time!) This would mean, for example, sealing off the vena cava for every single heartbeat, which would cause blood in the vena cava to stop moving completely (and back up) with every single heartbeat, which would be terribly inefficient.

So you introduce two ""waiting rooms"" for the pumping chambers, the atria. Blood can continuously flow into them, but the opening between them and the ventricle can be sealed for every ventricle-pump. So you have continuous inflow of blood, which can collect until the ventricle is ready to receive it...then the collected blood can be quickly (but more gently) pumped into the waiting ventricle, which can then forcefully pump that blood forward *while more blood collects in the atrium behind it*. Blood keeps moving, the ventricle spends less down-time waiting to fill with blood, and everybody wins!

826,How does a flower that is self pollinating get enough gene diversity for it to not be damaged by inbreeding basically?,"One factor is that many plants have more than just pairs of chromosomes - they may have 4+ copies of the same chromosome.  This provides protection against inbreeding by increasing the reserve of diversity within any population / region.  So assuming there's some normal cross-plant pollination going on, a few generations of inbreeding isn't a big deal.

Also, inbreeding just isn't that big a deal anyhow, at least not for populations of plants.   The consequences can be harsh for individuals, which bothers us when it happens to fellow humans or pets, but as regards a species, it is a useful tool driving evolution or even domestic breeding.  The fact that some seeds may not flourish is not really a big problem for a plant population, especially if it means some few individuals do abnormally well.
Many domestic animals a highly inbred.  When I worked with lab mice, they were intentionally inbred for 20+ generations to ensure genetic consistency.  The inbreeding helped insure an ABSENCE of (unwanted) defects."

829,Does memorizing cause forgetfulness in other things?,"No specific articles come to mind, but my understanding from studying some cog. psych. courses and reading up on research is that human long term memory doesn't seem to have limits in a strict sense. So in general, you shouldn't worry that you will forget due to capacity being reached.
AFAIK there are two main theories for forgetting - one is that it happens due to decay, other due to interference. Interference means that if you have some knowledge that is similar to what you are trying to learn e.g. Japanese, this old knowledge might be affected somewhat and be more difficult to recall sometimes. Or that this old knowledge can interfere with you trying to learn Japanese and make learning it more difficult. You can read up on intereference theory in psychology. In this sense, Japanese seems very different compared to Western languages, so it shouldn't be a problem. 
Another thing is that learning languages might be special in some sense, but I believe this is usually true during developmental years in early childhood."

833,Is there a global temperature reconstruction going back 700 million years?,"Geologist here, though paleoclimate is nowhere near my specialization (I'm a structural field geologist). A quick google search delivered [this](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dujs/2010/05/30/oceans-of-ice-the-snowball-earth-theory-of-global-glaciation/) result, which is a really interesting review of the Snowball Earth theory circa 2010. The review has a solid set of references to check out and branch from. [This](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) is a good technical article on constraining Paleozoic temperature fluctuations. If you're stuck behind paywalls in your hunt for the references, try [this](https://libgen.is/) website; the search tool is not the best but it has helped me heaps over the years. Anna's Archives is another good site.

[This](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32075449) book is a great read. It doesn't zero in on the topic of paleoclimate; it discusses the six major extinction events that have punctuated life over the last 550M years, and the geological and extraterrestrial events that precipitated them. Excellent interviews and travel stories with paleontology and geology specialists, well written and entertaining. Also, it is great for providing a bit of a sense of scale for the amount of time we're dealing with - but even then, it covers only the most recent half a billion years of earth history.

As to global temperature trends during the Proterozoic and Archaean, the question kind of starts to lose relevance when we step that far back in time, in part because the data one needs are sparse at best, but also because planetary dynamics were almost unfathomably foreign. For example, a key thing to note is that the atmosphere, once it existed, had a completely different composition for the first two billion or so years of earth's history - see the Great Oxidation Event, [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23286-7) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/great-oxygenation-event). Discussion of paleoclimate dynamics is seated in a wildly different context - life in only its earliest, nascent states, very different global hydrodynamic systems, very different rates and processes of erosion. The earth itself was also hotter, internally - see komatiitic lavas, [here](https://www.alexstrekeisen.it/english/vulc/komatiites.php) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/komatiite), for example. And after the GOE, atmospheric composition continued to fluctuate; see [here](https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/01/03/which-came-first-complex-life-or-high-atmospheric-oxygen/). So objective climate temperature measurements can be derived, to a point, but consideration of their context matters very much as well.

What I'm driving at is that the scale of changes quickly grows beyond our conventional scope. We are (very justifiably) concerned with temperature fluctuations in the range of 2-4 degrees in the span of hundreds of years. In contrast, since the end of the [Proterozoic](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/GSA/timescale/home.aspx), global temperature trends have fluctuated by much larger ranges, by up to an [order of magnitude](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) larger, and these fluctuations took place on an earth that barely to eventually only kind of looked like the planet we're living on now. Stepping even further back, Earth's tectonic dynamics, atmospheric dynamics, hydrodynamics, magnetodynamics, everything was so different that the exercise of extrapolating temperature change kind of loses relevance. Discussion of temperature fluctuations that far back requires thoughtful meditation on the context in which those temperature fluctuations were occuring.

Just for fun, [this](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/3/4/220/31158/Tectonic-model-for-the-Proterozoic-growth-of-North) is a brilliant article on the evolution of the North American continent: it steps through time at the scale of accretion of the major tectonic components that make up the continent as we know it today. However, it is Critical to acknowledge that the model is presented always within the context of the geometry of the current continental structure, without consideration of their/its true location on the surface of the planet. All of these tectonic puzzle pieces were essentially drifting their way around the surface of the planet, both as independent pieces and later as coherent, accreted terranes. This is continuing today - tectonics is still very much active and the plates continue to drift across the surface. Point being, all of these tectonic puzzle pieces have existed at very different latitudes and longitudes throughout their existence, and the climate itself has also changed wildly throughout this history. It's kind of staggering to ponder the immensity of the difference of the planet's geology between then and now, let alone the life that geology hosted, and the climate that existed above."
834,Is the arid region on the NW corner of the Island of Hawai'i a rain shadow from Kohala or the result of human ranch & forestry management?,"Hi, I'm from a different island on Hawaii and I've driven this road many times. It's absolutely a rain shadow effect.  As you drive through Waimea town from east to west, the weather changes almost instantly from overcast and rainy to clear blue skies.  Here's a [rainfall map](http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/interactivemap.html): five miles east of Waimea, it rains 90 inches a year.  Five miles west, it's 20 inches a year.  By the time you get to the Kohala coast, it's cactus country.  And the Waipio Valley, the extra-green bit north of Waimea, gets like 150 inches a year.

There's definitely some land management in the area, some of the area east of Waimea is green and rainy but *not* forested, which in Hawaii is a sure sign that somebody's chopping trees, but the dramatic green-to-brown contrast you see in satellite photos is one of the most spectacular demonstrations of the rain shadow effect you'll ever see."
835,How do scientists perform controlled studies if the real medication has an obvious side effect that the placebo will not?,"That's the sort of thing you learn *during* human trials, not before.

837,Why did the black death “Go away” In Europe for the most part?,"The most important reason was implementation of quarantines that stopped the spread of the disease. Improvement in sanitation and personal hygiene during this period also helped. That being said, people died of the plague for centuries after the initial wave, but nothing like the first wave. Part of the reason might be that Yersinia pestis at this time was too deadly, and simply died out as a consequence. Additionally, some people developed immunity to the disease."
838,"How is Silver so electrically conductive, and yet non magnetic?","This is a physics question. Electric fields and magnetic fields are linked, but you are looking at the behavior of electrons in materials here. The conductivity depends on how well electrons can move across the material, while the magnetic properties depend on how the magnetic moment of electrons (from their spin and their orbitals) align. These are generally independent things.

Silver is diamagnetic, like many other elements. An external field will change the orientation of the magnetic moments of the electrons in silver, creating a weak opposing field. Copper, another excellent conductor, is diamagnetic as well.

In everyday use, ""magnetic"" usually refers to ferromagnetism, where the magnetic moments in the material will be aligned easily by an external field and point in the same direction (the material will be attracted by a magnet), and they can be aligned even in the absence of an external field, which means the material can be a permanent magnet. This is a very unusual condition and only a few pure elements show it, with iron being the most notable one. Usually we encounter iron as steel - some versions of it are ferromagnetic, others are not, it depends on the composition."
839,Is the statement that brain development is not finished until 25 true or false?,"Gray matter volume is maximum at 6 years old.

Total cerebrum volume is maximum at 13 years old. That's when you have the biggest volume of gray and white matter combined in your cerebrum (not including cerebellum and brainstem, but those are a lot smaller too).

White matter volume is maximum at 29 years. 

Whether the change from gray matter to white matter is always development and positive or sometime aging and negative is unknown yet. It's likely that as we age we lose some of our ability to learn by losing synapses but we are better at having more complex thoughts. 

The change from gray matter to white matter happens due to synapses dying and being replaced by longer connexion. Since synapses are where the computation happens, it makes that the brain gets less powerful after 6 years old in a computer sense, however the system is more fine tuned since the synapses have been optimized and it allows for more complex thought since different parts of the brain are more connected.

https://sharpbrains.com/blog/2022/04/26/collaborative-neuroimaging-initiative-brainchart-helps-chart-how-brains-change-across-the-lifespan

From 18 to 25, your brain size slightly decreases, your white matter slightly increases, and your gray master slightly decreases. Gray matter decreases mostly by the lost of synapses, it's then partially replaced by longer axons (white matter) and partially replaced by holes filled by fluid (ventricules). The loss of synapses is likely due to your brain fine-tuning itself, but it can also be due to aging that causes the synapses to stop working even if they were useful."
840,Is there evidence as to whether life has emerged multiple times on Earth?,"There is no reason to think that life didn't emerge multiple times on early Earth, but there is also no reason to think that it did. There's no evidence either way. One thing that is for sure is that all life on Earth *today* arose from a single lineage or organism (called LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor), because of the unity of, yes, the universal chirality of biomolecules but also the shared genetic code and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head. Since all modern life originated from a single ancestor, you can say that there's a veil of sorts that obscures history further back than LUCA. The database for the study of ancient life is the genomes we have at hand, and all of them are descendants of LUCA. But that doesn't mean there weren't other life forms before (or even after, I suppose) LUCA, but if there were they died out and left no evidence of their existence. There is simply no way to know what forms of life existed without genetic evidence that they existed.

To the best of my knowledge there is no particular advantage to D- versus L-chirality or the arrangement of genetic coding we have today. It is simply the way things formed -- evolution does not optimize that way.

One thing to keep in mind about origin of life research is that no one really knows that much. Researchers have pet hypotheses but they always reflect their own personal experiences and interests. For example, it's not that surprising that the inventor of the RNA World hypothesis -- a popular idea that suggests that RNA, a more chemically active cousin of DNA, was the first ""living"" biomolecule -- was Alex Rich, a lifelong RNA researcher. Its current biggest proponent is Jack Szostak, a guy who also spent most of his life studying RNA (and in part won a Nobel Prize for it). My experience is more in protein research and so I find hypotheses that incorporate proteins in the origin of life more compelling."
841,What is the average size of a four-month-old human heart?,"When our 11 month old was going in for heart surgery I asked a similar question. The surgeon said a fair estimate is the size of your heart is about the size of your clenched fist. He said this is more or less true for all people.  I closed my hand around my babies hand and folded it into a fist. I thought wow, you are going to fix broken bits inside something so small."
842,Is it true that a woman has a number of eggs and runs out after the age of fifty?,"Set number of eggs? Yes. But it's in the low millions. Far more than the number of months between menarche and menopause.

Rather, the eggs themselves accumulate damage, and the endocrine and hormonal system that prepares them for fertilization and gestation degrades over time. (Aging degrades everything, and fertility for women is one of the first casualties that can't be compensated for with, e.g., experience.)

So, no, she doesn't run out of *eggs*, exactly, but she does run out of ability to prepare and release fertile eggs. Which is an important difference, biologically, but may feel like a distinction without difference for someone struggling with fertility issues."
843,Why doesn’t the “ nerve ring” count as a Central Nervous System in Echinoderms?,"[It is referred to as the ""central nervous system"" in at least some scientific literature.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2015.00123/full)

Not only is the echinoderm nerve ring similar in function (in some ways) to the vertebrate CNS, but as fellow deuterostomes, echidnoderms (along with the hemichordates) are the closest living relatives of the chordates. So it shouldn't be too surprising to find [some shared structure and function between the two groups](https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-6-11), even though both modern echidnoderms and modern chordates are quite derived relative to whatever ancestor they once shared \~600 million years ago."

There are multiple valves which prevent water from getting into the lungs. Their blowholes can close up, there are valves in their trachea. It is very hard for water to get into their lungs in any significant quantity.

They can cough if needed. Whales with respiratory infections have been observed to cough. The mechanism is there."
847,What are the similarities between the beginning/cause of the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum era and now in terms of greenhouse gas levels?,"During PETM, the [CO₂ release is believed to have lasted roughly 50,000 years, averaging about 0.88 gigatons of CO₂ or CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e) per year.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5582631/) Collectively, this meant about 44,000 Gt CO₂e spread out over 50,000 years.

By contrast, in 2019 humans released 55 Gt CO₂e. Since 1850 [we have released an estimated 2,500 Gt CO₂e in total, heavily weighted towards the present.](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/)

849,"Taking potentially accidents to one side, do oil rigs act as ecological islands in a desert and actually add to the marine diversity local to the rig?","I think the term ecological island is a stretch, but oil rigs have the same local impact that other structures have in (relatively) deep water.  Things like navigation aids, boat hulls, floating debris.

There are a lot of organisms that prefer some cover to be near, and even more that are looking for a surface to attach to.

Rigs grow seaweed and barnacles, which attracts crustaceans and fish, crab etc.

So while there is a local benefit, it's not any different than any other object in the sea would generate."

851,How does sexual preference change throughout time? Are a person's sexual preferences influenced by biological or environmental factors?,"There seems to be some evidence to support the theory that the youngest male children in a large family are more likely to have same sex preferences, along with a theory this is an evolutionary adaptation.  There has also been some genetic evidence that support a same sex preference, however this appears to be elusive.  A more permissive environment and supportive family seem to be equally important however.

A change in sexual preference back and forth over time has often been noticed among people identifying as bisexual; sometimes referred to as their 'bi-cycle'.  In the [Klein Sexual Orientation Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_Sexual_Orientation_Grid) sexual attraction is a self-identified element in the past, present, and ideal, recognising that sexual preference may change over time."
852,"Why did the Chicxulub asteroid, the one that wiped out the dinosaurs, cause such wide-scale catastrophe and extinction for life on earth when there have been hundreds, if not hundreds of other similarly-sized or larger impacts that haven’t had that scale of destruction?","To start with, yes, Chicxulub sized impactors are common enough (on a geologic time scale) that we generally need to start looking for what made the Chicxulub impact special. Specifically, on average, Chicxulub sized impactors would be expected to hit Earth every 30-100 Myrs - with the 30 Myr recurrence end of the range probably more likely than the 100 Myr recurrence (e.g., [Grieve & Shoemaker, 1994](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xXWZolI9NkUC&oi=fnd&pg=PA417&ots=13R_A4bG_p&sig=UEFLjK_DgT1tS27BmgV7k12sAtk#v=onepage&q&f=false)), but there are not mass extinctions on the scale of the K-Pg with the same average rate of occurrence. The ""specialness"" of Chicxulub could be one of two things (or some combination of both):

1. **Location:** As discussed by [Kaiho & Oshima, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x), there's a broad idea that much of the ecological devastation caused by the Chicxulub impact came down to the rocks it hit, specifically a sulfur rich carbonate platform. At the time of impact, only ~13% of the Earth's surface contained similar rocks, so it's possible there would not have been an extinction if the Chicxulub impactor had hit any of the other 87% of the Earth surface. This also means that when considering the probability of an impact causing an extinction, we need to factor not just recurrence of a given sized impact, but also recurrence of a given sized impact hitting the right type of rocks. The role of location of the impact is considered more fully in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/kpg_impact_location/).
2. **Coincidence with Flood Basalts:** There's generally a vigorous debate about whether the impact or Deccan Traps volcanism was more important in the K-Pg extinction. This is discussed in more detail in another one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/k_pg_extinction_cause/), but one things that comes out of this is that there's a long-standing idea (bolstered by recent results) that neither the Deccan Traps or the Chicxulub impact were sufficient on their own to cause the extinction, but together, they could (e.g., [Petersen et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12079)). Thus, again, considering the probability, we have to think not just about the recurrence interval of a Chicxulub sized impactor, but the probability of a Chicxulub sized impactor hitting while a flood basalt is erupting (e.g., [White & Saunders, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002449370400310X)).

If we take both arguments at face value, we can start to see that even with a Chicxulub sized impact every 30 million years, in order for such an impact to actually cause a mass extinction it needs to potentially hit the right spot on Earth *and* at the same time as other climatic disruptions, like the eruptions of large igneous provinces. The probabilities (and thus expected average recurrence) of all of those together are significantly lower (i.e., longer average recurrence) than just the probability of a Chicxulub sized impactor hitting Earth."
853,Why are asteroid and comet orbits so different?,"Asteroids are mostly small rocky objects from the asteroid belt (between Mars and Jupiter, 5 astronomical units) to the Kuiper belt (a bit past Neptune, 30 astronomical units).  Up to these distances, they are more or less in the orbital plane of the Sun.

Comets come from the very distant Oort cloud (5000 to 50,000 astronomical units away), which at that point aren't necessarily constrained to the orbital plane of the sun and can come in from all directions."
854,in the John Carter of Mars series of books the author describes the transition from day to night happening very quickly because of the thin atmosphere. Is this accurate?,"No, it is the opposite.

Mars is a very dusty planet. Dust high in the atmosphere\* reflects and scatters sunlight well after sunset and before sunrise. As a result, twilight on Mars lasts up to two hours, *longer than* is typical for low-mid latitudes on Earth (i.e., polar twilight notwithstanding, but Mars has that, too). Volcanic ash can occasionally produce similar effects on Earth.

855,Does the perceived viscosity of water changed based on an organisms size?,"The concept you are working towards is what we call the Reynolds number, which is a ratio of inertial effects to viscous effects. A paramecium in water has essentially no inertia due to its microscopic size, while when we swim we have a very significant amount of inertia, much more so than viscous drag. This has a huge effect on how the organism can effectively move through water. A great paper/essay explaining how this specially affects organisms of different sizes is called [Life at Low Reynolds Number](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/purcell.pdf) by Nobel Laureate E. M. Purcell."
856,Will there be a lot more fossils in the future?,"Think about this. The number of fossils for most species is extremely few and most are incomplete. There are lots of exceptions to this. However, most creatures that lasted tens of millions of years, only have a few bits and pieces left even though many billions of individuals once existed.

The layer of soil we live on now will be compacted into a thin sliver. Most of it will likely be displaced and erode away. We don't know where the exceptions will be or if there will be any. There are big gaps in the geological record in many places due to ice ages.

Our biggest exceptions will likely be from deep mines. Any people or animals that got trapped in a collapse and never recovered, probably have a good chance of preservation, and eventual chance exposure due to erosion."
857,Does chronic low blood pressure lead to disease?,"To my knowledge low blood pressure as an essential diaease does not exist or is extremely rare. Too low perfusion does cause organ damage, but that is secondary to blood loss, cardiac failure or disease like Addison’s. There is some speculation that low blood pressure might increase the risk for normotensive glaucoma, but I have not seen research papers, just expert opinions.

Normal blood pressure for people in hunter-gatherer populations is around 90/60mmHg, so anything above that should be fine if it doesn’t cause lightheadedness or other symptoms.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammer_syndrome is one possible disease where blood pressure falls too low, but it’s not a clearly defined medical entity."

So, I think whether you can include it as a horn really depends on your perspective.

Do elephants have horns? They use them when fighting rivals or enemies. In that way their tusks act as horns. Walruses seem to be the same, though, in their case they act like long teeth.

I think you should understand the definitions or ""tusks"" and ""horns"" first. Then understand how narwhals use their tusks. With some creativity, you'll be able to argue they are exactly what you want them to be. It's probably nebulous enough that, with the right argument, no one can perfectly say you're wrong haha."

**Birth Control Pills Affect Women's Taste in Men**

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/birth-control-pills-affect-womens-taste/

“Studies suggest that females prefer the scent of males whose MHC genes differ from their own, a preference that has probably evolved because it helps offspring survive: couples with different MHC genes are less likely to be related to each other than couples with similar genes are, and their children are born with more varied MHC profiles and thus more robust immune systems.”

862,Are International Units for bioactive compounds subject to any ISO standard?,"No, but sort of yes, but mostly no.

It's a little bit like Russian nesting dolls.  Somewhere inside those dolls are rigorous test procedures but each subsequent claim is completely independent.

[International Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit) for bioactive compounds are used to compare the *effectiveness* of similar forms of the same substance.  For instance, comparing Vitamin A from supplier 1 versus supplier 2.

A standard assay is defined for that compound and everyone else uses the same technique and even same machines.  They find the ""best"" and most ""stable"" preparation and that is the International Standard for That Compound only.  All subsequent preparations are done using the same test and it's a percentage versus the ""best"" sample defined earlier.  

Insulin has a standard test method called *NIBSC code: 83/500*, which stands for *National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. World Health Organisation, 2nd International Standard: Insulin, Human.*  Reason for 2nd is the first standard was all used up and they needed to make a new reference batch.

[Insulin is a bioactive substance with a 1 IU insulin ≙ SI units of 0.0347 mg human insulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6501531/).  But insulin is a protein and can have different masses depending on the supplier and it can even change over time.  Hence, the need to compare *effectiveness* of any new or batch of insulin versus some standard reference insulin sample.

The main ISO standard is ISO 9001 or quality management.  Are you making what your procedures say you are, how do you define training procedures, do you have procedures to detect problems in your protocol.

Next is ISO 17025 or laboratory management.  Again, it's not a true empirical standard such as metres or Celsius, it's asking laboratories to prove they calibrate their machines, include statistical errors, are they able to prove they aren't forging data, etc."
863,Why does ice melting in Antarctica have more of an effect on coastlines further away?,"Without knowing the details of the story, I would guess that what they're alluding to is the influence of [post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound). In short, the crust in areas that were formerly covered by ice sheets (or thicker ice sheets) during the [last glacial maximum (LGM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum) were depressed by those ice sheets. Since the ice sheets melted, the crust has been rebounding, resulting in local uplift (and this is mostly reflecting a response to past melting with the current melting of Antarctica, and Greenland, contributing to future continued rebound). This in turn influences *relative sea level* in those locations. Global changes in the ocean level measured relative to a fixed datum are *eustatic sea level* variations. For example, if eustastic sea level is going up by 3 mm/yr, but the rocks that underlie the coastline in a particular location are rising by 5 mm/yr, then relative sea level in that location is actually going down by 2 mm/yr. 

More broadly, local effects can significantly vary how relative sea levels respond to eustatic sea level changes. If for example, an area is experiencing subsidence, this can exacerbate sea level rise (e.g., in some location instead there was a 3 mm/yr eustatic sea level rise, but with 2 mm/yr of subsidence, then the relative sea level change in that location would be a rise of 5 mm/yr). For example, subsidence along with eustatic sea level rise is generally exacerbating relative sea level rise in many places along the Gulf Coast of the US."
864,"Are there any mammalian viruses that look like bacteriophages (i.e. that have the ""lunar lander"" shell that injects its payload)? If not, why?","It is because mammalian cells have a lipid membrane. Viruses enter the cells by binding to a target molecule, and then entering the cell via endosome formation. Bacterial cells have “walls”of peptidoglycans that surround the lipid membrane. In order for the viral DNA to enter a bacterium, the virus has to “punch: through the cell wall to allow the DNA to enter the cell."
865,What is responsible for the smell of mushroom mycelium?,"Fungal colonies do their digestion primarily outside of their own cell walls. So their hyphae(cells) are constantly secreting enzymes into their surrounding environment- which break down biomass into all kinds of useful other stuff just like your stomach does.

So the substrate is saturated in glucose, proteins, alkaloids, ketones, terpenes,- many of which are actively undergoing some chemical reaction or decomposition- and can be quite volatile when exposed to open air. 

Tldr; their stomach contents are on the outside and you would smell similarly if yours was too."

868,Why was the earth so hot during the P-T Extinction Event?,"The Siberian Traps are a [flood basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt). Flood basalts generally erupt effusively as opposed to explosively, where the latter is necessary to inject aerosols high enough into the atmosphere to cause global cooling. Instead, flood basalts release a fair amount of CO2, which can contribute to global warming.

In the specific case of the Siberian Traps, it was not just that they erupted and released CO2 from the exsolution of gas within the lava, but also that they erupted through a large succession of very organic rich layer of rocks. The resulting contact metamorphism of these rocks released *a lot* of additional CO2, CH4, and a variety of other greenhouse gases that led to the extreme global warming at the P-T boundary (e.g., [Svensen et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X08007292), [Ogden & Sleep, 2011](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1118675109), [Black et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X11007151), [Grasby et al., 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1069), [Iacono-Merciano et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X1200547X), [Kui & Cump, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825214000750), [Burgess et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00083-9), etc.)"
869,Why do humans and birds share so many diseases?,"I don't know whether we truly share more disease with birds than with other animals, but I can shed some light into the question of ""compatibility.""

Most zoonotic diseases are caused by viruses, at least that's what we are familiar with, like influenza or SARS-CoV-2. The factors that allow a virus to ""jump"" from an animal to humans are not so much about anatomical similarity as the cellular similarity at a molecular level. Does the host cell have the right type of receptor for the virus to recognize and attach? Is the host cell membrane amenable to the virus to penetrate and inject its genome?

Take SARS-CoV-2 for example. It uses a receptor called ACE2 that are abundant in human lung cells to attach and infect. While COVID is wreaking havoc in humans, it also has been observed in other animals that have ACE2 receptors.

Once a virus infects a host cell, the rest is pretty simple and pretty universal in all animals: the host cell's replication machinery begins transcribing and translating the injected viral genome, producing viral proteins. These viral components self-assemble into new viral particles, burst out of the host cell, and infect more cells. What we call ""disease"" is a consequence of the host cell death and activation of immune system."
870,How do dogs not develop respiratory alkalosis when panting?,"Lung doctor here.

Dogs [do hyperventilate](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.01380.2005) when [they pant](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/y67-001), which can lead to respiratory alkalosis.

There are different levels of panting. At lower temperatures, the panting isn't as pronounced, and the amount of air moved is relatively small. Like the volume of air is 50 mL, and the volume of the airway is 100 mL. This airway volume is called anatomic dead space. It doesn't participate in gas exchange. In this case, there isn't any respiratory alkalosis.

However, if you agitate the air enough, the physiologic dead space will decrease. If the volume of air is 50 mL, but the dog is panting super fast, the air in the airway is mixing so much that there is increased gas exchange, and the dog will hyperventilate, which will result in respiratory alkalosis.

The ideal frequency of panting will depend on the resonant frequency of the respiratory system, so it is basically a function of the size of the animal.

In sick human patients, we used to use a mechanical ventilation mode called high frequency oscillatory ventilation, where we used tiny breath volumes much lower than anatomic dead space, and frequencies of 300-900 times a minute. It's the equivalent of panting. It was thought to protect the lung in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It fell out of favor after the [OSCILLATE trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215554), which was stopped early due to increased mortality. It's still used in kids. I think there was another study in kids that was going on but got derailed during COVID- I'm unsure of its current status. Anyway, in that mode of ventilation, you could definitely blow off carbon dioxide even though the tidal volume was less than the anatomic dead space.

When I teach this to students, I often use an analogy of someone lighting a scented candle in the corner of a room. It might take a few minutes for someone at the other end to smell it. But if there is a ton of agitation in the room, like fans or people moving around, you would likely smell it sooner."
871,"At the cellular level, what is the cause of endothelial dysfunction as we age?","Many many things. some include: Cellular senescence, atherosclerosis/calcifications (physical narrowing that won't improve with nitric oxide around), autonomic changes with age changing basal tone, shear stress (narrower vessels causing higher velocity flow which damages endothelium more easily), exposure to medications which might change vessel characteristics (eg chemotherapy wreaks havoc on blood vessels)."
872,Why does Australia not get many tornadoes?,"The US is the only country that has the proper topography to produce tornados with any regularity.  The Rockies push colder air to extreme elevations and that layer then covers the warmer air covering the great plains at lower elevations.  When the warmer air punches a small hole through the layer of cooler air, it rises unchecked creating the funnel cloud.

Without this ""layering"" some water spouts or small tornados are possible, just not real probable."
873,Would it be possible to cross breed sea plants and normal grass?,"You should be able to, but there are many extant species of grass with good to high salt tolerances, and even those that live and thrive in tidal marshes.

874,What is it about the Darien Gap that makes construction so difficult?,"It isn’t impossible; just impractical and expensive. There is little reason for a highway to exist there, except perhaps to complete a line on a map. An extensive national park exists in the way of the formerly planned road, and environmental concerns kept the road from being completed in the 1970s. Later efforts to complete the roadway ran into opposition from environmentalists and local native populations. Journeys through the area are generally done using boats (pirogues / piraguas) rather than foot. A ferry bypassing the area operated for awhile but eventually was shut down as unprofitable."

877,How does Parental Age affects the Probability of Having Healthy Offspring?,"Thoughts of a medical doctor here: 

There’s probably presentation bias in your summary. Women at advanced age are more likely to have health insurance, health care and seek care. Their pregnancies are likely more intentional. 

You’ll have less miscarriages at a younger age simply because you’ll have more abortions, and also because your miscarriages may be less frequent due to less birth defects that don’t carry to term, a driving force in the miscarriages as well. 

Young women are probably less likely to report miscarriages they had or get documented healthcare at all related to non-term/early  miscarriage pregnancy. 

Younger women’s bodies may also better clear miscarriages from the uterus without intervention and so never realize they were pregnant at all and just think they had an irregular or heavy menses. 

There are so many reasons for the variations in the statistics, but there are certainly statistically significant differences by age not explained simply by presentation bias. I was just pointing out a factor that might artificially distance the reported figures. 

It’s generally thought though that 1/5 to 1/4 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, not just in the older population. Older women may also be more inclined to carry a fetus with a known birth defect to term because of difficulty conceiving and desire to have a child."
878,"Physically, what makes a recessive gene recessive?","So, it's not the gene itself that's dominant or recessive - it's traits resulting from variations in that gene (different variations of a gene are called alleles). 

Genes typically encode a protein that has a specific function in the cell. For example, a gene might encode an enzyme that makes the pigment that makes eyes brown. Another allele of that gene might make a protein that is non-functional. If we have one copy of the functional gene, and one of the non-functional, pigment is still made and the eyes are still brown. So brown eyes are a dominant trait because you only need one copy of that allele. Blue eyes only happen when you have two non-functional copies and so no pigment is made at all.

Basically - in the majority of cases, recessive traits are those that result from an allele which has a loss of function, and dominant ones from an allele that is still working. In practice there are complications and exceptions to this, but that is the basic principle."
879,"How is it that bones lengthen without compromising their structural integrity during our first ~20-25 years (assuming sufficient dietary needs are met), but breaking a bone leads to loss of integrity, even during those same formative years?","Their structural integrity is highly compromised during growth.  The growth plate is the weakest part of the bone and thus the most fracture prone.  

The trade off for the ability to lengthen is a weak spot that can be more easily injured than can mature bone."
880,How is metal purified?,"It depends on the metal.  Turning bauxite into Alumina  using [The Bayer Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process) has both chemical and mechanical components.    
 Heat is used a lot. 

Some impurities have lower boiling point then the metal you are trying to refine and so smoke off. Metals are usually found in the oxidised form so you also need an electron donor, like carbon monoxide, in a [smelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting) ."
881,How do ant colonies circulate air?,"Ants don't really need that much of oxygen at all, only a tiny amount.  You could put a colony in a sealed jar and it would take months, if not years for them to exhaust the oxygen (assuming they had enough food and water).  Some species intentionally plug the entrances to their nest when faced with flooding, letting the colony survive on just the oxygen in the tunnels, then switching to anaerobic respiration, requiring no oxygen, to hold out for a bit longer.

That being said, RE: circulation, it's basically just natural circulation.  Since they're ""cold blooded"", they don't really generate much heat (and can easily just stop metabolizing if they need), but the small amount that they (and their larvae) do generate is probably more than enough to get micro-convention currents going, pulling fresh ever so slightly colder air down into tunnels, just enough for their oxygen needs."
882,"What is the ""Great Gulf"" of the Orion-Cygnus Arm?","Given the context, I think you may be conflating a couple of different things.  One is the ""Great Rift"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Rift_(astronomy)). This isn't actually a region of low density, but it appears to be because there are clouds of interstellar dust between us and the stars beyond the dust cloud that obscure them in the visible wavelengths. They're there, we just can't visually see them as well. These are stars within our galaxy. The other are the so-called [great] voids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy)). These are, indeed, regions where there genuinely is a much lower density of stars and other celestial objects, but they're much larger than galaxies or arms of galaxies.

In general, though, gravitationally bound systems like galaxies aren't rigid structures. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to talk about structural weakness because of gaps."
883,What is physically happening inside your sinuses when they crackle and open up from congestion?,"There are structures known as turbinates within the nose. Their purpose is to increase the surface area of olfactory cells and to induce turbulence in the air flow to improve air-olfactory contact. They are not boneless, but mobile, essentially like flappy meat curtains hanging inside your nasal cavity. These can become inflamed when experiencing illness or allergies, and they are also capable of moving side to side a bit. The sensation you feel is when a turbinate moves to unblock the nasal passage on one side. This is why laying down on your side often opens up the nostril that’s on top with respect to gravity. The clicking may be the sound of the turbinate disadhering from the sticky nasal cavity wall, but I’m not 100% certain on that.

Edited for accuracy."
884,Could you make gamma rays via Bremsstrahlung?,"Some of the other comments are about x and gamma rays and where they're from.

I want to discuss the energy range. The answer is ""yes"" l, one can make high-energy photons with Brem. This is, in fact, a common technique in nuclear physics to probe the response of nuclei to electromagnetic radiation. I do this myself at a facility called gammaELBE in Germany."
885,"If a current source is applied across a resistor (and only that resistor) and the resistor is part of an open voltage circuit, does the voltage drop across that resistor (caused by that current source) also affect the potential of the open circuit?","You can't have a constant-current source feeding an open circuit.  Since you're ramming charge into a place it can't escape, the voltage at point A will rise until either the source is unable to deliver constant current, or an electrical discharge completes the circuit.

It's like running a constant-flow pump into a sealed pipe: you're going to either break the pump or the pipe."
886,"We have heard about development of synthetic meats, but have there been any attempts to synthesize animal fat cells or bone marrow that might scale up for human consumption?","My time to shine. I'm in the industry.

Yes, all kinds of animals cells can be grown, the main issue facing the industry right now is efficient scaling up. Efficient as in money efficient.

The equipment it takes to produce grams right now cost in the range of several hundred Ks. We don't expect equipment prices to come down immediately, but perhaps in the next few years. The challenge is to produce kilograms in bigger equipment and then eventually tonnes.

Growing fat cells or muscle cells or stomach cells or intestine cells is just a matter of choosing which part of the original animal to biopsy from, and tweaking ingredients to suit what those cells like.

I don't know if any of our competitors are using stem cells, but we certainly aren't. The complexity involved in differentiating them correctly is not worth the time, plus we can't say if the specimen is healthy by using stem cells."
887,"When looking at the Hubble Deep Field or similar photos, how does a far away galaxy look at crisp, clear and bright as a galaxy in the forefront, much much closer?","With any camera there is a certain distance away from the lens where the focus is at ""infinity"" aka the farthest point at which adjustments to the focus will have an effect.

 Everything at, and beyond, that point will be in focus no matter how far away."
888,Why did the massive rainstorm yesterday only drop rain on Fort Lauderdale?,"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dennismersereau/2018/07/31/thunderstorm-training-can-turn-an-average-storm-into-a-flash-flood-emergency/?sh=3ee234bb7c57 

Meteorologist here! It’s called “training”. Basically a storm is slow moving and back builds on top of each other. This happens a lot when the flow is very weak, or you have multiple outflows (wind blowing in one direction) all converging on a central area. Also, these storms had precipitation water values. The higher the number, the more saturated the storm is and how much water it can dump. Hope this helps."
889,Native aluminium on Earth or other planets?,"Native aluminium [does exist on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_aluminium), though it's very, very rare. It's not clear to me at least that this rarity is due to biogenic oxygen the way native iron is, though - pure aluminium doesn't rust like iron does, and it just gets a transparent hard oxide layer on the outside. In fact, the aluminium you interact with on a regular basis is already coated in this oxide layer. So the fact that it's almost exclusively found in compounds in minerals is likely due to geological processes rather than biological, as I understand it."
890,Is there empirical evidence for the existence of the logical part of the mind and the emotional part of the mind?,"Yes and no.

We're aware of pathways and circuits in the brain that are related to emotional experience and also circuits related to conscious decision making.

The thing is that logic and emotion are complicated and involve multiple, often overlapping and intersecting parts. For example you have memory, sensory inputs, mood, executive override, regulation of body processes and many more parts contributing to the experience of ""emotion"".

Experiencing emotion does not involve just one part of the brain or even just one pathway.

You could make an extremely reductive and simplistic statement and say that logic is more related to outer structures of the cortices and emotion is more related to inner structures like the limbic system and basal ganglia, but this would be an incredible oversimplification. But I guess its a place to start if you are interested in neuro anatomy/physio."
891,What are the dangers of landfills other than methane emission and leachate?,"Former landfill engineer here.

Methane and other gas emissions are a problem,  but mostly asthetic. Unless it travels underground. Which it can. There have been cases where houses around landfills blow up due to methane accumulations in basements. 

Leachate can be a problem, especially with bioreactor type landfills that encourage organic waste decay. And leachate is a weird substance that has all kinds of constituents. And if leachate finds the right geology it can travel underground. 

Traffic in and around landfills can result in dust problems. Silica exposire and such. 

There is also biological hazard. Landfills often take sewage treatment sludge and slaughter house or roadkill waste. They can be a disease vector. 

One of the larger set of potential problems is in landfills that close (stop taking waste). Over time plastic liners break down, waste settles and compresses differentially. Slope failures, liner failures and cap failures can happen. Waste gets exposed to the surface and/or groundwater. And since nobody is making money from disposal, nobody is paying as much attention. 

Pests are sometimes a problem. Seagulls, rats, racoons, insects.  Landfill engineers have to consider  airport locations because of bird strike issues for instance. 

On a smaller scale, there are localized issues with climate and wind patterns and such. 

Blown debris is also a thing. Lighter stuff like paper, foam insulation, styrofoam packing material etc can get caught in the wind and go anywhere."
892,How do octopus change colour so fast?,"They have specialised cells that contain various coloured malleable protein masses connected to the cytoskeleton, they express a colour by stretching out the particular combination of coloured units required in the same way digital displays create colours using RGB. When the coloured units are relaxed they are small enough not to influence the visible colour. 

Quite how they know which colours to do and how they coordinate it is still in I'm pretty sure, but a large proportion of their big brain is dedicated to colour change.

Edit: one thing I didn't clarify well is that there's one pigment per cell and the cells are distributed evenly across the skin, rather than each cell containing every pigment. 

The cells are called chromatophores 

[here's a fun video of those cells in action](https://youtu.be/hNZ8Ui5Txbc)"
893,Why are liverworts considered plants but giant kelp isn't?,"What makes a plant, a plant?  You commonly hear people talk about ""tissue complexity"", but that's really just a rule of thumb and not the _actual_ definition of plants, and that's what's causing confusion here.  What _really_ defines a plant is two things: first, plants are a single monophyletic group, aka, they are a common ancestor and _all_ the descendants.  Second, this group is defined by sharing a particular method of reproduction.  I'll go through both of these and hopefully you can find some useful information for your class.  

So first, we'll just look at the relationship between plants and kelp.  [Here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169534719302575-gr1.jpg) is a tree of eukaryotic life.   It's not labeled, so I'll have to tell you where stuff is.  Plants are in ""Chloroplastida"" and kelp is way over in ""Stramenopila"".   These branches are not at all close to each other, and most of the other branches ""in between"" them are things which look absolutely nothing like plants...they are mostly single celled and many are not photosynthetic.   Indeed, both plants and kelp have become large, complex multicellular things independently.  And kelp even acquired photosynthesis differently...plants (and the green algae they came from) got photosynthesis by taking in photosynthetic bacteria.  Kelp (and the brown algae they came from) got photosynthesis by taking in _green algae_.  They are basically endosymbiotic turduckens.  So in short, these are two very different groups.

So if we can't simply use complexity or shape to define plants, what _does_ define them?  The key is in their proper name, Embryophyta.  Algae are aquatic and just let loose their eggs and sperm into the water, where the  eggs are fertilized and develop out in the open.  This is what kelp also do.  The key thing that plants do, and it's the thing that lets them be more successful on land, is to keep the egg inside the mother plant, in a protective structure called an archegonium.  In this structure it grows into a multicellular embryo.   In mosses and liverworts and ferns this grows into a specialized spore-producing structure.  In seed plants it grows into a seed embryo.  

So if you want to show the distinction, show their different locations on the tree of life (you can probably find a better labeled version than I did) and talk about how they photosynthesize differently and reproduce differently, but have come to similar shapes because that's just a good shape for being a large photosynthetic thing."
894,"How do we process sentences—word by word, in phrases/chunks, or in their entirety?","If we always waited until we had heard the whole sentence (which we wouldn’t always know unless there was some sort of convention like in telegrams/two-way radio: “Stop/Over”!) then “garden-path sentences” where we are surprised by the ending wouldn’t work. This explanation of those sentences has some more links/jumping off points for how we parse and process spoken language:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence"
895,Do Plants use electricity to send signals like nerves do in Animals?,"Not like nerves, no, though they do have some electrophysiological communication. It's much less specialized than neuronal signaling.

They also rely on a rich repertoire of hormonal signals. Some of their hormones can travel through the air, and facilitate communication between different plants. 

Others are more similar to ours, just transported in xylem and phloem instead of blood etc. Your perfect conical Christmas tree illustrates it well - the tip of the tree produces a hormone called auxin, which inhibits growth of side branches. The branches get longer as you go down the tree, because less of the auxin reaches those parts of the tree."
896,Is high current actually high electron speed?,"In a wire, the electron density is given by the material - there is one electron per proton to an extremely good approximation. You might have an electron extra or missing per quadrillion protons or so but that's not going to make a difference. A higher current means a faster average directed motion of the electrons, it doesn't change the density of electrons.

If you are looking at electron beams in vacuum then you could absolutely have a different electron density, it will depend on the setup."
897,Why don't fluorophores have quantized emission spectra?,"Someone else will probably answer this more accurately, but until then: While it is true that the emitted photons' energy is from discrete energy levels, these energy levels depend not only on molecule architecture, but also on the direct interactions with the surrounding molecules/medium. That results in multiple rotational/vibrational states around the energy states, resulting in lots of different transitions."
898,Why is there an inverse relationship between charge carrier mobility and band gap in semiconductors?,"The average speed of a carrier can be roughly modeled by how much ""collisions"" it encounters when moving in response to an electric field.  The more collisions an electron encounters, the slower it's average speed. A higher bandgap means fewer bands for a given electron energy giving it ""less room"" to travel.  This increases the collision rate, and reduces the speed and increases it's resistance."
899,What defines the eras and periods of the Archean and Proterozoic eras?,"[The Archean specifically is defined chronometrically rather than stratiographically](https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf). Basically, geologists (via the International Commission on Stratigraphy) picked two absolute dates and said ""everything from 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago is defined as the Archean."" And this applies to the Archean's relatively even subdivisons into 300 or 400 million year intervals...it was really just arbitrary.

The first two eras of the Proterozoic are also chronometrically defined and fairly evenly divided. The third era (the Neoproterozoic) is where we start to break from this chronometric dating pattern. The Tonian starts out as another relatively even chronometrically division, but its ending (while still formally *defined* chronometrically) is intended to be roughly when evidence of widespread glaciation appears in the geologic record. This gives way to the aptly named ""Cryogenian"", the second division of the Neoproterozoic...[still defined by chronometric dating, but intended to represent the ""snowball earth"" period of Earth's history](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79519052.pdf). After the glaciers retreated and the planet warmed, [the Ediacaran reflects the first widespread appearance of multicellular life](https://stratigraphy.org/gssps/files/ediacaran.pdf).

And the Ediacaran ends, of course, where the Paleozoic's Cambrian period begins....which like the Ediacaran before it, was *also* intended to reflect the appearance of multicellular life, as [the Cambrian was the first (then) known appearance of trilobites in the fossil record](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/SP448.10).

So both the Ediacaran *and* the Cambrian were periods created to represent the emergence of multicellular life, but the Ediacaran benefits from a much fuller understanding of the global fossil record than we had when defining the Cambrian."
900,What exactly are magnetic lines of flux?,"The fields are continuous. The field lines are better thought of as similar to 'contour' lines on a map. The hills don't suddenly stair step up at each line, but where the lines are densest is where the contour changes the fastest, aka the steepest parts. 

'Flux' is 'change' so 'flux density' is how fast the field changes from point to point, aka how 'steep' the field is. 

When you see lines in iron filings, it's because the field itself likes pushing through iron more than it likes pushing through air or vacuum. So the flux lines 'bunch up' and pull the filings along with them as they seek the minimum energy configuration between moving through the easier path or the shorter path."
901,Has the success of transformers and LLM informed or advanced neuroscience in any meaningful way?,"To my knowledge, no. The (very) recent success of Chatgpt4 and the Transformer by Google Brain haven't had any applications to neuroscience in a meaningful way.

Since the early 80's, neuroscience has influenced the development of machine learning and AI far more than the other way around (1,2). We've understood the molecular basis for neuronal interactions for quite a while now. We also have a very robust understanding of *how* neurons interact with other neurons. This might seem surprising because we're used to looking at the brain through a lens of ""one can barely scratch the surface of this enigma, so we basically know nothing about the human mind"". Which isn't totally wrong, but it's misleading. We know quite a bit, but it's very difficult to causally associate the complexity of human behavior and thought with any part or parts of the brain.

But let's look at what ""transformers"" are in terms of AI and compare that to what our brain actually does. According to the [paper itself](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf), the Transformer developed by Google Brain can train itself faster than any recurrent model that we have right now. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is basically the standard, developed using the human brain as a model. The RNN cannot process all inputs at once; instead, it proccesses information in a sequence of steps. For long sequences, the ability to retain information from the first elements is lost when new elements were incorporated into the sequence. If the decoder only accesses the last hidden state of the decoder, it will lose relevant information about the first elements of the sequence (3). [This is in fact more similar to how our brains work. Our neurons are connected to one another in a sequential, though not necessarily linear, fashion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110878). One neuron does not connect to all other neurons and share information them at once. I honestly cannot even comprehend how a person's brain could process information like that.

But Transformers DO process the entire input all at once. That's what makes them so revolutionary. It uses something called an Attention mechanism, which lets a model draw from the state at any preceding point along the sequence. Our brain cannot do this the way a Transformer can. In a sense, the recent and rapid developments in LLM have actually ""broken free"" of neuroscience, since the human brain is no longer a golden standard.

Still, I haven't seen any evidence that human consciousness or the study of the human brain is being effected by LLM. I'm actually not able to find even one paper that suggests this. But I'd be really interested if anyone else can find a paper which talks about this topic.

Edit: I forgot to address your question about IIT vs Global Workspace. I personally never heard of either of these concepts before now. Seems like they are discussed/debated by a small group of neuroscientists. So I don't feel qualified enough to answer this, but anyone else should definitely chime in."
902,Were the gas giants originally thought to be terrestrial like Earth? When were the gas giants known to be gaseous?,"Looking at my encyclopedia from 1887,* they knew its density was much lower than earths .  They calculate jupiter at 338 times the mass of earth when today we believe 317.*  They also thought its size was 1400 times earths, today we say greater than 1300.*  They dont mention what the think it is made of but I think they could deduce it was not like earth.  Google give the answer as in 1930s the gas giant proposal was put forth.  But I have no supporting proof.

903,Why are cesium atoms used in atomic clocks?,"You want an element that you can prepare as isolated atoms, with a hyperfine transition that is strong enough to measure but also relatively long-living so it produces a narrow signal. For the clocks in the 1950s it had to be in the microwave range so electronics could follow it.

In addition, the resonance frequency shouldn't depend too strongly on external electric and magnetic fields. While you cannot avoid that dependence completely, you can measure the magnetic field directly together with the main clock measurement by observing other transitions that are affected more.

Here is a publication discussing caesium as time standard: https://www.nature.com/articles/176280a0

Today we can use transitions in the optical range (i.e. a much higher frequency), which allows more precise measurements. It has been proposed to redefine the second accordingly."
904,"Ask Anything Wednesday - Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology","I've got a question about how ants specialise!

905,What might night sky have looked like 4½ billion years ago ?,"Hi!  This is somewhat impossible to answer, because stars in our Milky Way have moved around so much- it takes about 230 million years for the sun to orbit our Milky Way once, so we've done it ~20 times since 4.5 billion years ago.  That means all the stars near us then are long ago gone, though there are some astronomers looking to find our long lost siblings via a lot of orbital dynamics and astrochemistry (I actually wrote an article for Astronomy magazine at some point about this, [here!](https://astronomy.com/magazine/news/2020/07/the-suns-lost-siblings)).

One thing I *can* tell you is 4.5 billion years ago when the sun was young, we hadn't had time to drift too far from the home nebula where our sun and hundreds (perhaps thousands) of other stars were born.  We can actually see examples of what I'm talking about in our own night sky- most of the stars that make up the Big Dipper are actually part of the [Ursa Major moving group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major_moving_group), where the stars are all about 300 million years old and have moved about 80 light years from the home cluster/nebula region.  At 4.5 billion years old, though, probably a better example is the [Pleiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades), where the stars are ~100 million years old and probably have another few hundred million years before they completely dissapate.

So, why do I bring this up?  Because our sun undoubtedly hung out with its own stellar siblings in the time period we are talking about, as it isn't enough time to dissipate- some would be bigger stars, some smaller, but there would unquestionably be a much more dense stellar neighborhood than what the Sun's area looks like today.  So what you'd see with your eyes are, indeed, more bright, young stars- how many is hard to say, but they would certainly dominate.

Hope this is helpful!"
906,Is it possible for so much land to erode away that the earth will only be left with oceans?,"As long as we have plate tectonics, new mountains forming, then we'll always have some land surface, even under the assumption that the ocean level will stay roughly the same (200m is a reasonable buffer).

Once plate tectonics stop, only then will your argument be reasonable, but then it's over a long enough term that the idea of ocean level staying the same will likely fail (in 1-1.5 bln years oceans will fully evaporate from the increased Sun output -- could be slightly later than that but it will happen at some point).

So while in the end much of today's land could well erode away into an ocean, there's always new land from new mountains."
907,You never see green in a sunset. There are also no green stars. Are these two facts related?,"The radiated energy of a body depends on temperature.  In the simple black body radiation model there is a range of frequencies in a bell curve (like) shape.  As the temperature increases, (1) the central peak energy wavelength gets shorter so the photons have more energy, and (2) the total energy output increase so the the number of photons increases.  The bell curve moves to shorter wavelengths and gets bigger.

A higher temperature star will look blue to humans, a lower temperature star will look redder.   Our Sun is in the middle so it's light is white.  This isn't a happy accident: our eyes have evolved here and are tuned to the available light.  If we evolved near a lower temperature star, our earth-human red might appear white/neutral and we might see into the infra-red electromagnetic region.

Green plants are a little weird. They use sunlight, but don't use all frequencies equally.  They tend to bounce out photons in the the central region of the spectrum, which is paradoxically at the energy peak.  That's photons that we see as green, so this rejected light makes leaves look green to us.

The reason plants reject green which is the peak energy has been a mystery for a long time but has been worked out recently.  Plants need to be extract energy in a low light conditions like cloud cover to survive.  However, they also need to ""make hay while the sun shines"" ie to work when the available energy is high.  This intense energy risks overloading chemical systems.  Their trick is reject the peak energy wavelengths, ie, green.  This keeps their systems stable in both high and low light conditions.    Life goes on.

Getting back to stars, the wavelength mix that we see as green is not a black body color.  Green is white incident light with the central green area bumped up.  That's why there are no green stars: they are white.  Green light is a survival trick by plants, not a color of stars.

\[edit, missed part of the question\] And the reason sunset is red is that the light has to pass through a lot of atmosphere to reach us at sunset.  The red light tends to make it through and the blue higher energy photons tend to get scattered sideways so less make the distance.  That's not really related to star colors."
908,Does nature ever select for mutations that then increase the chances of future mutations?,"There are several enzymes involved in the detection and repair of DNA damage. The efficiency and fidelity of these systems can vary. The mutation rate itself is thereby under genetic control. So yes, some organisms mutate faster than others."
909,How exactly is COPD coorelated to asthma and smoking?,"Smoking is the #1 cause of COPD, as it causes chronic irritation in the lungs, which leads to alveoli getting damaged and mucus plugging. Instead of having lots of good working air sacs and a rubbery lung that expels air well, you get fewer big air sacs and a flabby lung that doesn't breathe out well.

Asthma is an issue of reversible airway constriction, which is to say if someone has asthma, their lungs look healthy when they're not having an attack, unlike COPD. Normally it's just a different problem that you don't need to worry about, though some people do have conditions where features of asthma and COPD overlap."
910,Why don't humans take preventative medicine for tick-borne illnesses like animals do?,"There's a Lyme Disease vaccine that's now in phase 3 of human trials, and a ""pre-exposure prophylaxis"" drug is about to start human trials; so I expect we'll see something before long.

911,"How are coelecanths today the same as coelecanths 400MYA, but humans 400MYA were bony fish?","Evolution happens when you face evolutionary pressures.

912,What are the names of the machines used to make recombinant vaccines?,"The process to manufacture any vaccines is complex, consists of multiple steps. While there is a general workflow for production, a templated approach for manufacturing does not exist

But the start is always in bioreactor. Then the purification and other operations follow. While Microfuidics are great in getting say LNP, they are not a core for the process in vaccines. The manufacturers are many, also as machines required, but this depends on the process used quite widely."
913,Why gravity decreases with depth?,"It doesn't always, with reference to the Earth at least, it actually increases first and then begins to decrease. When considering gravity as a function of depth for the Earth, we often use the PREM (Preliminary Reference Earth Model), which suggests that gravitational acceleration actually increases until the core-mantle boundary, before starting to decrease, but not linearly, e.g., [this figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_reference_Earth_model#/media/File:EarthGravityPREM.jpg). 

The key concept here is the [shell theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem), which basically suggests that if you have a spherical object of radius X, at a depth Y, the gravitational acceleration will reflect only the influence of the mass of the object below depth Y (so effectively for a sphere of radius X-Y) because influence of the mass above depth Y is cancelled out. What begins to be important then is the distribution of mass, i.e., the density of the material within the sphere and how that's arranged. If the sphere had a constant density, then you would expect gravitational acceleration to uniformly decrease as a function of depth (and you can see this as one of the lines in the PREM figure from above). For Earth though, generally density increases with depth and does so very non-uniformly (e.g., [this model of density with depth, which is also part of PREM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth#/media/File:RadialDensityPREM.jpg)).

If we put those two together, i.e., the shell theorem and the density changes with depth, what this implies is that as you get deeper, at first the increase in the average density of the shells ""below"" you compared to the average density of the shells ""above"" you results in an increase in gravitational acceleration. Once you get to the core-mantle boundary though, while density still increases with depth, it does so more consistently and over a narrower range (and you're broadly in the highest density portion of the planet) so now gravitational acceleration begins to decrease as there is less and less mass in the shells ""below"" you.

An obvious caveat is that PREM is a model (it's right there in the name) and assumes (1) the Earth is a perfect sphere (it's not, it's a lumpy oblate spheroid) and (2) density contrasts are perfectly radial (they're not, there are definitely contrasts in density within radial ""shells""), but it's a much better approximation than either assuming a constant density or something like a linear increase in density. Also, obviously this is the model for Earth. If we wanted to consider another planetary body, we'd have to update it to whatever the correct change in density with depth would be, but the shell theorem would still apply. If our hypothetical body was closer to a constant density, then you would expect generally gravitational acceleration to decrease with depth everywhere throughout it."
914,"I know that analyzing facial microexpressions is kinda associated with pseudoscience, right? But like, is there any legit research on this topic? If anyone knows of some good authors or journals, give me a suggestion! Thanks!","Microexpressions are definitely real. What seems not to be real is the idea that there is any context-free mapping between facial expressions and emotions or intentions. In fact, at least according to the last lit review I read about this, there is no simple mapping between facial expressions and emotions. I know this violates a lot of people’s intuition and some previous research, especially by Paul Ekman, but it is the current state of the science nevertheless."
915,Do anti-fungals such as fluconazole become less effective with overuse like antibiotics do? Or less effective with repeated use in the same person?,"Yes, fungi can evolve resistance to antifungal agents just as bacteria can evolve resistance to antibiotics. One of the problems with Candida auris is that it’s resistant to a lot of antifungal agents, making infections difficult to treat.

Some antifungal agents, such as ketoconazole, stimulate the liver to alter levels of enzyme production. This can impact how long some other medications last in the bloodstream and thereby shorten their duration of action, rendering them less effective (or prolong their action, raising risk of accumulation and side effects). This property is not unique to antifungals; other medications, and even naturally occurring substances found in grapefruit, among other things, can alter the liver’s metabolic processing characteristics.

However, I don’t think any anti fungal agents stimulate their own metabolism and limit their own efficacy…but a pharmacist might correct me. Certainly, if you take a high enough dose to cause acute liver failure, that will alter medication metabolism. But if that happens, you’ve got bigger problems."
916,What is the first euarchontoglire in the fossil record?,"[Five *Purgatorius* molars were discovered at Harley's Point in NE Montana, USA](https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/02/24/earliest-primate-fossils/). Two of these molars were a match to *Purgatorius janisae*, which was already known from younger strata. One molar was distinct enough that it was assigned to a new species, *Purgatorius mckeeveri*, and two other molars found at the site were tentatively assigned to that new species as well.

What made these teeth particularly notable was that [they were extremely close to the K/Pg boundary, maybe 105–139 thousand years after the Chixulub impactor](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210050). This meant that these two *Purgatorius* species were the earliest-known fossil primates (and, indeed, the earliest euarchonts of any kind) found to date, and their proximity to the Cretaceous extinction line meant that the entire lineage almost certainly evolved in the Cretaceous."
917,Do set methodologies exist for “rolling back the clock” so to speak for a given land type/area? Or does a new evaluation have to take place for every particular land area?,"> are there set rules one could follow about how rivers erode land, how quickly large boulders move down a mountain, and how the land generally changes shape due to soil deposition?

Yes, but there are not *single* rules. Rather we have developed a variety of *process equations*, i.e., mathematical expressions that *approximate* the behavior of different systems, for things like erosion in rivers or transport of materials on a hillslope or deposition. The trick for all of these, you have to determine not only the right values for parameters within these, but also the appropriate process equation. That last question, is effectively asking, ""What aspects of a given process are actually important to simulate in my area to get close to the right answer."" To make this last point more clear, let's consider the example of trying to ""roll back the clock"" for river erosion. 

For erosion in bedrock rivers, one of the most common (and simplest) process equations for erosion is the so-called stream power equation where erosion (*E*) is given as:

    E = K x A^(m) x S^(n)
and *K* is a constant encapsulating details of the erodibility of rocks but also climate (basically average precipitation, so we could break K in something like *K-lithology* and *Runoff ^(m)*), *A* is drainage area, *S* is slope, and *m* and *n* are constants related to some details of how bedrock is eroding within the rivers and how the discharge scales with drainage are in the river. There are definitely examples of people using this form of an erosion equation to ""invert"" river profiles in an attempt to both determine what the forcings were (e.g., what was the uplift rate), but also theoretically to reconstruct what the landscape looked like (e.g., [Roberts et al., 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012TC003107), [Fox et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JF003196), [Goren et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JF003079)), [Rudge et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JF003297), etc.). These are usually hyper simplified in that they set *n* equal to 1 to make the math simpler (even though we generally think this exponent should be closer to 2 if you're assuming this simple stream power equation, e.g., [Lague, 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.3462)).

Now, the above stream power equation makes a lot of assumptions. For example, that (1) erodibility and precipitation are constant in space and time and (2) that any amount of water flowing over the bed does erosion. But this means that to ""invert"" you only need to make some assumptions about the erodibility and average precip and assume that drainage area has stayed fixed. The question are these reasonable assumptions? For point 2, in many places we think that there is a threshold to erosion, i.e., only a given portion of the stream power represented by the original equation actually erodes the bed, specifically only the part above a threshold (*Psi*), such that:

    E = K x A^(m) x S^(n) - Psi
So now we might need to characterize *Psi*, but this is still assuming it's constant, when in fact it might vary with rock type and/or erosion rate (e.g., [Shobe et al., 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2017JF004575), [Shobe et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282522100218X)). For point 1 from above, this assumes that river discharge is always constant and is the same as the average, but river discharge varies with time, effectively representing a distribution of river discharge or runoff, such that we maybe need to include a the probability distribution of runoff in our equation (*pdf(R)*) such that:

    E= K-lith x (pdf(R) x A)^(m) x S^(n) - Psi
that we would actually need to integrate across the possible range within *pdf(R)* and we end up accounting for that not only is there a threshold for erosion, but that not all flows will overcome this threshold. We could keep going and at this point we haven't even touched things like variability in lithology, temporal changes in the distribution of runoff, or the role of sediment within streams, among other very important details. Similarly, we haven't touched on the aspect that estimating some of these parameters is *very hard* and will effectively be different across different landscapes (e.g., *K*). We could similarly think about how much complexity we want to or need to include in the way we represent hillslopes, e.g., do we consider hillslope sediment transport to linear or nonlinear and/or with or without a limiting gradient (e.g., [Roering et al., 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2001JB000323), [Roering et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X07006061)).

A great example of asking your question in a more formal way (and considering many, but not all, of the above options) comes in a trilogy of papers published a few years ago (e.g., [Barnhart et al., 2020a](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JF004961), [Barnhart et al., 2020b](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JF004963), [Barnhart et al., 2020c](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JF005287)). In these papers, the authors took a location where they had a reasonable constraint on what the landscape looked like in the past (basically, there's been an incision event into a relatively smooth set of surfaces that started at a known time) and they systematically test which parameters or forms of different fluvial erosion and hillslope transport equations are needed to reproduce the modern topography. There is a lot of nuance (why it's spread across three papers), and their answer is not necessarily global, but it highlights that you need to consider both values of individual parameters but also which way to represent processes to be able to go about trying to answer a question like this.

**TL;DR** We (geomorphologists) have developed a variety of mathematical expressions to describe erosion and sediment transport, but they are non-unique, i.e., we have different ways of representing the same global process, e.g., fluvial erosion. The level of complexity varies between them (and thus the number of parameters needed but also the accuracy of the results) so it's not necessarily a straightforward task to ""roll back the clock."" That being said, you can (and people do) pick one of the simpler versions and try to use these expressions to ""invert"" for the past form of the landscape. It's challenging to test whether their answers are correct in most cases, but there are methodologies to try to assess the accuracy of these inversions."
918,Why do city pigeons so often have mutilated feet?,"Hi, I'm a wildlife veterinarian in a huge metropolitan areas. Because of their natural history, pigeons spend a huge amount of time walking, rather than perching or hopping compared with other birds. Since they're in cities, they tend to gather string materials around their toes, most commonly human hair in my experience but sometimes textiles and synthetic fibers. They get all tangled and knotted, and they aren't able to untangle it. Pigeon toe amputations are the most common surgery I do, but we're lucky they do so well with so few toes."
919,"Why are there so many pre-modern human fossils from the past several million years, but very few pre-modern chimp or gorilla ones?","Edit: I misunderstood the question. One speculation for the decreased number of chimp fossils is the environment of jungle (chimp/gorilla) vs. savannah (human) being less conducive for fossilization.


~~The premise is incorrect.~~ We have fossil evidence for several prehistoric non-human apes and other primates They just don't get the notoriety as protohuman fossils.

Dryopithecus is a prehistoric ape, likely related to orangutans or African apes, although it could be related to humans, as it existed around the same time as gorillas split off.

Gigantopithecus was once thought to related to human, but is now thought to be related to orangutans.

Megaladapis is a prehistoric giant lemur (not an ape) but it died out in the past 10,000 years.

Archaeoindris is a gorilla sized lemur that went extinct around 2000 years ago.  There's a ton of prehistoric lemurs.

Afropithecus is another African ape predecessor.

Mesopithecus and Oreopithecus are European ape ancestors, although they probably died out, since there aren't modern European apes (besides humans).

Anything too old becomes hard to differentiate between protohuman and protoape. Chimps split off around 5 million years ago, and gorillas split off maybe 8 million years ago."

This thrown off, decompressing degenerate neutron star matter initiates what is called the ""[r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process)"" or ""rapid neutron-capture process"" which is pretty much the only way atoms bigger than Iron are forged.

923,Can we selectively breed cows to produce less methane?,"This is actually an area of active research: [Breeding Planet-Friendly Cattle](https://www.ed.ac.uk/impact/research/futureproofing-societies-planet/breeding-planet-friendly-cattle)

Summary: A team led by Alireza Ehsani, a Marie Curie Fellow, is using data and genetics to breed cattle that produce less methane and utilize feed more efficiently. The collaboration with Norway-based global cattle breeding association Geno will simulate 500,000 animals, providing industry credibility. By optimizing feed efficiency and reducing methane emissions, this research could have a significant impact on agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions, which account for about 14.5% of the global total.

Selective breeding and genetic modification are both very slow and expensive processes, so researchers are also experimenting with special feed and additives that can reduce methane emissions.

Some examples:

* [Carbon Farming: Reducing Methane Emissions in Cattle Using Feed Additives](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/climate-change/carbon-farming-reducing-methane-emissions-cattle-using-feed-additives)

2.) Consider sites like the savanna river site exist and are staffed to produce things like Tritium that is needed for warheads. 

3.) Consider sites like the Panex plant in texas exist to make components for nuclear bombs. 

4.) Consider the personnel and support staff and security staff needed to maintain and control access to secure sites.

But if you grow one side faster than the other, you get a curve.  The bigger the discrepancy, the tighter the curve, until you get a tight spiral.  Now add a ""bias"" in, so that you not only curve, but shift to the right or left as you do.  Boom, conical snail shell.  All of these various shapes are just the product of a few parameters about growth rates varying."

Some species are much more tolerant tho, and several can survive 96% ethyl alcohol actually. But that is more because the alcohol basically denatures the cell wall and creates a hard shell before it can dehydrate the cell."
928,How did/do we classify poisonous food/chemicals?,"You can basically do the same thing as you would with some questionable old food in your fridge.


You can smell things, and if they smell bad, then don't eat them. If they pass the sniff test, you can taste a small bit on your tongue, and if it tastes bad, you can spit it out. If it tastes okay, then you can try eating a very small amount, see if it makes you vomit or gives you diarrhea, or otherwise makes you ill. If it doesn't, you can ramp up the quantity eaten slowly.


 It sounds kinda barbaric, but nasty smells, bitter tastes, vomitting, and diarrhea are your bodies natural way of detecting and getting rid of toxins. Plus, most conventionally toxic stuff in nature isn't so crazy dangerous that a small nibble will outright kill a healthy adult.


Even highly toxic plants like deadly nightshade aren't going to flat out kill someone who weighs 70+ kg if you just eat like half a berry."
929,How does Naegleria Fowleri defeat the immune system and why can it?,"Basically, [PAM](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html) needs physical penetration through the nasal mucosa (it does possess some enzymes to help facilitate entry) to reach the olfactory nerves. These nerves of course are open to the environment so anything that can gain access will be able to enter into an [immune privileged area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege) and be shielded from the immune system. From there, it simply devastates the cribriform plate and then the brain itself. Typically, we don't even know what it is until the patient is already dead.

According to [this abstract](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL096214) this includes radio waves and microwaves in the range of 0.03 to 3 GHz.

This is sort of a metric for taste, however, different animals may have specialised taste buds. Take dogs for example, they have specialised taste buds for tasting water, while humans don't. Therefore, animals may taste things differently to humans, so it's not really a direct comparison when talking about other species."

Pure water contains no nutrients or calories for bacteria to feed off of, for instance, neither does water ever spontaneously split into hydrogen and oxygen - that requires substantial energy input.
However, water is a rather powerful solvent, especially over long periods.  Many minerals and nutrients, including those of which many commonly used containers are made, will readily dissolve into it, thus rendering the water impure.
If kept in a perfectly non-soluble and airtight container - that is, if kept away from literally anything it could possibly ever react with, it should remain pure and unspoiled forever."

938,When did people work out the mass of the Sun with reasonable precision?,"The mass of the Sun was first estimated by Newton in his Principia Mathematica (1687). What he actually computed was the ratio of the Sun to Earth mass as this does not require any estimate of the gravitational constant. This was later improved in Principia (1713/1726) to correct errors he introduced the first time. His estimate by this point was within only a factor of two of the modern value while his original prediction was a factor of 10 out. This was all simply done using Newton's newly formed universal law of gravitation and is regarded as the first accurate estimates for the mass of the Sun.

Lets get into composition a bit because the dates may surprise people a bit with quite how modern Solar astrophysics is (despite the fact it can be dated back to [800 BC](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-0-387-92790-9) with the first observations of sunspots)! The big leap in knowlage started in 1802 with the start of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy), the observation by [William Hyde Wollaston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hyde_Wollaston) of black lines in the spectrum of light emitted by the Sun, however, William did not seem overly interested in this and indeed did not pursue it more. 16 years later the black lines were rediscovered by [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer) and it was now recognised that spectroscopy could inform us on properties it the solar atmosphere. It took quite some time before this really took off and a number of people were involved but perhaps the next big leap was in the 1850s by [Robert Wilhelm Bunsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen) (of the Bunsen burner) and [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff) who were able to determine a large number of chemical elements that make up the Sun. However, at the time they did not know the abundances of any of these elements and the elements discovered were the same that make up the Earth. Interestingly, helium was not one of the elements observed, in fact, at the time helium was not even a known element. It was actually discovered by spectroscopy of the [Sun in 1868](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium#Scientific_discoveries). 

&nbsp;

At this point, and until 1929, the Sun and all other stars were assumed to have the same chemical composition as the Earth. So it is less odd than you might think because it was based on simply what elements were present in the Sun and noticing that this is the same as Earth. However, by 1870 it was clear the Sun was not just a massive Earth like object as [Jonathan H. Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Homer_Lane) began working on the internal structure of the Sun by making the assumption that the Sun was in gaseous form and in [hydrostatic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium). Work on the internal structure continued (and still continues to this day) by the likes of [Robert Emden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Emden) and [Arthur Stanley Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington) and lay the foundations for what we understand of stellar structure in Eddington's 1926 book [The Internal Constitution of the Stars](https://www.nature.com/articles/106014a0). It was not until 1929 in the [PhD thesis](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1925PhDT.........1P) of [Cecilia H. Payne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin) determined that the most abundant chemical in the Sun was hydrogen followed by helium and both of these were far more abundant than anything else.

There are also often visual indicators such as the unique clouds that form in the same conditions that tornados do which can help warn people. Most people who are aware of what to look for will have no problems recognizing tornado weather. 

For someone who knew nothing about tornados, how they form and was completely unaware, I don't see why their subconscious wouldn't be able to recognize the dangers and manifest a feeling of anxiety or fear to motivate that person to get safe.  I wouldn't assume it was some kind of super power, and I also wouldn't assume any sort of reliability around using such a feeling to predict the weather if you or others were at risk. I mean it wouldn't be any more reliable then any other phobia the protects people, for example a fear of snakes. Sure its right every time that it's a snake, but is it a venomous snake?

Instead larvae (for lymphatic filariasis) migrate to the mosquito wing muscle, invade cells, and develop twice more to become infectious L3 stage worms which exit the muscle and migrate out onto the skin of the next host the mosquito feeds on. This L3 stage is primed to infect humans.

This kind of parasitism is common since it allows for horizontal transmission between definitive hosts. And if you are a parasite that needs to get to the bloodstream, what better way to get passed around than through a blood sucking insect?"
946,"Before the bicycle was invented, did people know a two wheeled vehicle would stay upright?","[Hoop rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoop_rolling) is an extremely old game that dates back to at least ancient Greece. Anyone who has ever played it (or done something similar like rolling a quarter along the ground) can tell you that a single wheel or hoop can roll quite a long distance and in pretty close to a straight line without a huge amount of trouble. That's especially true if you're able to follow along with it and sort of tap it when it starts to veer to one side or the other. Which is exactly what you have to do if you're riding the very earliest kind of bicycle, the velocipede, which is propelled by running along the ground. From there, it's not a stretch to notice that the speed of a device like that is really limited by your running speed, and that it seems to need less intervention the faster it moves -- which gets you to thinking about ways to propel the device more quickly via human power.

As to why it took so long for the bicycle to be invented after the wheel, I think the answer is probably quite complicated but is almost certainly linked to 1) the amount of skill and time required to design and build something that is plausibly functional even as a velocity is quite substantial. Material constraints would have been a big problem (although the first velocipede was made almost entirely out of wood, it still used metal for things like bushings and tires, and for most of human history making things out of metal was very expensive). The simple availability of surplus labor would have been an issue too. In much of pre-modern agricultural history, in order to support a society, most people had to spend most of their time farming. And I think one last major issue would have been road quality. Bicycles in general, and especially early bicycles, don't handle rough terrain particularly well. In the early history of the bicycle, they were banned in some places because riders really preferred to ride on the sidewalk/pavement rather than the road, which was interfering with pedestrian traffic.

I think it all really almost certainly comes down to resources. With about the same amount of time, effort, and material it takes to build two bicycles, which are basically only suited for individual human transportation (at least before modern construction and infrastructure), you can build a simple cart that can carry hundreds of pounds of stuff at a time. That seems far more useful than a bicycle. I wouldn't be surprised if hundreds or even thousands of individual cart makers who had more time and money than sense experimented with things that looked kind of like bicycles from the invention of the wheel up to roughly the 1800s, but those inventions probably never went anywhere for the reasons I discussed."

[This article goes a bit into the process and difficulty for doing it with lead.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-lead-can-be-turned-into-gold/). While the same process that's used for bismuth can be used, the difficulty is separating the lead from the gold afterwards."
949,Why are recently flipped iceburgs blue?,"Recently flipped icebergs are blue because ice is blue, and it isn't scattering light.

The blue shade in ice is because ice absorbs light much more strongly at wavelengths other than blue; light will travel about 100 fold further through ice at 400 nm wavelength (blue) versus 700 nm (red). See Fig 3 [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://atmos.uw.edu/~sgw/PAPERS/2019_PCIce.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwis5LTjnJD-AhXgXWwGHXVFCEoQFnoECAIQAg&usg=AOvVaw1cH0afNFqZ6zEip3e7-PTw) for a rough plot of the absorption spectra. Therefore, if white light is shining through a big block of ice, you'll see more of the blue light make it through unaffected than the yellow, green, red, etc light, and the end result will be blue.

Now, you might notice that snow is made from ice crystals, but it isn't blue. The reason for that is light scatters off interfaces. Snow has lots of air/ice interfaces. The scattering off those interfaces is much less sensitive to wavelength than the absorption is, so the scattered light is much more even across the spectrum. In simple words, white light in will scatter evenly, and you'll get white light out.

Why does this matter for icebergs? Two reasons: first, the ice has relatively few airbubbles in it, it's been compacted down heavily. If you pull out an ice cube from your freezer, you'll notice cracks and bubbles. Those can scatter that light, and make it appear white. Under the crushing weight of the glacier, however, the ice has been forced in as tight as it can go, and a lot of those bubbles and cracks have been forced out of the ice. So, there's fewer things to scatter off, and the ice will be less white. Note, however, that things can be entrained in the ice to change its colour. The link above discusses a few in a section a page or two past Fig 3.

The second reason it matters, is that water melts stuff, and melting smooths things. If you look at the top of an iceberg, it's white. It's covered in snow, yes, but also the ice surface is rougher. There's lots of little facets and such that again scatter light heavily, and make things white. However, when you stick it in water, that changes. Now, the water around the iceberg isn't necessarily hugely warmer. Indeed, it may actually be below the freezing point of pure water (since salt in the water depresses freezing points, which is why people salt roads in snowy climates incidentally). Whatever it is, though, it's going to interact with the ice surface and **smooth it out.** 

That smoothing is because surfaces have some energy associated with them, and a rough surface is more surface. Physics wants to minimise potential energy, and much as a ball will roll down a hill, surfaces in dynamic systems will rearrange themselves to minimise that surface energy. You see it in liquids all the time, it's what causes surface tension. Now, I should point out it's a little more complicated than just area, and that leads into why snowflakes grow the way they do, but basically all else being equal the pointy bits of ice with lots of surface, and not much volume will be ""high energy"" and the big flat surfaces will be ""low energy"", and the water in that ice will try and move from high to low. So, over time, those pointy bits will melt and the flat surfaces will grow (or at least melt slower), making the ice flatter. 

So, end result is you have a smoother surface with less defects that can scatter light. So now you can see the inherent colour of the ice better. And ice, as we've said before... Is blue."
950,could an approach of targeting CCR5 receptors to inactive/destroy it be used to gain HIV immunity?,"So CCR5 is an essential coreceptor for HIV viral entry to the cell, and yes removing it would complicate a virus to enter and induce pathogenesis affiliated with HIV. As a matter of fact, we have been working on CCR5 antagonists for a number of years (see Maraviroc, Aplaviroc, Vicriviroc, Leronlimab, etc). 

Just know the role of ccr5 is not limited to HIV receptor entry, as it participates in a number of GPCR signaling pathways related to granulocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as a healthy pro inflammatory process in general terms. If you simply remove it completely the systemic effects may be without value to those with or without HIV."
951,"Can a photon, from a source other than the sun, pass through the sun completely? In summary, does the sphere of the sun cast a shadow if there were a much brighter light source on the other side of it?","The sun is not transparent. The visible surface of the sun would be the same even if you disregarded all the emitted light and only considered how much it obscures background objects. Looking at the limb of the sun it can be seen that the sun's surface turns from fully transparent to fully opaque over a distance of maybe hundreds of km as the density of the solar plasma increases the deeper you go. The measure of how translucent something is, ie. how much stuff is needed between you and an object to obscure the latter, is called [optical depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth_(astrophysics\)) or optical thickness.

Plasma is particularly good at being opaque, as being an ionized gas, all the free electrons in it are very happy to absorb and scatter light as it goes through, much moreso than the same amount of neutral gas would.

The fact that stars are, indeed, opaque, can be exploited to find binary stars, particularly dimmer companions in close orbits around a brighter, more massive star. If the pair orbits edge-on from our perspective, such that the components [transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit) each other, each transit causes a tiny dip in the binary's total brightness because some of either star's light is blocked by its companion."
952,"I read that one of the issues with desalination plants is the potentially toxic brine waste product. Could this be used for other purposes, possibly for reactor coolant? Or at least safely stored away like we do with nuclear waste?","So it might help to understand the process here and why we end up with brine instead of salt.


So first, desalination at large industrial scales is done via reverse osmosis. This process is basically pushing cleaned seawater up against a membrane. The water can pass through the membrane, but the salt dissolved in the water cannot.

This is much more efficient process than desalination via boiling and condensation. However, it also gets harder and harder to remove only the water from a liquid as the salt concentration increases. For example, if you have a gallon of seawater, separating one cup of pure water from the gallon is easy. But you are left with the same amount of salt in less than 1 gallon of water. The second cup is harder to extract, and makes the remaining liquid more salty. This is why we end up with brine instead of the pure solid salt that you might end up with if you were boiling or heating the water to desalinate it by distillation. 


If, like you suggested, we wanted to use the salt for other purposes, such as using molten salt in a reactor, it would need additional processing. You would have to first remove the rest of the water, and then purify the salt. This would take quite a lot of energy and additional money.


But it could be done. The problem is how much water flows through desalination plants, and how much salt that would make.

The largest desalination plant can produce 1 billion litres of water a day. Let us assume we are 100% efficient and use up 1 billion litres of water (in reality, more seawater would be needed to make 1 billion litres of freshwater).

1 litre of water has ~35 grams of salt. That means the desalination plant could produce 35 thousand metric tons of salt a day. Or, over 12 million metric tons of salt a year.


How much salt is that?


The entire US used approximately 59 million metric tons of salt in 2022. That means, a single desalination plant would produce about 20% of the countries salt needs. However, the  US uses over 300 billion gallons of water per day. So, in order to create enough water for only 1.5% of our water needs, we would create approximately 100% of our salt needs.


Simply put, it is ALOT of salt. Trying to just store the salt, would be a massive undertaking that would also be prohibitively expensive. The real best environmental option is to basically build a much larger network of pipes that puts the brine back in the ocean, but over a large enough area that it does not do environmental harm.


As a bonus, besides the obvious fact that the amount of salt in all of the nuclear reactors in the world is miniscule compared to the potential output of a desalination plant. There is also the problem that salt used as reactor coolent is not the same salt we find in the ocean."
953,Is Lineweaver-Burk linearization only valid for constant enzyme concentration?,"Yes, a typical Michaelis-Menten assay is performed at a constant enzyme concentration, and the kinetics would change if you change the enzyme concentration. In order to make kinetic values comparable across enzymes, a high concentration of enzyme is used such that the kinetic equation reduces to a function of the substrate concentration(s) only. At a mechanistic level, this means that a very small fraction of the enzymes are in the substrate-bound state at any given time, such that the enzyme concentration is effectively unchanged at higher substrate concentrations.

Edit: I looked back at this and saw I missed part of your scenario. See the other answer here for how to plot them on the same chart. The key point is that you have three different lines representing three different kinetic behaviors, one for each enzyme concentration."
954,Why are divergent boundary located in specific places?,"[Mid-ocean ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge) are generally located in the middle of ocean basins because mid-ocean ridge spreading is typically symmetric. To back up, a mid-ocean ridge represents what originally started off as a [continental rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift), something like the [East African Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift) today. As extension continues, eventually the crust is thinned enough that mantle partial melting starts to occur, producing basalts and forming the beginnings of an ocean basin. This thinned crust, and the melting that occurs, tends to be broadly symmetric in cross section, e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge#/media/File:Mid-ocean_ridge_cut_away_view.png). Thus, generally what we see at mid-ocean ridges is that the rate of oceanic crust creation is approximately the same on either side of the ridge. For example, if we imagine a north-south oriented, newly formed mid-ocean ridge, we would generally expect the rate of new oceanic crust being formed on the west side of this ridge to equal the rate on the east side of this ridge as well. So if this rate was X mm/yr, if we stand on the ridge, the plate to the west of us is moving away from us at X mm/yr and the plate to the east of us is also moving away from us at X mm/yr (and thus, if we stood on the west plate, the east plate moving is away from us at 2X mm/yr). With this symmetric spreading, geometrically, you're going to end up with a mid-ocean ridge that maintains a central position within that ocean basin as long as the only thing that is happening in that ocean basin is spreading (i.e., it's an ocean basin rimmed by [passive margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin)). This broadly describes what we see in the Atlantic Ocean.

Now, if we look at [plate boundaries](https://geography-revision.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plate-boundaries.jpg) globally, we can see that not all mid-ocean ridges are in the middle of ocean basins. For example, in the Pacific most of the mid-ocean ridge systems are more skewed to the east side of the basin. This reflects that the Pacific basin is no longer rimmed by passive margins, but instead by [subduction zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) where the oceanic crust/lithosphere is returning back to the mantle. As a result, and depending on the relative rates of subduction vs spreading and the geometry of the margins, generally those eastern ridges are moving toward the eastern subduction zones over time. The evolution of these geometries and relationships since the break up of Pangea can be [visualized](https://portal.gplates.org/cesium/?view=AgeGrid), which can help kind of clarify what's happening in different places.

Finally, it's worth mentioning that we typically consider mid-ocean ridges ""passive"" features in terms of their location. What this means, is that counter to kind of the common cartoon in secondary school Earth Science classes where mid-ocean ridges represent the rising limb of large convection cells in the mantle and subduction zones represent the downgoing limb of large convection cells, this is broadly not the case. Subudction zones are important in driving convection in the mantle and can be thought of as the downgoing limbs in a sense, but ridges are more passive cracks and the material sourced to form oceanic lithosphere through melting is quite shallow (effectively drawing from the [asthenosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere) and very upper mantle), not deep upwellings (and thus their locations are not particularly fixed). If you want a deeper treatment, check out our [FAQ on drivers of plate motions](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/). As a result of their passive, non-fixed nature, ridges can also somewhat easily ""jump"", i.e., a mid-ocean ridge can shut off and reform in a new part of the ocean basin. There is a tendency (but not a strict requirement) for these to reform vaguely in the ""middle"" of basins, but really, where they form represents where the stress state in the plate as a whole favors the formation of an extensional system."
955,"If the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is growing by 2.5cm per year in an east-west direction, are we losing earth somewhere else?","Yes, at [subduction zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction). Broadly speaking and at a global scale, any total increase in plate sizes from creation of sea floor at mid-ocean ridges will be balanced by subduction of sea floor *somewhere* else. 

One thing to clarify is that this doesn't imply that spreading is perfectly balanced by subduction of the *same* plate or adjacent to the *same* plate. While, it's certainly possible to have a plate that is effectively maintaining a constant surface area with paired equal subduction and half-spreading rates on opposite sides, it's not required (and not even necessarily common). Take the [North American Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate) for example. It broadly has spreading on the east side (i.e., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and subduction on the west side, but in most places it is the overriding plate (i.e., a plate, mostly the Pacific plate, is subducitng underneath it) meaning that the North American plate is broadly getting larger at the moment. To some extent, the western half of spreading of the Mid-Atlantic is balanced by subduction of the Pacific plate beneath, but it does not need to sum to zero on the basis of just these two plates^(1). What is required (in the sense of conservation of mass) is that spreading/extension in aggregate is balanced by subduction/underthrusting in aggregate across the whole surface of the planet. 

The above also isn't just an assumption. We can measure plate velocities with techniques like GPS and show that we if consider chains of relative velocities, i.e., *plate circuits* (e.g., velocity of plate A with respect to B, plate C with respect to B, plate D with respect to C, plate E with respect to D, and plate A with respect to E), the velocities sum to zero within error. This is consistent with the idea that spreading is balanced *on average* with subduction (and that the planet is neither increasing or decreasing in volume / surface area).

*^(1)And it broadly does not. If we use a [plate motion calculator](https://www.unavco.org/software/geodetic-utilities/plate-motion-calculator/plate-motion-calculator.html) to calculate the relative velocity of a spot in the middle of the North American plate (40N, 100W) with respect to the Pacific plate, we get that North America is moving 17.7 mm/yr east and 23.3 mm/yr south (or 29.2 mm/yr at an azimuth of 142) with respect to the Pacific plate. If calculate the relative velocity of that same spot with respect to the Eurasian plate, we get that North America is moving 22.4 mm/yr west and 5.5 mm/yr south (or 23 mm/yr at an azimuth of 256) with respect to Eurasia. While overly simplified (especially since plate motions are really rotations, and comparing linear velocities at a point, like we're doing is ignoring this), this gets the point across that spreading at the Mid-Atlantic is not perfectly balanced by subduction of the Pacific, i.e., the relative velocities are not equal. Or alternatively, we can look at [estimates of absolute plate motions](http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ftp/maps/plate_tectonics_simple.morvel.sa.1.pdf), i.e., the rate and directions of plate motions relative a similar non-moving reference. In this view, it's easy to see that the sum of Pacific - North America - Eurasia plate motion does not equal zero. Per the above though, if we summed all of the velocities of all of the plates, they would equal approximately zero.*"
956,Do typical ocular defects have an effect on colour sight?,"Not nearsightedness, shortsightedness, or astigmatism, but cataracts do reduce perception of blue, green, & purple, leaving the world looking redder & yellower & oranger. Claude Monet was particularly frustrated & upset by this, and, because he tended to paint the same subjects more than once, he ended up documenting his shift in color perception by painting the same thing in blue & green one year and red & yellow a later year. After getting cataract surgery, he was embarrassed by how wrong his more recent pre-surgery paintings had been and started destroying or ""retouching"" any that he could still get his hands on."
957,Why does gravity increase entropy as matter collapses or is attracted to each other?,"The state of a system is specified by the positions and velocities (or momenta) of its particles, not the positions alone. Accordingly, a system's entropy -- which counts the number of particle configurations -- involves an integral over the system's volume *in 6-dimensional position-velocity space*, not just 3-dimensional position space. Gravitational collapse compresses a system in position space, but the infalling particles gain velocity. This is why the entropy does not decrease.

Edit: I should add that the above is true in situations where the system's energy is conserved, like the collapse of primordial regions of excess density into dark matter halos. In many situations, like galaxy, star, and planet formation, energy is not conserved because some is radiated away during the process. In that scenario the system can lose entropy, but if you also include the entropy of the radiation, total entropy still does not decrease."
958,What does it mean when people say that quantum mechanics is probabilistic?,"Quantum Mechanics has as afundamental idea that ""perfect"" information is not possible for an individual particle.  The precise definition of the state of a particle is defined as a probability of multiple possible states, only resolving into a definitive state upon measurement.

It is important to understand that experiments appear to affirm the idea that the state of the particle is determined by the measurement (quantum physicists like to say that its waveform collapses).  Hidden additional information that might lead to the appearance of uncertainty does not show up in experiments designed to reveal the telltale signs of finer informational structures.

Quantum mechanics is arguably the most mathematically rigorous branch of physics.  The confusing theoretical predictions match the experimental results well enough that it appears more complete as a theory than most other areas of physics (baring quantum electrodynamics contradicting general relativity)."
959,"Why is the feeling of nictotine short, but in your blood for 48 hours?","To answer the question specifically, the nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) undergo something called [reversible desensitisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899306005130?via%3Dihub) after continued exposure to nicotine. Initially, there's an increase in ion conductance through the receptor, which is then followed by reversible desensitisation. That's why you feel a short high that decreases pretty quickly.

For chronic users, it's slightly different because the number of nAChRs is upregulated (meaning more of them are expressed) due to chronic exposure. So in that case they might need to smoke a bit more to compensate."
960,"Let’s say we open up a completely sealed off underground cave. The organisms inside are completely alien to anything native to earth. How exactly could we tell if these organisms evolved from earth, or from another planet?","First, we could compare certain features that are common to all life on earth. For example many of the building blocks of life such as sugars and amino acids can come in two versions, left-handed and right-handed, which are mirrors of each other.  All known life on earth can only use right-handed sugar molecules.  At the same time all the amino acids used are the left-handed versions.   If we were to find a life form that used the opposite version of either (or both) it would be a strong indicator it wasn’t related to any other existing life on earth.  

Speaking of amino acids and DNA, that’s another example.  All life on earth uses DNA, and that DNA stores information using the same 4 nucleotides, cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T].  If we were to discover a life form which either did not use DNA at all or had DNA which used some other nucleotides it would also be a strong indication that such life is not related to any life on earth."

964,"Since the Moon has a negligible atmosphere, why hasn't it's water ice been lost to sublimation?","Ice in vacuum will sublimate rapidly until it cools to about -70 C. There's still some sublimation (vapor pressure is never zero) but the colder you get the slower it is. This is how icy bodies in the outer solar system continue to exist. See also: the concept of the frost line in astrophysics, the distance from the sun where ice can exist in space for a reasonable amount of time.

[Shackleton Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shackleton_\(crater\)) near the south pole of the moon maintains a brutally cold -183 C.

965,Can you jump higher on the side of the moon that faces earth because of earths gravity (that pulls you away from the moon) compared to the side that faces away from earth (because here earths gravity pulls you back to the moon) ?,"No. You jump highest when the earth is directly overhead *and* when it's directly under your feet. You jump lowest when the earth RISES and SETS on the horizon.

The constant acceleration of the moon towards the earth cancels out the gravitational pull of the earth on your body. However when you're farthest from the earth, the gravitational pull is *weaker* (so you jump higher) and when you're closest to the earth the gravitational pull is *stronger* (so you also jump higher). This is also how the tides work: high tides are directly underneath the other body AND directly opposite the other body.

968,How does being deaf in one ear impact brain functions?,"Some brain functions appear to be localized more to one brain hemisphere than the other, with language being the most prominent example: it seems to mostly reside in the left hemisphere. This is called ""lateralization"", and while it is a real thing that some neuroscientists study, it is nowhere near as dramatic as (bad) popular science media would have you believe. For most brain functions, there is at most a slight bias to one hemisphere over the other, but both sides are involved. It's also not the case (as is commonly suggested) that different hemispheres process information in a (substantially) different manner (e.g. that the left hemisphere would be more ""analytical"" while the right is more ""creative""). 

Moreover, there is no good scientific basis to the idea that one can be more ""left-brained"" or ""right-brained"", or that you can do things to make your brain use one hemisphere more (e.g. ""I want to be more creative so I'm going to listen to this music which will 'activate' my right hemisphere""). This is pure pseudoscience and you should not trust anyone or any source that takes this idea seriously. 

As for hearing in particular: both ears are actually connected to the auditory cortex in both hemispheres. Also, the two hemispheres are strongly connected to each other, so the left auditory cortex ""talks"" to the right a great deal, and vice versa. Besides which, the brain, and especially the young developing cortex, is incredibly flexible. If you grow up deaf in one ear, the cortex will adapt to that.

So no, all in all, there is absolutely no reason to think that being deaf in your right ear will make you more creative, or process sound more creatively."
