Germany is a tricky one, because it was the name that the Roman Empire gave to that area. But the very people didn’t call themselves that.

However, remote places kept the reference to the Roman name. And adding that until 250 years ago the fastest way you could travel was on a horse, people stuck with a lot of exonyms, letting them be cemented into language long before we had more direct communication.",0

Short answer is yes you can eat beef in such a situation. There is a concept we practice called ahimsa which means “non violence”. Ahimsa is where the idea of vegetarianism comes from in our faith. 

However “violence” is allowed in situations of self defense etc. that is the exact moral dilemma Arjun faces in the Bhagavad Geetha. Arjuna was an ancient king who was faced with the moral dilemma of killing his own evil brothers. The Bhagavad Geetha is a conversation between God (Krishna) and king Arjun about this moral dilemma. Basically God tells Arjun he must follow his Dharma and sometimes commit violence to prevent harm to others. 

Eating beef to survive is similar to self defense. 

There’s a good section on non-human life here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa",0

Which is why you see the older style Captchas infrequently if at all.

The newer style, reCaptcha, uses a completely different method.  It looks at how you use the computer and internet.  That's why it's often a ""not a robot"" checkbox and nothing else.  It's looking at reaction times, how steady your mouse movements are, what kind of computer you're using, and even your browsing history (you agree to it by using the service, thank you google and overlybroad terms of use).  People and robots use computers very differently, even if the robot is designed to mimic how a person uses the computer.  If it's still not sure by the time you click the checkbox then you go to the ""click all squares containing.""  which gives it more chances to look at how the computer is being used to determine if it's a person or not.

Netflix doesn't divulge much specific info on viewership, so we may never know what is spurring this surprising Woody Woodpecker revival.

These guys can vary though in how much they work with the police. Most LEOs across the US say such predator hunters should not meet the predators in person, but forward their chat logs to the police and leave it at that. More often than not, although exposing them on their channel does a number on these predators' psyche, their careless attitude and lack of professionalism leads to the individual not being arrested. 

In a number of cases, LEOs have explicitly asked these predator catchers to *stop* because they are *doing more harm than good* and the predators featured in their videos often *get away scott-free*. 

It's not just about whether someone is breaking the law, it's often about whether the state can actually prosecute them based off information gathered by the third party organisations, who often have patreons or a general interest in making more videos on these guys rather than actually getting them arrested.

This is a very touchy subject, but I made a video on a particular organisation a while back, called D.A.P. If you care to, you can watch it [here.](https://youtu.be/VA8pH42B_Q8?si=Y5YqwHcPmt_s1vDA)

Keep in mind that a few months after I posted this video, D.A.P began charging their viewers to watch videos of them physically assaulting the alleged predators and eventually went and got themselves shot in the middle of a grocery store, putting their lives, the innocent bystanders' lives, and the employee's lives in danger.",0

You lost a project, your colleague got the project. Get over it and learn from it.

You are doing work in a field that really doesn’t give many fucks about technical merits. And business in general doesn’t care for what you desire. Arts and entertainment are entirely subjective. You could be a master of your craft and there will be people that vehemently hate your style. Nothing you can do about it.

Maybe his work sucks, as you say. Or maybe it’s not bad and you just can’t take the sting from losing the project. You’re being overly critical to save face, rather than accept that it just didn’t work out.

Maybe being a people pleaser isn’t as bad, especially when you have a paying client that you need to keep happy. Clients like people who are easy to work with. If they are paying you for to bring their vision to life, they don’t want to deal with some bullshit all the time.

I think predators like dogs and cats might have a more complicated system of communication because their forward-facing eyes make turning to focus on you a much clearer message.

Being aware that another creature can see as you see and remember as you remember (as opposed to simply using eyes to communicate/instinctively percieving eye contact as a threat or botched hunt) is a higher level of intellect, part of ""theory of mind"".

262,It’s a very common practice in real life as well. It’s used to try and save face or preemptively defend themselves when they want to do or say something they know will be perceived negatively.

263,"Depends on what you mean by putting on some muscle. If you just want to be “in decent shape”, you have to pay some attention to your diet, but not necessarily your full focus. If you want to be absolutely ripped, yes you have to optimise your diet, well you have optimise almost every aspect of your life around that goal. 

If by protein complementary food, you mean protein bars and shakes, the bars get really expensive, and the shakes you can make by yourself could be relatively cheap, but ultimately it’s best to get your protein from less processed sources like chicken breast, if you can. 

If you are skinny, you do have to eat enough to bulk up. But if you are just looking to be reasonably toned with a bit of muscle, it shouldn’t be necessary to strictly count your calories and count your every macronutrient, and you don’t need to go to the extremes of eating 3000 calories with 150g of protein or anything huge like that. 

If you are a beginner to weightlifting, you can build some level of muscle relatively easy and quickly before you hit a plateau. Follow a simple lifting routine like the stronglifts 5x5 plan, do it 3x a week, eat a bit more than your usual and try to focus on protein sources. You can use a scale to monitor if you are slowly gaining weight. If you want to progress beyond that and get even more muscular, then you can consider from then on. But the best thing to do is to get started and get yourself used to a routine, after that you can decide whether to become even more dedicated and make it even more complex. 

People in prison still get muscular, even for those who can’t count calories and macros and can’t eat whatever they want. Manual laborers in developing nations are lean-muscular. One of my friends works out and is quite muscular, and what he eats is just whatever is food leftover at the bar at the end of shift (he works as a bartender).

266,"Ever heard of [Ariel Castro?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_Castro_kidnappings) He was sentenced to 1,000 years in prison. That's ridiculous, right? Nobody could possibly live that long! But it turns out that even a sentence like that is actually pretty reasonable.

Those super long sentences are actually the result of *multiple* crimes being added together. Castro's thousand-year sentence is actually the result of **937** counts of kidnapping, rape and aggravated murder. When you add up the punishment for all those crimes, you may instead wonder why he wasn't given a *longer* sentence!

There's a good reason why courts do it this way - three, actually. First, it's part of giving justice to victims. The victim of the crime and their families deserve to know that the offender is getting punished for what they did to *them*, whether or not they are already getting punished for a different crime they committed. Secondly, it prevents the criminal from getting released if they are able to overturn *one* of their sentences on appeal. And thirdly, it can help keep that person in prison! In many countries, a life sentence isn't actually for life - it could mean a set number of years (25 or 15), or it could come with the possibility of parole after some time has passed. In other countries, someone must serve a percentage of their full sentence before they are eligible for parole (one third of their sentence in Canada, for example) or before they are moved from prison to house arrest (two-thirds of their sentence in Minnesota, for example). If someone has a sentence of 200 years, then even one-third of that is going to be long enough that it won't matter much to survivors.",0

457,"That is a lot of mileage on a vehicle.  That is a HUGE expense for gas and proper vehicle maintenance.    If you correctly report this commute to your auto insurance company, your auto insurance rates will likely go up also.  (most insurance companies want to know how far you drive to work - it is part of the calculation for your insurance.)  It isn't really making more money if that money is going into your gas tank instead of your wallet.

If this salary is based on a 40 hour work week and you are also driving 2 hours per day - then you actually have a 50 hour work week.  You can't really do much to make up for the time spent driving.  (maybe use the time for digital books - otherwise, it is just lost time that was lost because of your job)  Your time is valuable and giving up too much of just to get to and from work is a waste.

If you have no job - then take it.  Anything is better than nothing most of the time.  If you currently have a job, then take a very good look at how much it might cost you to drive so far vs what you spend to get to and from work right now.  Are you really gaining something from changing jobs?  Of course, if you hate your current situation or if this company is your ""dream job"", then the move may be worth it at any cost.  

I am just trying to tell you that sometimes the numbers sound good and look good on paper until you realize how much other things it is costing you for this change.

There is also the consideration of moving closer to the job to reduce the commute if possible.  Work it for a while to make sure you are going to stay there and then move closer.",0

460,"This is tricky because there was no real established successor line aside from the general rules of Empirical inherency. There was never a peaceful change of power in the First French Empire, so there was no tradition or custom to follow. 

Depending on when Napoleon died, his son could have taken over. IIRC, when Napoleon abdicated finally in 1815, he named his son as the new Emperor. This is the expect line of succession for an Emperor. Of course, his son was just a boy, so regent would likely be assigned (who that regent would be, it's hard to say).

If Napoleon died before having his son, I could see Joseph Bonaparte (Napoleon's older brother) taking over, or at least having the strongest ""legitimate"" claim.

However, it would unlikely be this simple. There would no doubt be a power struggle between his marshals, his family, and there would likely be a monarchist surge at the time as well.",0
461,"Try just setting new expectations, if you generally initiate, then theyre expecting you to continue to do so, and thats not necessarily a bad thing.

462,"> Is it based on where you are?

Yes.

>  What if your GPS isn't working? 

It doesn't use your GPS, since only your phone knows its own GPS coordinates. Your phone is connected to a nearby cellphone tower, so your location for the emergency services is based around the location of the tower.

>  If I visit say China and call 911 who is gonna get my call its not gonna be the local authorities, so what station would get the call and why?

Nobody will get the call, because 911 is an invalid number in China. Countries have different emergency numbers. For example in Europe the number is 112 (however some countries will have 911 or 112 direct to their emergency number).",0

An object moving at light speed or anywhere near it wouldn't movie slowly enough to be recorded unless the object was many millions of miles away at the start, and so large that you could see it from that distance. That would basically be like a planet sized asteroid, and it would move in and out of any kind of visual standpoint so quickly that it would be pure freakish luck if you could take a picture of it at all, and even if you got lucky the object would just look like a blur, even at a rate of 1,000 photos per second.

In short, there's nothing that could move at that speed that's also big enough to be seen if it was moving anywhere near light speed. Something the size of a jet wouldn't be within range of sight for more than like 0.000000000000000001 seconds",0

Since writing is a volatile field, even accomplished writers may be out of work for months at a time between shows. This is why residuals where worth it over a lower pay rate. That way if you had a successful show that tends to run reruns, you have consistent income even between jobs. The problem is that since we are moving more and more towards streaming, residuals dont really make sense the way they used to. A big part of the negotiation are about new ways to calculate residuals that make sense with modern streaming.

The other big problem is that writing for a streaming service sort of sucks. There has been a big push to make writing more like the gig economy. Where writers are rotated between projects with very little long term prospects. There are jobs to be had, but the expectation is that those jobs dont last more than a few months by design. Obviously volatile employment is nothing new to writers, but the dream of writing for a long term successful show is becoming more and more elusive. Even if you do write for a successful show, you still cant build a career out of it.

These are the big issues.",0

745,"Well I can't say for everyone, but atleast for me, once you get familiar with the language, you can kind of guess which one to use. Idk, if this makes sense to you? 
How I learned english is mostly due exposure to the english language. I grew up watching a lot of english/american shows. Or even anime where the spoken language would be japanese but the subtitles in english. So as I grew up with this kind of exposure, you automatically get familiar with for example, in this case, prepositions that don't really have any grammatical ruling. That aside, if I did make mistakes, I still got corrected when I was in secondary school as english (it was standard british english though) was and still is a mandatory class you have to take. 

That aside, what also might be the reason is because I'm from a country where we have multiple official languages. So I already got exposed to a different language outside my native one from a young age in school( I'm talking about 8-9 years old, that would be 3rd grade for you guys right?). So I might pickup those grammatical rulings (that technically don't make any sense) in languages faster than maybe other people who never really got exposed to a different language from a young age.",0

If you are in a US state, your state's motor vehicle department may suspend your license & registration if you have a registered car / good tags, but do not have insurance.  Let them know you are not driving, and turn in your plates/tags if you need to until you get insurance.   

(2) Do you really have the paperwork and evidence to go back over things from 2021?   You're going to have to convince the other person's insurance company to reopen the case and pay for things.   In some states, things are ""no - fault"", so each side pays their own damages.    For you to overturn this, you probably need to show more than just a communication error.  You almost certainly got a letter when it was over, showing all your insurance paid.   
You would need to show that your insurer did not pay for your rental, and/or convince the other side to pay for the rental and any other expenses your insurer had.   

(3) Insurance ""points"" are different than motor vehicle record points.    The insurance companies know if we plea down a speeding ticket - we still get insurance points.   They assign points if we are in an accident, and more points if they have to pay.    Every insurer gets to make up their own point system.

The premises, if true, fairly well lead to the socialist's conclusion. And premise A is probably true, I think most would agree. However, premises B and C are not really a given. They are very bold assumptions made by your socialist. In order for the conclusion to be cogent, the premises must first be proven to be true. 

At a certain point in their arguments, each of your examples makes an unfounded assumption as part of their logic. Question one of those assumptions and the argument breaks down.

It is possible that, given enough time, nuclear missiles could be shot down before they reach their intended targets. This is because, as with other types of missiles, they can be detected and intercepted, either by enemy air defenses or by anti-missile defense systems. If such an interception should occur, then the warhead could be destroyed without detonating or a dud might result, depending on the type of missile used. 

Just like during WWII, it is also possible that nukes could be dropped as bombs. In a nuclear war, an aggressor might want to engage in nuclear bombing or, at the very least, threaten to do so. This could be done with precision aircraft, cruise missiles, bombers, or manually delivered weapons, some of which are air-street, or air-to-surface.",1

There is no scientific evidence to suggest that pitbulls (or any breed of dog for that matter) are inherently evil. Breeds of dogs, like breed prejudice that can exist in humans, is often a result of a society’s tendency to choose a victim, and prejudices and associated features are assigned to them.

In the case of pitbulls, this began in the 1980s when the media sensationalized and demonized the breed after a string of attacks and news articles depicting pitbulls as vicious and wild animals. This led to a strong public opinion that pitbulls were dangerous animals and created the idea in people’s minds that all members of this breed are wild and dangerous.

Although pitbulls were not always demonized, fear and stigma associated with many breeds of dog have been around for a long time. Rottweilers are a prime example of this with incidents of aggression that eventually seen the breed deemed dangerous.

The takeaway is that the backgrounds and experiences of individual dogs, not their breed, should determine their character and behavior. All dogs can be dangerous and aggressive if improperly trained and socialized. Responsible owners should always prioritize training, socialization, proper health and nutrition, and exercise for their dogs regardless of breed.",1

Society is designed for morning people because the default schedule for businesses, jobs, school and other activities typically revolves around a 9 to 5 model which is traditionally designed to accommodate the majority of the population who are morning people. This is primarily a consequence of traditional labor practices rather than any inherent bias against night owls.

That said, night owls face unique challenges that many employers may not be aware of. Being a productive night owl in a morning-focused world often involves managing both discrimination and exhaustion. Even though there is increasing awareness and understanding of the benefits that different sleeping patterns can bring to productivity and wellbeing, there is still a significant amount of stigma attached to being a night owl, and that can make it difficult for employers to provide flexi-time or other arrangements to accommodate these alternative sleeping patterns.",1

The 99% of shared DNA between humans and chimpanzees is an estimate based on research of the overall genetic similarity between the two species. On the other hand, the 50% of shared DNA between two human siblings comes from the way that parental chromosomes recombine to form the full set of chromosomes for an offspring. For example, out of the two chromosomes from a parent, the new offspring might get one full chromosome of each type, and those two chromosomes will be different from the original two sets of chromosomes from the parents. Therefore, two siblings will never share the exact same set of chromosomes, only about 50% of the genes.",1

The way the British Empire is viewed today is complicated and largely shaped by historical events and attitudes. On the one hand, the British Empire is associated with oppressive colonization and exploitation of foreign lands. On the other hand, the British Empire is also remembered for its introduction of democracy, rule of law, and other principles of western modernity that many countries view positively. 

In contrast, the Roman Empire is often remembered as a romantic period in history that is associated with grandeur and power. The Romans are credited with many influential architectural, engineering, and social achievements. Additionally, there is often a greater sense of distance and detachment from the Roman Empire than from the British Empire, as it was so long ago.

The tanker aircraft then initiates refueling, transferring fuel from the tanker to the receiver at pre-set rates and per agreed-to flying safety procedures.

AIDS is believed to have originated from chimpanzees that were infected with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV).

As the virus spread, it rapidly mutated, eventually leading to HIV, which eventually evolved into AIDS. 

Although the exact route of transmission from chimpanzees to humans is unknown, it is believed that significant contact between humans and chimpanzees—through hunting, butchering, or through infected needles—played a role in the cross-species transmission. 

After the virus was introduced to humans, the virus was believed to have initially spread mainly among heterosexual people. However, over time, HIV-infected blood was spread through homosexual people through unprotected sexual intercourse, and eventually, AIDS became associated with, and disproportionately impacted, homosexual men in many parts of the world.",1

African refugees seeking to relocate to Europe have a variety of migration choices available to them, depending on their individual circumstances. Those seeking asylum may apply to either the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or to individual European nation-states. Additionally, depending on visa requirements, African refugees may apply for family reunion permits, labor migration, educational exchange programs, or other kinds of humanitarian permits; all of which have varying requirements, timelines and success rates.

For African refugees who have already reached Europe without permission, there are often limited options available. Access to asylum is possible through the European Union’s Common European Asylum System, which is mostly based on the Geneva Convention. However, many European countries have tightened their asylum provisions in recent years, making it more difficult for refugees to be accepted. Additionally, once refugees have arrived in Europe, it can often be difficult for them to obtain the necessary documents to legally work or study, meaning that their choices are limited to either living in precarious situations or using illegal means to make money.

Whichever path African refugees choose, their journey is often fraught with danger, desperation, and disappointment. Although the choices may make their journey easier, an effective and safe transition to Europe is often a difficult, if not impossible, goal to achieve. Consequently, any attempt to reach Europe—be it legal or illegal—should be carefully considered, as even when a desirable outcome is attained, this can often come at the expense of the African refugee’s safety and well-being.",1
